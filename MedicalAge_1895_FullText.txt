LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF MEDI= 
CINE.* 

BY ROSWELL PARK, A.M., M.D. 
(Copyrighted.) 

Of the origin of medicine but little need be 
said by way of preface, save that it must have 
been nearly contemporaneous with the origin 
of civilization. The lower animals when sick 
or wounded instinctively lessen or alter their 
diet, seek seclusion and rest, and even in cer- 
tain cases seek out some particular herb or 
healing substance. Thus, too, does the sav- 
age in his primitive state; and experience 
and superstition together have led nearly all 
the savage tribes into certain habits and 
forms in case of injury or disease. But for 
us the history of medicine must necessarily 
begin with the written history of events, and 
its earliest endeavors need detain us but a 
very short time. Its earliest period is envel- 
oped in profound obscurity, and so mingled 
with myth and fable as to be very uncertain. 
It embraces an indefinite time, during which 
medicine was not a science, but an undigested 
collection of experimental notions, vaguely 
described, disfigured by tradition, often made 
inutile by superstition and ignorance. The 
earliest records of probable authenticity are 
perhaps to be met with in the Scriptures, 
from which may be gathered here and there 
a fair notion of Egyptian knowledge and 
practice. Thus we read that Joseph com- 
manded his servants and physicians to em- 
balm him — this being about 1700 b. c. It 
shows that Egypt at that time possessed a 
class of men who practiced the healing art, 
and that they also embalmed the dead, which

University of Buffalo, session of 1894-5. 



must have both required and furnished a 
crude idea of general anatomy. We are also 
informed from other sources that so supersti- 
tious were the Egyptians that they not only 
scoffed at, but would stone the embalmers, 
for whom they had sent, after the completion 
of their task. The probably mythical being 
whom the Egyptians called Thoth, whom the 
Greeks named Hermes, and the Latins Mer- 
cury, passed among the Egyptians as the in- 
ventor of all sciences and arts. To him are 
attributed an enormous number of writings 
concerning all subjects. Some have consid- 
ered him as identical with Bacchus, Zoro- 
aster, Osiris, Isis, Serapis, Apollo, and even 
Shem the Son of Noah. Others have thought 
him to be a god. It is now almost certain 
that the books attributed to Hermes were not 
the work of any one hand or of any one 
age. The last six volumes of the forty-two 
composing the encyclopedia, with which 
Hermes is credited, refer to medicine and 
embrace a body of doctrines fairly complete 
and well arranged. Of these six, the first 
treats of anatomy; the second, of diseases; 
the third, of instruments; the fourth, of rem- 
edies; the fifth, of diseases of the eye; and 
the sixth, of diseases of women. In complete- 
ness and arrangement it rivals if not sur- 
passes the Hippocratic collection, which it 
antedated by perhaps a thousand years. The 
Egyptians appear at first to have exposed 
their sick in public (at least, so says Strabo), 
so that if any of those who passed by had 
been similarly attacked they might give their 
advice for the benefit of the sufferers. In 
fact, according to Herodotus, the same custom 
prevailed among the Babylonians and Lusi- 
tanians. At a later date all who were thus 
cured were required to go to the temples and 
there inscribe their symptoms and what had 
helped them. The temples of Canopus and 
Vulcan at Memphis became the principal 
depdts for these records, which were kept as

were mainly studied by them, who later i 

of more or less

the kv thus collected an exclus 

pra : medicine. In this way 

they formed their medical code, which was 
called by Diodorus the 11 . Sa 

v, from whose directions they were in 

allowed • rve. It was perhaps this code 

which was later attributed to Hermes, and 
that made up the collection spoken of by 

■ment of Alexandria. If in following th- 
rules they could not save their patients they 
were held blameless, bir were punished with 
death if any departure from them were not 
followed by success. 

I have spoken of embalming as practiced 
by the Egyptians. It was of three grades: 
the first reserved for men of position and 
means, which cost one talent, and according 
to which the brain was removed by an open- 
ing through the nasal fossae, and the intes- 
tines through an opening on the left side of 
the abdomen, after which both cavities were 
stuffed with spices and aromatics; then the 
body was washed and spread over with gum 
and wrapped in bandages of linen. The 
second grade was adopted by families of 
moderate means; and the third was resorted 
to by the poor, consisting simply in washing 
of the body and maceration in lye for seventy 
days. 

Pliny assures us that the kings of Egypt 
permitted the opening of corpses for the pur- 
pose of discovering the causes of disease, 
but this was only permitted by the Ptolemies, 
under whose reign anatomy was carried to a 
very high degree of cultivation. 

The medicine of the Hebrews is known 
generally through the sacred scriptures, espe- 
cially through the writings attributed to 
Moses— which embraced rules of the highest 
sagacity, especially in public hygiene. The 
book of Leviticus is in large measure made 
up of rules concerning matters of public 
health. In the iith chapter, for instance, 
meat of the rabbit and the hog is proscribed, 
as apparently injurious in the climate of 
Egypt and India; it, however, has been sug-

leprosy, the measures suggested by M 

could not now be surpassed, although am 

authors have confounded under this name 
divers affections, probably including syphilis, 
to which, however, the same hygienic rules 
should apply. Next to Moses in medical 
lore should be mentioned Solomon, to whom 
is attributed a very high degree of knowledge 
of natural history, and who. Josephus claimed, 
had such perfect knowledge of the properties 
of all the productions of nature that he 
availed himself of it to compound remedies 
extremely useful, some of which had even the 
virtues necessary to cast out devils. 

The most conspicuous feature in the life 
of the Indian races is their division into 
castes, of which the most noble is that of the 
priests or Brahmins, who in ancient times 
alone had the privilege of practicing medi- 
cine. Their Organon of Medicine, or collec- 
tion of medical knowledge, was a book which 
they called Vagadasastir . It was not system- 
atically arranged, and in it demon* 
played a large role. They held the human 
body to consist of 100,000 parts, of which 
17,000 were vessels, each one of which was 
composed of seven tubes, giving passage to 
ten species of gases, which by their conflicts 
engendered a number of diseases. They 
placed the origin of the pulse in a reservoir 
located behind trie umbilicus. This was four 
fingers wide by two long, and divided into 
72,000 canals, distributed to all parts of the 
body. The physician examined not only the 
pulse of his patient, but the dejecta, consulted 
the stars, the Sight of birds, noted any inci- 
dental occurrence during his visits, and made 
up his prognosis from a multitude of varying 
circumstances, omitting only those which 
were really valuable, namely, the symptoms

indicating the state of the' organs. Ancient 
Hindoo charlatan priests let fall from the 
end of a straw a drop of oil into the patient's 
water. If the oil was precipitated and at- 
tached itself to the bottom of the vessel, they 
predicted an unfavorable result; if, on the 
contrary, it floated, they gave a favorable 
prognosis. This is, so far as we know, the 
earliest recorded way of testing the specific 
gravity of the urine. 

With all their absurdities, however, the In- 
dians appear to have done some things that 
we scarcely do to-day: they are said to have 
had an ointment that caused the cicatrices of 
variola to disappear, and they cured the bites 
of venomous serpents with remedies whose 
composition has been lost. 

The antiquity of the Chinese is simply lost 
in tradition and fable. From time immemor- 
ial their rulers have taken extraordinary care 
to prevent contact and interchange of ideas 
with foreigners. For 4000 years their man- 
ners, laws, religious beliefs, language and 
territory have scarcely changed. In this re- 
spect they stand alone among the nations of 
the earth. They attribute the invention of 
medicine to one of their emperors named 
Hoam-ti, who was the third of the first dy- 
nasty, and whose supposititious date is 2687 
b. c. He is considered to be the author of 
the work which still serves them as a medi- 
cal guide. It is, however, more probably an 
apocryphal book. Its philosophy was of a 
sphygmic kind — i. e., based upon the pulse, 
which they divided into the supreme or 
celestial, the middle, and the inferior or ter- 
restrial; by the examination of which the 
Chinese physician was supposed not only to 
show the seat of disease but to judge of its 
duration and gravity. It is related that one 
of the ancient Chinese emperors directed the 
dead bodies of criminals to be opened, but 
this is questionable, since it is certain that 
they have the most profound ignorance of 
rudimentary anatomy, and glaring errors 
abound in their system. ' Being thus replete 
with errors, and possessing no anatomical 
knowledge, their surgery was of the most bar- 
barous type. No one dared attempt a bloody 
operation; the reduction of hernia was un- 
known; a cataract was regarded as beyond 
their resources; and even venesection was 



never practiced. On the other hand they 
employed cups, and acupuncture, fomenta- 
tion, plasters of all kinds, lotions and baths. 
The moxa or red-hot button was in constant 
use, and they had their magnetizers who ap- 
pear to have been convulsionists. For a 
long time there existed at Pekin an Imperial 
School of Medicine, but now there is no such 
organization, nor any regulation for the privi- 
lege of practicing medicine or surgery since 
1792. At least until lately the country and 
the cities were infested with quacks who 
dealt out poison and death with impunity. 
They practiced most murderous methods in 
place of the principles of midwifery. Only 
since the civilized missionaries have pene- 
trated into their country has there been any 
improvement in this condition of affairs. 

It is Greece which furnishes us with the 
most interesting and the most significant re- 
mains of the History of Medicine during an- 
tiquity, as she furnishes every other art with 
the same historical advantages. During the 
period preceding the Trojan war there is little 
but myth and tradition. Leclerc catalogued 
some thirty divinities, heroes or heroines, who 
were supposed to have invented or cultivated 
some of the branches of medicine. Melampus 
is perhaps the first of these who immortalized 
himself by extraordinary cures, especially on 
the daughters of Proetus, King of Argos. 
These young princesses, having taken vows of 
celibacy, became subjects of hysterical mono- 
mania, with delusions, during which they im- 
agined themselves transformed into cows, and 
roamed the forests instead of the palaces. 
This nervous delusion spread to and involved 
many other women, and became a serious 
matter. Melampus, the shepherd, having 
observed the purgative effects upon goats of 
white hellebore, gave to the young women 
milk in which this plant had been steeped, 
thereby speedily effecting a cure. Scarcely 
less distinguished than Melampus was Chiron. 
He was mainly distinguished because he was 
the preceptor of ALsculapius, the most eminent 
of early Greeks in this field. By some ~-Escu- 
lapius was considered the son of Apollo by 
the nymph Coronis. Several cities of Greece 
contended for the honor of his birthplace, as 
they did for that of Homer. That he was 
famous at the time of the Argonautic expedi-

tion is seen by the fact that the twins C 

ami Pollux desired him to accompany the ex- 
pedit irgeon. Be his origin what it 

may. - 1 sculapius was the leading character in 

medicine of all the ancients, with the possible 

tion of Hermes among the Egyptians; 

in fact, some scholars consider the two iden- 
tical. Temples were erected in his honor, 
priests were consecrated to them, and schools 
of instruction were there established. It is 
related that Pluto, god of hell, alarmed at 
the diminishing number of his daily ar- 
rivals, complained to Jupiter, who destroyed 
the audacious healer— on which account, 
some wit has said, "the modern children of 
.Kseulapius abstain from performing prodi- 
gies. - ' Put the true .Ksculapians, the succes- 
sors of the demigod, were imitated or copied 
by the crowd of charlatans and quacks, call- 
ing themselves theosophs, thaumaturgs, and 
so on; and not alone at that date, but for 
generations and centuries thereafter — Para- 
celsus and Mesmer being fair examples of this 
The poet Pindar, who lived seven or 
eight hundred years after .Kseulapius, says 
that he cured ulcers, wounds, fever and pains 
of all who applied to him, by enchantment, 
potions, incisions, and by external applica- 
tions.* 

The followers of /Kseulapius, and the priests 
in the temples dedicated to him, soon formed 
a separate caste, transmitting from one to 
another, as a family heritage, their medical 
knowledge. At first no one was admitted to 
practice the sacred science unless he joined 
the priesthood, although later this secrecy 
was relaxed. They initiated strangers — pro- 
vided they fulfilled the test which they made. 
Some kind of medical instruction was given 
in each temple. The three most celebrated 
temples to .-Kseulapius were: that of Rhodes, 
already extinct by the time of Hippocrates; 
that of ('nidus, which published a small reper- 
tory; and finally that of Cos, most celebrated 
of all because of the illustrious men who 
emanated from this school. In these temples 
votive tablets were fastened in large num- 
bers, after the fashion of the Egyptians, the 
same giving the name of the patient, his 
aftliction, and the manner of his cure. For 
example, such a one as this: " Julien vomited

blood, and appeared lOBl b« -yond reC 

The oracle ordered him to take the pine 

from the altar, which they had three 

mingled with honey; he did so, and was 

cured. Having solemnly thanked the god, he 

went away." There is reason to think that 

the priests of these temples made for their 
own uses much more minute and accurate 
accounts which should be of some real ser- 
vice, since the writings which have come 
down to us evince a habit of close observation 
and clear description of disease. During the 
Trojan war two men are frequently men- 
tioned by Homer as possessing great sui 
skill. These were Machaon and Podalirius. 
They were regarded as sons of Kseulapius, 
the former being the elder. The first ac&lt; ount 
of venesection, although not authentic, refers 
to the bleeding practiced by the latter upon 
the daughter of the King of Caria, upon 
whose shores Podalirius was cast by tempest 
after the ruin of Priam's kingdom. Whether 
he was the first of all men to practice it, or 
not, it is certain that the act of venesection 
goes back long prior to the era of Hippoc- 
rates, who speaks of it as frequently per- 
formed. 

Many of the deities upon Olympus seem at 
one time or another to have usurped medical 
functions. Apollo, the reputed father of . Kseu- 
lapius, appropriated nearly everything under 
the name of Paeon, who assumed the privilege 
of exciting or subduing epidemics. Juno was 
supposed to preside at accouchments, and in 
both the Iliad and Odyssey it is indicated 
that Apollo was considered as the cause of 
all the natural deaths among men, and Diana 
of those among women. 

The long Trojan war appears to have been 
an epoch-making event in the medical and 
surgical history of those times, as was the 
Civil War recently in our own country. Cer- 
tain vague and indefinite practices then took 
more fixed form, and from that time on medi- 
cine may be said to have been furnished 
with a history. After the dethronement of 
Priam and the destruction of his capital. 
navigation was free and unrestricted. The 
Hellenists covered with their colonies both 
shores of the Mediterranean, and their navi- 
gators even passed the pillars of Hercules. By 
these means the worship of /Kseulapius passed 
from Greece into what is now Asia, Africa, 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 



and Italy. In his temple at Epidaurus was 
a statue of colossal size made of gold and 
ivory. The dialogues of Plato, especially the 
Phaedo, make it apparent that the cock was 
the animal sacrificed to him, and hence sacred 
to the god of medicine. I he priests attached 
to his worship were called As/epiadte, or de- 
scendants of /Esculapius. The temples were 
usually hygienically located near thermal 
springs or fountains and among groves. Pil- 
grimages were made from all quarters, and 
these localities became veritable health- 
resorts. A well regulated dietary, pure air, 
temperate habits, and faith stimulated to a 
fanatical degree, combined and sufficed for 
cures which even nowadays would be re- 
garded as wonderful. The priests prescribed 
venesection, purgatives, emetics, friction, sea 
baths, and mineral waters, as they appeared to 
be indicated. The imagination of the patient 
was continually stimulated, and at the same 
time controlled. Before interrogating the 
oracles they must be purified by abstinence, 
prayer, and sacrifice. Sometimes they were 
obliged to lie in the temple for one or more 
nights. The gods sometimes revealed them- 
selves in mysterious ways, at times devour- 
ing the cakes upon the altars under the guise 
of a serpent, or again causing dreams which 
were to be interpreted by the priests. There 
can be no doubt that sometimes, at least, 
the grossest frauds and the basest trickery 
were relied upon for the purpose of impress- 
ing the minds of those weakened by absti- 
nence or influenced by drugs. Mercenary con- 
siderations were not lacking; moreover, cures 
were often not obtained until zeal had been 
redoubled by largely increased contributions 
to the treasury of the temples. In the neigh- 
borhood of many of these temples serpents 
abounded, non-venomous and easily tamed. 
These were employed by the priests in vari- 
ous supernatural performances by which the 
ignorant people were astonished and pro- 
foundly impressed. In fact, the serpent and 
the serpent myth played a very large role in 
the early history of medicine as well as that 
of religion and religious symbolism. 

It will thus be seen that during the space 
of about 700 years medicine underwent a 
transformation in Greece. It was first domes- 
tic and popular, practiced by shepherds, sol- 
diers, and others; then became sacerdotal; 



after the Trojan war it was confined to the 
vicinity of the temples and practiced in the 
name of some divinity; and finally it was 
wrapped in mystery and mystic symbolism 
where superstition was played upon and 
credulity made to pay its reward. Down to 
the time of Hippocrates the Asclepiadae ren- 
dered some genuine service to science, espe- 
cially by inculcating habits of observation, in 
which Hippocrates excelled above all. Later, 
however, down to the time of the Christian 
era, medicine in the temples declined and 
became in fact a system based upon the 
grossest jugglery. 

It is time now that we make a systematic 
attempt to classify events in the history of 
medicine and to recognize certain di&gt;tinct 
epochs as they have occurred. For this pur- 
pose I know of no better arrangement than 
that of Renouard, which, in the main, I shall 
follow, at least during the earlier part of 
these lectures: In this sense he divides the 
past into three ages, known respectively as 
the Age of Foundation, the Age of Tra?isition, 
and the Age of Renovation. Each of these 
chronological divisions is subdivided into 
periods, of which the first contains four: 

Age of Foundation. — 1st. The Primitive 
Period, or that of Instinct; beginning with 
myth, and ending with the destruction of 
Troy 1 184 years before Christ. 

2d. The Sacred or Mystic Period, ending 
with the dispersion of the Pythagorean Soci- 
ety, 500 years before Christ. 

3d. The Philosophic Period, terminating 
with the foundation of the Alexandrian 
library, 320 years before Christ. 

4th. The Anatomic Period, ending with the 
death of Galen, about a.d. 200. 

The Second Age, or that of Transition, 
is divided into a fifth or Greek Period, ending 
at the burning of the Alexandrian library, 
a.d. 640, and a sixth, Arabic Period, ending 
with the revival of letters, a.d. 1400. 

The Third Age, or that of Renovation, 
includes the seventh or Erudite Period, com- 
prising the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, 
and eighth or Reform Period, comprising the 
seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth cen- 
turies. 

Examining this table for a moment, it will 
be seen that so far we have dealt with the 



THK MEDICAL AGE. 



Primitive Period and the Sacred or Mystic 
Period. Before passing on to the Philo- 

d let us for a moment foi 
Renouard, who likens the three - of 

medical belief in the earlier part of the 
Primary Age, or the Age of Foundation, to 
the three schools of cosmogony which ob- 
tained among the ('.reeks. The First of 
these was headed by Pythagoras, who re- 
led the universe as inhabited by acknowl- 
edged sentient principles which governed all 
substances in a determined way for precon- 
ceived purposes Animals, plants, and even 
minerals were supposed to possess vivifying 
spirits, and above them all was a supreme 
principle. To this school corresponded the 
so-called Dogmatic School of medicine, 
attributed to Hippocrates, which was the 
precursor of modern vitalism and regarded 
diseases as indivisible units from beginning 
to termination — in other words, they con- 
sisted of a regular programme of character- 
istic symptoms, successive periods, and of 
long course, either for the better or worse; 
that was one of the characteristic dogmas 
of the Hippocratic teaching. The Second 
System of cosmogony was that founded by 
Leucippus and Democritus, who explained all 
natural phenomena without recourse to the 
intervention of intelligent principles. All 
things for them existed as the necessary re- 
sult of the eternal laws of matter. They 
denied preconceived purposes and ridiculed 
final causes. To this system corresponded 
that in medicine which has been termed 
Methodism (medically and literally speaking) 
and which recognized as its founders /Escula- 
pius and Themison. The believers in this doc- 
trine attempted to apply the atomic theory 
of Democritus and Kpicurus to the theory 
and practice of medicine. Atoms of vari- 
ous size were supposed to pass and repass 
without cessation through cavities or pores in 
the human body. So long as the atoms and 
pores maintained a normal relationship of 
size and proportion, health was maintained, 
but it was deranged so soon as the exactness 
of these relations was destroyed or interfered 
with. The Dogmatists considered vital reac- 
tion as a primary phenomenon, while with the 
Methodists it was secondary. The Third 
System of cosmogony, founded by Parmen- 
ides and Pyrrho, believed in the natural im- 



provement i • in their endless repro- 

duction and change, and concluded that iri 
dom consisted in remaining in doubt; in other 
words, they were the agnostics of that day. 
"What is the Qfl of fatiguing 

the mind in endeavoring to comp:&lt; hat 

IS beyond its capability'" Later they were 
known as Sceptics and /etetics, to indicate 
that they were always in search of truth 
without flattering themselves that they had 
found it. To them corresponded a third class 
of physicians, with Philinus and Serapis at 
their head, who deemed that proximate 
causes and primitive phenomena of disease 
were inaccessible to observation; that all that 
is affirmed on these subjects is purely hypo- 
thetical and hence unworthy of consideration 
in choosing treatment. For them, objective 
symptoms — or, as we would say, signs -con- 
stituted the natural history of disease, they 
thus believing that their remedies could only 
be suggested by experience, since nothing 
else could reveal itself to them. They thus 
took the name of Empirics. 

Finally a fourth class of physicians arose 
who would not adopt any one of these Bj 
terns exclusively, but chose from each what 
seemed to them most reasonable and satis- 
factory. They called themselves Eclat. 
wishing thereby to imply that they made ra- 
tional choice of what seemed best. The idea 
conveyed in the term "eclecticism" has been 
fairly criticised for this reason: eclecticism 
is in reality neither a system nor a theory; it 
is individual pretension elevated to the dig- 
nity of dogma. The true eclectic recognizes 
no other rule than his particular taste, reason, 
or fancy, and two or more eclectics have little 
or nothing in common. If that were true 
2000 years ago, it is not much less so to-day. 
The eclectic carefully avoids the discussion 
of principles, and has neither taste nor capa- 
city for abstract reasoning, although he may 
be a good practitioner; not that he has no 
ideas, but that his ideas form no working 
system. With him medical tact, i. e. culti- 
vated instinct, replaces principle. 

The eclectic of our day, however, is only 
an empiric in disguise — that is, a man whose 
opinions are based on comparison of observed 
facts, but whose theoretical ideas do not go 
beyond phenomena. 

In older days philosophy embraced the

whole of human knowledge, and the philoso- 
pher was not permitted to be unacquainted 
with any of its branches. Now physics, meta- 
physics, natural history, etc., are arranged 
into separate sciences, and the sum total of 
knowledge is too great to be compassed by 
any one man. 

Pythagoras was the last of the Greek sages 
who made use of hieroglyphic writings and 
transmitted his doctrine in ancient language. 
Born at Samos, he was first of all an athlete, 
but one day, hearing a lecture on immortality 
of the soul, he was thereby so strongly at- 
tracted to philosophy that he renounced all 
other occupation to devote himself to it. He 
studied arduously in Eygpt, in Phoenicia, in 
Chaldea, and even, it is said, in India, where 
he was initiated into the secrets of the Brah- 
mins and Magi. Finally returning to his own 
country, he was received by the tyrant 
Polycrates, but not made to feel at home. 
Starting on his travels again, he assisted at one 
of the Olympic games, and being recognized 
was warmly greeted. He sailed to the south 
of Italy, landed at Crotona, and lodged with 
MUo the athlete. Commencing here his lec- 
tures, he soon gathered around him a great 
number of disciples, of whom he required a 
very severe novitiate, lasting even five or six 
years, during which they had to abstain 
almost entirely from conversation and live 
upon a very frugal diet. Those only who 
persevered were initiated later into the mys- 
teries of the order. His disciples had for 
him most profound veneration, and were ac- 
customed to decide all disputes with, " The 
master has said it." Pythagoras possessed 
immense knowledge; he invented the theorem 
of the square of the hypothenuse, and he first 
divided the year into 365 days and 6 hours. 
He seems to have suspected the movements 
of our planetary system. He traveled from 
place to place, and founded schools and com- 
munities wherever he went — which exercised, 
at least at first, only the happiest influence; 
but the success and influence which their 
learning gave them later made his disciples 
bold and then dishonest, and his communities 
were finally dispersed by angry mobs, which 
forced their members to conceal or expatri- 
ate themselves; and so, even during the life- 
time of its founder, the Pythagorean Society 
was destroyed, and never reconstructed. 



With Pythagoras and his disciples, numbers 
played a very important role, and the so- 
called language of numbers was first taught 
by him. He considered the unit as the essen- 
tial principle of all things, and designated 
God by the figure 1, and matter by the figure 
2, and then he expressed the universe by 12 
as representing the juxtaposition of 1 and 2. 
As 12 results from multiplying 3 by 4, he 
conceived the universe as composed of three 
distinct worlds, each of which was developed 
in four concentric spheres, and these spheres 
corresponded to the primitive elements of 
fire, air, earth, and water. The application of 
the number 1 2 to express the universe Pythag- 
oras had received from the Chaldeans and 
Egyptians — it being the origin of the insti- 
tution of the zodiac. — Although this is di- 
gressing, it serves to show what enormous 
importance the people of that time attached 
to numbers, especially to ternary and quater- 
nary periods in the determination of critical 
days in illness. Pythagoras was the founder 
of a philosophic system of great grandeur, 
beauty, and in one sense completion, em- 
bracing as it does, and uniting by common 
bounds, God, the universe, time, and eter- 
nity; furnishing an explanation of all natural 
phenomena, which, if not true, was at that 
time acceptable, and which appears in strong 
and favorable contrast as against the mytho- 
logical systems of pagan priests. No wonder 
that it captivated the imagination and under- 
standing of the thinking young men of that 
day. Had they continued in the original 
purity of life and thought in which he indoc- 
trinated them, there is no knowing how long 
the Pythagorean school might have contin- 
ued. But after it had been dissolved by the 
storm of persecution, its members were scat- 
tered all over Greece and even beyond. Now 
no longer held by any bonds, many of them 
revealed the secrets of their doctrine, to 
which circumstance we owe the little knowl- 
edge thereof we now possess. 

The Pythagoreans apparently first intro- 
duced the custom of visiting patients in their 
own homes, and they went from city to city 
and house to house in performance of this 
duty. On this account they were called 
Periodic or Ambulant physicians, in opposi- 
tion to the Asclepiadre who prescribed only 
in the temples. Empedocles of Agrigentum,

tin, the inhabitants of Selinus were rav- 
aged by epidemic disease. A sluggish stream 
filled the city with stagnant water from which 
mephitic vapors arose. Kmpedocles caused 
two small rivulets to be conducted into it, 
which made its current more rapid; the noxious 
vapors dispersed and the scourge subsided. 

The Gymnasia. — Pcfore we proceed to a 
somewhat more detailed but brief account of 
Hippocrates, it is necessary to say a word or 
two of the ancient gymnasia of Greece which 
were used long before the Asclepiadre had 
practiced or begun to teach. In these gym 
nasia were three orders of physicians — first 
the director, called the Gymnasiarch; second, 
the subdirector, or Gymnast, who directed the 
pharmaceutical treatment of the sick; and 
lastly the Iatroliptes, who put up prescriptions, 
anointed, bled, gave massage, dressed wounds 
and ulcers, reduced dislocations, treated ab- 
scesses, etc. Of the gymnasiarchs wonderful 
stories are told evincing their sagacity, which, 
though somewhat fabulous, indicate the pos- 
session of a very high degree of skill of a cer- 
tain kind. ( )f one of the most celebrated of 
these, Herodicus, we may recall Plato's ac- 
cusation, who reprimanded him severely for 
succeeding too well in prolonging the livesof 
the aged. Whatever else maybe said, we must 
acknowledge that above all others the Greeks 
recognized the value of physical culture in 
the prevention of infirmity, and of all physical 
methods iti the treatment of disease. By 
their wise enactments with reference to these 
matters they set an example which mod- 
ern legislators have rarely if ever been wise 
enough to follow— an example of compulsory 
physical training for the young, — and thereby 
built up a nation of athletes and a people of 
rugged constitution among whom disease was 
almost unknown. 



I come now to tin- so- called PAi/oso 

[ the third period in the Age of 
Foundation, which is inseparably COnn&lt; 
with the name of / ntral 

in the history of ancient medicine 
born on the Island of Cos, of a family in which 
the practice of medicine was hereditary, who 
! their a on the male side to 

lapius and on the females l&lt; I llercu- 
individual to whom every one re- 
fers under this name was the second « if seven : 
the date of his birth goes back to 460 
but of his life and his a^e at death we do not 
know: some say he lived to be over 100 years 
of age. It is certain that he traveled widely, 
since his writings evince the knowledge thus 
gained. He was a contemporary of Socrates, 
although somewhat younger, and lived in 
the age of Pericles, the golden age for sci- 
ence and art in Greece. 

The Island of Cos is now called Stan-Co, 
and is situated net far from the coast of 
Ionia. Formerly it was considered as having 
a most salubrious climate; now that it is under 
the dominion of the Turks it is considered 
most unhealthy. It possessed a temple dedi- 
cated to - -Ksculapius, and a celebrated medical 
school. But Hippocrates, not satisfied with 
what he could learn here, visited the princi- 
pal foreign cities, and seems to have been a 
most accurate and painstaking observer and 
collector of notes. That he achieved great 
renown in his life is known, since Plato and 
even Aristotle refer to him as their authority 
in very many matters. His children and 
grandchildren followed in his footsteps, and 
published their writings under the same name; 
it has therefore become difficult to distinguish 
his works from theirs. Finally authors more 
unscrupulous, who bore no relationship to him, 
attached his name to their own writings. Put 
the true were, as a rule, easily distinguished 
from the spurious, and were carefully sepa- 
rated by those in charge of the Alexandrian 
library. 

The enumeration of his writings by differ- 
ent authors varies very much. Renouard, 
who seems to have studied the subject very 
carefully, gives the following as appearing to 
him to be the authentic list of writings of 
Hippocrates the Second, /. e. the Great: The 
Prognostic, the Aphorisms, the first and third 
books of Epidemics, that concerning Regimen 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 



in Acute Disease, that on Airs, Waters, and 
Places, that on Articulations and Luxations, 
that on Fractures, and the Mochlic, or the 
treatise on instruments and reduction. This 
list does not comprse the fourth part of 
the entire Hippocratic collection, but its au- 
thenticity appears to be undoubted, and it 
suffices, as Renouard says, to justify the en- 
thusiasm of his contemporaries and the admi- 
ration of posterity. Later, joined with the 
writings of Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, and 
others, they constituted the so-called Hippo- 
(ratic collection, which was a definite part of 
the great libraries of Alexandria and Perga- 
mos, and formed the most ancient authentic 
monument of medical science. 

Respect for the bodies of the dead was a 
religious observance in all Greece, and pre- 
vented the dissection of the human body. 
Consequently the knowledge of anatomy 
possessed by Hippocrates must have been 
meagre. Nevertheless he described lesions 
like wounds of the head, of the heart, the 
glands, the nature of bones, etc. It being 
impossible to establish a physiology without 
an anatomical basis, it is not strange that we 
find but little physiology in the Hippocratic 
writings, and that this little is very crude 
and incorrect. Arteries and veins were con- 
founded, and nerves, tendons, ligaments and 
membranes were represented as analogous or 
interchangeable tissues. The physiologists 
of those days abandoned themselves to trans- 
cendental speculation concerning the nature 
and principles of life, which some placed in 
moisture, others in fire, etc. Speculation thus 
run wild prevented such accurate observa- 
tion as might have greatly enhanced the 
progress of physiological knowledge. 

Hippocrates wrote at least three treatises 
concerning hygiene: the first on Airs, Waters, 
and Places; the second on Regimen; the third 
on Salubrious Diet — practically an abridge- 
ment of the preceding, in which he recom- 
mends the habit of taking one or two vomits 
systematically every month. The classifica- 
tion of diseases into internal or medical, and 
external or surgical, is not modern, but is 
due to Hippocrates; neither is it philosophic, 
although it is very convenient. 

With so little knowledge of physiology and 
pathology as the ancients had, it is not strange 
that they ascribed undue importance to exter- 



nal appearance- in other words, to what has 
been termed semei&lt;tics, which occupies a very 
considerable place in the medical treatises of 
the Asclepiadae. Indeed, the writings on this 
subject constitute more than one-eighth part 
of the entire Hippocratic collection. To 
prognosis, also, Hippocrates ascribed' very 
great importance, saying that " The best phy- 
sician is the one who is able to establish 
a prognosis, penetrating and exposing first of 
all, at the bed-side, the present, the past, and 
the future of his patients, and adding what 
they omit in their statements. He gains their 
confidence, and being convinced of his supe- 
riority of knowledge they do net hesitate to 
commit themselves entirely into his hands. 
He can treat, also, so much better their pres- 
ent condition in proportion as he shall be 
able from it to foresee the future," etc. 

To the careful scrutiny of facial appear- 
ances, the position, and other body marks 
about the patient, he attributed very great 
importance; in fact, so positive was he about 
these matters that he embodied the principal 
rules of semeiotics into aphorisms, to which, 
however, there came later so many excep- 
tions that they lost much of their value. 
From certain passages in his book on Predic- 
tion, and from the book on Treatment which 
is a part of the Hippocratic collection, it ap- 
pears that it was the custom then of physi- 
cians to announce the probable issue of the 
disease upon the first or second visit — a cus- 
tom which still prevails in China and in Tur- 
key. It gave the medical man the dignity of 
an oracle when right, but left him in a very 
awkward position when wrong. 

To Hippocrates we are indebted for the 
classification of sporadic, epidemic, and en- 
demic forms, as well as for the division of 
disease into acute and chronic. Hippocrates 
wrote extensively on internal disease, includ- 
ing some particular forms of it such as epi- 
lepsy, which was called the sacred disease; 
also fragnen's on diseases of girls, relating 
particularly to hysteria; also a book on the 
nature of woman, an extensive treatise on 
diseases of women, and a monograph on 
sterility. That Hippocrates was a remark- 
ably close observer of disease as it appeared 
to him, his books amply prove; in fact, they 
almost make one think that close observation 
is one of the lost arts; being open only to the

objection that too much weight was attached 
to insignificant external appearances, specu- 
lation on which detracted from consideration 

of the serious feature of the - Hifl thera- 
peutics, considering the crude information of 
the time, was a vast improvement on that 
which had pr&lt; tnd really entitled him 

to his titl( at Physician. 

Of external diseases ami their si;:, 
therapeutics he wrote fully: on The Labora- 
tory ^i t': m, dealing with dressings, 
bandaging, and operating; on Fractures; and 
on Articulations and Dislocations; showing 
much more anatomical knowledge than was 
possessed by his contemporaries. The Moch- 
lic was an abridgement of former treatises; in 
Wounds of the Head, he formulated the dic- 
tum co icerning the possible danger of trilling 
wounds and the possible recovery from those 
most serious, so often ascribed to Sir Astley 
Cooper. Other monographs, also, he wrote, 
on 1 I f the Eye, on Fistula, and on 
Haemorrhoids. He described only a small 
number of operations, however, and all the 
Hippocratic writings on surgery would make 
but a very incomplete treatise as compared 
with those that belong to the next historical 
epoch; all of which we have to ascribe — in 
the main — to prejudice against dissection, 
and ignorance of anatomy. 

From the earliest times physicians and 
writers occupied themselves largely with ob- 
stetrics, as was most natural. The Hippo- 
cratic collection includes monographs on 
Generation; the Nature of the Infant; the 
Seventh Month of Pregnancy; the Eighth 
Month of Pregnancy; on Accouchment; on 
Superfcetation; on Dentition; on Diseases of 
Women; on the Extraction of the Dead 
Fcctus. The treatise on superfcetation con- 
cerned itself mainly with obstetrics. 

On epidemics Hippocrates writes exten- 
sively, showing that he had studied them 
carefully. He was among the first to con- 
nect meteorological phenomena with those 
of disease during given seasons of the year, 
expressing the hope that by the study of 
storms it would be possible to foresee the 
advent of the latter and prepare for them. 
Seven books of the Hippocratic collection 
bear the title of Epidemics, although only 
two of them are exclusively devoted to this 
subject. In these books were contained a 



list of clinical observations relating to 
various dil They constituted really a 

clinical study of disease. 

The collection of Hippocrates' Aphorisms 
fills seven of the books; no medical work of 
antiquity can compare with these. Physi- 
cians and philosophers of many centuries have 
professed for them the same veneration as 
the Pythagoreans manifested for their golden 
I hey were considered the crowning 
glory of the collection. Even within a short 
time past the Faculty of Paris required aspir- 
ants for the medical degree to insert a certain 
number of these in their theses, and only the 
political revolution of France served to cause 
a discontinuance of this custom. These aphor- 
isms formed, says Littre, "a succession of 
propositions in juxtaposition, but not united." 
It has always been and always will be disad- 
vantageous for a work to be written in that 
style, since such aphorisms lose all their gen- 
eral significance; and that which seem- 
lated in itself becomes more so when intro- 
duced into modern science with which it has 
but little practical relationship. Put not so 
if the mind conceives of the ideas which pre- 
vailed when these aphorisms were written; 
in this light, when they seem most disjoined 
they are most related to a common doctrine by 
which they are united, and in this view they 
no longer appear as detached sentences. 

The school of the Asclepiadae has been re- 
sponsible for certain theories which have been 
more or less prominent during the earlier 
historical days. One of these which prevailed 
throughout the Hippocratic works is that of 
Coction and Crisis. By the former term is 
meant thickening or elaboration of humors 
in the body, which was supposed to be neces- 
sary for their elimination in some tangible 
form. Disease was regarded as an associa- 
tion of phenomena resulting from efforts 
made by the conservative principles of life to 
effect a coction, i.e. a combination, of the 
morbific matter in the economy, it being rueld 
that the latter could not be properly expelled 
until thus united and prepared so as to form 
excrementitious material This elaboration 
was supposed to be brought about by the vital 
principles which some called nature {PJiysis), 
some spirit {Psyche), some breath (Pneuma) t 
and some heat (Thcrmon). The gradual cli- 
max of morbid phenomena has, since the days

of Hippocrates, been commonly known as 
Crisis; it was regarded as the announce- 
ment of the completion of the union by coc- 
tion. The day on which it was accomplished 
was termed critical, as were also the signs 
which preceded or accompanied it, and for 
the crisis the physician anxiously watched. 
Coction having been effected and crisis oc- 
curring, it only remained to evacuate the 
morbific material — which nature sometimes 
spontaneously accomplished by the critical 
sweat, urination, or stools, or sometimes the 
physician had to come to her relief by the ad- 
ministration of diuretics, purgatives, etc. The 
term " critical period " was given to the num- 
ber of days necessary for coction, which in its 
perfection was supposed to be four, the so- 
called quaternary, while the septenary was 
also held in high consideration. Combination 
of figures after the Pythagorean fashion pro- 
duced many complicated periods, however, 
and so periods of 34, 40 and 60 days were 
common. This doctrine of crisis in disease 
left an impress upon the medical mind not 
yet fully eliminated. Celsus was the most 
illustrious of its adherents, but it can be rec- 
ognized plainly in the teachings of Galen, 
Sydenham, Stahl, Van Swieten, and many 
others. In explanation it must be said that 
there have always existed diseases of nearly 
constant periods, these being nearly all of 
the infectious form, and that the whole "crit- 
ical " doctrine is founded upon the recogni- 
tion of this natural phenomenon. 

The Hippocratic books are full, also, of 
the four elements, earth, water, air, and fire; 
four elementary qualities, namely, heat, cold, 
dryness, and moisture; and the four cardinal 
humors, blood, bile, atrabile, and phlegm. 

Owing to the poverty of knowledge of 
physics and chemistry possessed by the an- 
cients, and notwithstanding their errors and 
imperfections, the doctrine of Dogmatism, 
founded upon the theory of coction and hu- 
mors, was the most intelligible and complete 
among the medical doctrines of antiquity, re- 
sponding better, as it did, to the demands of 
the science of that day. That Hippocrates 
was a profound observer is shown in this, 
that he reminds both philosophers and physi- 
cians that the nature of man cannot be well 
known without the aid of medical observa- 
tion, and that nothing should be affirmed 



concerning that nature until by our senses 
we have become certain of it. In this maxim 
he took position opposed to the Pythagorean 
doctrine, and included therein the ,germ of 
a new philosophy of which Plato miscon- 
ceived and of which Aristotle, had a very 
faint glimpse. 

Another prominent theory throughout the 
Hippocratic books is that of Fluxions, mean- 
ing thereby about what we would call con- 
gestions, or conditions which we would say 
were ordinarily caused by cold, though cer- 
tain fluxions were supposed to be caused by 
heat because the tissues thereby became 
rarefied, their pores enlarged, and their humor 
attenuated so that it flowed easily when com- 
pressed. The whole theory of fluxion was 
founded on the densest ignorance of tissues 
and the laws of physics; the body of man 
being sometimes likened to a sponge and 
sometimes to a sieve. The treatment recom- 
mended was almost as crazy as the theory. 
Certain other theories have complicated or 
disfigured the Hippocratic writings, and cer- 
tain have been founded on the consideration 
of two elements, i. e. fire and earth, or on the 
consideration of one single element which 
was supposed to be air, the breath, or pneuma; 
and there was — lastly — the theory of any ex- 
cedent, which is very vague; of all of these we 
may say that they are not of sufficient inter- 
est to demand expenditure of our time. 

The eclat which the second, i.e. the Great, 
Hippocrates gave to the school of Asclepiadae 
in the Island of Cos long survived, and many 
members of his family followed in his foot- 
steps. Among his most prominent successors 
were Polybius, Diodes, and Praxagoras, also 
of Cos, the last of the Asclepiadse mentioned 
in history. Praxagoras was distinguished 
principally for his anatomical knowledge; like 
Aristotle he supposed that the veins originated 
from the heart, but did not confound those 
vessels with the arteries as his predecessors 
had done, but supposed that they contained 
only air, or the vital spirit. It has been 
claimed that he dissected the human body. 
He laid the foundation of sphygmology, or 
study of the pulse, since Hippocratic writers 
rarely alluded to arterial pulsations and de- 
scribed them as of only secondary importance. 

The predominating theory in the Island of 
Cos was that which made health dependent

on th&lt; tn and play of tl 

ments of the body ami on perfect combina- 
tion of the four cardinal humors. iTh 
the prevailing doctrine, i.e. the Am iei I \l- ! 
aatism, so named b&gt; I em- 

braced the most profound dogmas in medi- 
cine and was taught exclusively until the 
foundation of the school at Alexandria. 

Two men, however, more commonly ranked 
among philosophers than among physicians 

Of antiquity, dissected the statements of Hip- 
pocrates, and embodied them more or l&lt; 
their own teachings, and thus exercised a 
great influence on the progress of the human 
mind, particularly in the direction of medical 
study. The first of these was Plato, pro- 
found moralist, eloquent writer, and most 
versatile thinker of his day or ,any other. 
He undertook the study of disease not by 
observation (the empirical or experimental 
method), but by pure intuition. He seemed 
to have never discovered that his meditations 
were taken in the wrong direction, and that 
the method did not conduce to the discovery 
of abstract truths. He gave beauty an ab- 
stract existence, and affirmed that all things 
beautiful are beautiful because of the pres- 
ence of beauty. This reminds one of that 
famous response in the school of the Middle 
Ages to a question, " Why does opium produce 
sleep?" the answer being, "Because it pos- 
sesses the sleepy principle." Plato intro- 
duced into natural science a doctrine of final 
causes. He borrowed from Pythagoras the 
dogma of homogeneity of matter, and claimed 
that it had a triangular form. 

Aristotle, equally great thinker with 
Plato, but whose mental activity was manifest 
in other channels, was born in Stagyrus, in 
Macedonia. He was fascinated by the teach- 
ings of Plato, and attained such eminence as 
a student that King Philip of Macedon made 
him preceptor to his son Alexander, subse- 
quently the Great; by whom he was later 
furnished with sufficient funds to form the 
first known museum in natural history, a col- 
lection of rare objects of every sort, trans- 
mitted, many of them, by the royal hands of 
his former student from the remote depths 
of Asia. Aristotle, by long odds the greatest 
naturalist of antiquity, laid the first philo- 
sophic basis for empiricism. He admitted four 
elements, fire, air, earth, and water, and be- 



mutual transmuta- 
tion. He studied the nature of the soul, and 
that of the animal body; at and 

as two conditions indispensable to 
tin with some ace 

but without the l&lt; i of its true func- 

tion; said that the nei \ 1 from the 

heart; termed the aorta a ner :i, and 

made various other mistakes which to us 
seem inexcusable. Nevertheless he was rich 
with many merits, and no one of h: 
studied or searched more things than he, nor 
introduced so many new facts. Although he 
never dissected human bodies, he neverthe- 
less corrected errors in anatomy held to by 
the Hippocratic school. He dissected a large 
number of animals of every sp&lt; 
noted the varieties of size and shape of hearts 
of various animals and birds. In other words, 
he created a comparative anatomy and physi- 
ology, and the plan that he traced was so 
complete that 2000 years later the great 
French naturalist Cuvier followed it (mite 
closely. If he be charged with having prop- 
agated a taste for scholastic subtletu 
also furnished an example of patient and at- 
tentive observation of nature. His history 
of animals is a storehouse of knowledge, and 
his disciples cultivated with zeal anatomy, 
physiology, and natural history. His succes- 
sor, Theophrastus, was the most eminent bot- 
anist of antiquity. 

It will thus be seen that Plato and Aristotle 
were the eminent propagators of two an- 
tagonistic opinions. One supposed knowl- 
edge to be derived by mental intuition, and 
the other that all ideas are due to sensation. 
Both count amongst moderns some partisans 
of the greatest acumen: Descartes, Leibnitz 
and Kant being followers of Plato, and Bacon, 
Locke, Hume, and Condillac, of Aristotle. 

The excuse for stating these things, which 
apparently do not so closely concern the his- 
tory of medicine, must be that of the learned 
interpreter of the doctrine of Cuvier, that 
"The first question in science is always a 
question of method." 

Hippocrates formed a transition between a 
period of mythology and that of history. 
His doctrine was received by contemporaries 
and by posterity with veneration akin to wor- 
ship. No other man ever obtained homage 
so elevated, constant, and universal. A little 



later ignorance reigned in the school that he 
made celebrated. Methods and theories were 
propagated there under the shadow of his 
name which he would have disowned. 

Medical science now changes its habitation 
as well as its aspect, and from the record of 
Hippocrates and his work we turn to the 
fourth period of the Age of Foundation, 
namely the Anatomic, which extends from the 
foundation of the Alexandrian library, 320 
b. c, up to the death of Galen about the 
year a. d. 200.

INDIAN REMITTENT FEVER. 

BY N. C. MITRA, M.A., M.B. 

Remittent fevef, not malarial in origin, is 
a malady more or less peculiar to India. It 
does not find place in current text-books, 
hence may be presumed not to exist in 
Europe or America; and for this reason I 
venture to enter upon a somewhat elaborate 
description, particularly as it does not come 
under the category of continued fevers, which 
are characterized by definite eruptions and 
local lesions. 

So far as aetiology is concerned, scarcely 
anything has as yet come to light. Many 
are of opinion that it is of specific origin, and 
this opinion gains ground from the fact the 
malady is marked by a definite periodicity, 
and quinine fails to produce the least impres- 
sion upon its course. 

This form of fever presents itself in four 
varieties, viz.: Simple: Adynamic or low: 
Irritative abdominal or typho-remittent: and 
Malignant with symptoms of simple remittent. 
There is no premonitory rigor or chilliness; 
the patient feels uneasy one afternoon and is 
restless at night; at the same time the skin is 
hot and dry to touch, there is always some 
headache and thirst, the pulse is full and 
bounding— 120 to 130 per minute, — tongue 
dry and furred, bowels generally constipated 
from the beginning, urine high-colored, morn- 
ing temperature generally 102 to 103 F., 
evening temperature gradually rising to a 
maximum of io4°-io5°, or even 106 — even- 
ing exacerbation is never ushered in with a 
rigor. The higher the temperature, the more 
restless the patient becomes, especially at 
night, and there may be delirium. 



As the fever progresses, there is gradual 
prostration and loss of strength; bronchitis 
of a mild form supervenes, while more rarely 
toward the close of the disease pneumonia 
develops as the sequel of hypostatic conges- 
tion. There may be occasional looseness of 
the bowels from irritation in the intestinal 
canal. Some, especially children, feel ten- 
derness on deep pressure in the right hypo- 
chondriac region, no doubt due to temporary 
congestion of the liver induced by the high 
temperature and which is more apparent in 
the later stages. The temperature maintains 
its maximum and minimum heights up to the 
third week, when it goes down by crisis or 
lysis. Sometimes, as the days wear away, the 
patient becomes much weaker and loses flesh 
considerably; the tongue becomes dry, lips 
covered with sordes; pulse small and soft; 
there is picking of bed-clothes; and mutter- 
ing delirium may be present — symptoms of 
the failure of the nervous and circulatory 
systems. 

In the adynamic or low form, the evening 
temperature is between 102 and 103 , while 
that of the morning rarely exceeds 10 1°. 
From the beginning there are low nervous 
symptoms, and within forty-eight hours the 
patient is delirious at night — the delirium, at 
first of a noisy character, very shortly merging 
into a muttering one; when questions are put 
he answers, but if left to himself mutters some- 
thing which has no connection with the sub- 
ject in question; and sometimes, in the midst 
of rational conversation, incoherent words 
are interpolated. As the disease progresses, 
he sinks into such a state of apathy that 
nothing can be elicited even when he is loudly 
spoken to; he seems to be in his full senses, 
but dead to the outer world. — I have seen pa- 
tients staring me full in the face, but keeping 
dead silence when questioned. Ofttimes the 
eyes are closed, at others half-closed in a 
state of coma vigil. The pulse small, quick, 
and compressible. The extremities in many 
are cold while the internal temperature may 
be at 102 , and this is often a cause for 
anxiety as being premonitory of collapse; 
but such is not always the case, since it may 
arise from a defective circulation, consequent 
upon capillary stasis leading to imperfect 
oxydation and generation of heat. The pupils 
are always dilated; tongue dry and coated;

bowels constipated. Gradually sa 4 con- 
sciousness develops, and emls in coma. All 

toms point to the failure of the 
circulatory system to keep up steady ft 
the blood in the arterioles, whence is set up a 
[ -tion of the blood-ve&gt;- 
■f the brain that, if not relic". 
:he nervous system, with resultant coma 
that closes the scene. 

Irritative abdominal or typho-remittent re- 
sembles the simple remittent in all respects 
excepting that early in the attack are ob- 
served evidences of irritation in the intestinal 
developing acute inflammatory diar- 
much is this true that it may be 
confounded with typhoid fever, and many 
practitioners accept it as truly such. It is for 
this reason, too, that the name of typhoid- 
remittent obtains. There is no pain or gurg- 
ling, but there is manifest tenderness over the 
whole abdomen, though nowhere distinctly 
localized. The stools, often watery, may 
have a peculiar smell, are yellowish or green- 
ish in color, but induce no griping or tenes 
mils; they are passed in bed-clothes without 
knowledge of the patient. There is tympa- 
nites, the intestines becoming distended with 
gas to such an extent as to interfere with 
free respiration, which distention goes down 
with a profuse watery stool, only to speedily 
re-accumulate; thus the patient is subjected 
to the two extremes of diarrhoea and dis- 
tended abdomen. This constant drain of 
fluids from the system tells upon the vital 
powers, and, if the high temperature and diar- 
rhoea are not kept within proper control, may 
hasten fatal termination. 

Malignant remittent is now but rarely 
seen. Here the fever is always of a low 
type, and the patient loses strength and flesh 
in a very short time. In a few days there are 
signs of collapse; the pulse small and flutter- 
ing; the tongue dry, fissured or cracked, and 
black; the stools bloody and loose; vomited 
matters sanguineous in character; petechia: 
are seen all over the body; and there may be 
jaundice as well. These cases, almost with- 
out exception, are fatal. There is another 
form of this class which, though not charac- 
terized by such ominous signs, is nevertheless 
not a whit less unfortunate in termination, 
patients succumbing in from thirty-six to 
seventy-two hours. 



During the autumn of 1894 I encounte 
few of tha and it may be mentioned 

that in this locality epidemic cholera prevails 
fourth year, in the months of June, 
July, and August. An epidemic was antici- 
pated this year, but did not appear; our joy, 
however, was not unalloyed, since in its place 
appeared a wave- &lt;&gt;f -astro intestinal disorders 
including sporadic and isolate of re- 

mittent fever of malignant tendency; these 
latter were so early fatal as to lead many to 
believe them new and hitherto unknown de- 
velopments of the cholera poison, hence they 
were often grouped under the designation of 
cholera fever, a name quite new to science. 
But whatever appellation be applied, there is 
not the least doubt of malignancy. Within 
twelve hours of the attack the patient be- 
came delirious; a few hours later he was 
semi-conscious, and before twenty-four hours 
had elapsed he sank into a state of profound 
coma from which he could not be aroused, 
and that gradually terminated in death. Thus 
Indian remittent fever comes on insidiously, 
so that patients are off their guard and no 
attention paid thereto until serious symptoms 
supervene. From the commencement of de- 
lirium to the fatal issue, the malady runs its 
course from bad to worse heedless of any 
measures looking to restraint, and it is quite 
patent that it is of a type distinct from ordi- 
nary remittent. Sometimes delirium may 
continue for forty-eight hours; meantime the 
pulse is smali and thready, the tongue dry, 
the pupil dilated, eyes half-closed, and the 
sufferer wholly apathetic. The delirium then 
gives way to a state of semi-consciousness, 
when there is cold clammy perspiration, and 
deglutition becomes difficult; gradually the 
pulse becomes imperceptible at the wrist, the 
extremities icy cold, the breathing sterterous, 
and death closes the scene. 

Among complications and sequelae pecu- 
liar to all forms of Indian remittent, are af- 
fections of the respiratory organs, such as 
bronchitis, pneumonia, or pleurisy. Diarrhoea 
and dysentery, congestion of the liver, enter- 
itis, inflammation of the auditory passage 
ending in chronic otorrhcea, parotitis, ab- 
scesses, or a general state of ill-health, are 
among the rest. 

The marked peculiarity of the malady lies 
in its duration and termination. Few cases

ever recover under twenty-one days, and so 
nearly universal is this fact that in Calcutta 
Indian remittent fever obtains the popular 
designation of " three-weeks fever;" and yet 
it may end in one or two weeks, or may even 
be prolonged to fifty or sixty days. In nearly 
all cases also the temperature persistently re- 
mains elevated until the eighteenth or nine- 
teenth day, and I have observed as high as 
105 at the end of the fifth week. It may 
terminate through crisis — with profuse per- 
spiration or diarrhoea — but the ending, as be- 
fore remarked, is more commonly by fysis, 
the morning remission continuing longer, and 
the evening exacerbation being late and for 
a shorter period. Recovery is the rule in the 
milder forms, but when the patient is of a 
debilitated constitution or broken down, even 
here fatality is not uncommon. 

Mistakes are often made in diagnosis. 
Early diarrhoea may lead to confounding 
with typhoid fever, but the pain and gurgling 
in the right iliac region, the characteristic 
color and consistence of the stools, and the 
eruptions, if present, afford landmarks un- 
mistakable. Indian remittent may be distin- 
guished from malarial remittent by the fact 
the latter is always preceded by a feeling of 
coldness or shivering; that the case comes 
from a malarial district, and is amenable to 
the influence of quinine. It is quite possible 
that some of the typho-remittent cases are 
masked types of true typhoid, but in the absence 
of characteristic symptoms they cannot well 
be classed as such; often only the post-mortem 
table reveals the true character. 

The chief indications of danger are: Ex- 
cessive diarrhoea; low muttering delirium; 
pneumonia or extensive bronchitis. The 
prognosis is bad in cases already broken 
down in health, in old people and infants, 
and in the malignant forms; and when the 
latter convalesce, relapses are very frequent. 
Treatment requires to be varied somewhat 
in accordance with the exigencies of the in- 
dividual case. The patient should be kept 
in an airy room, the bed so arranged as to 
avoid possible draught and the vicinity of 
underground drains or sewers; bright light 
should be excluded from the eyes of the suf- 
ferer, and he must also be preserved from the 
visits and mistaken kindnesses of friends — the 
great pests of the sick-room in India. When 



diarrhoea manifests itself, the bed-pan should 
be employed and the dejections at once re- 
moved and disinfected; the urinal also should 
be brought into use in like manner. 

No special treatment can be advocated, 
since it must necessarily be symptomatic. 
The most important point is to look to the 
temperature; as the nervous system seriously 
suffers from prolonged exposure, always look 
to the lowering of the temperature as soon as 
it rises above 103 . Warm baths and spong- 
ing are often held highly objectionable by 
natives, and indeed are impracticable in many 
cases. The antipyretic most in favor and 
least pernicious, in my experience, is Lacto- 
phenin. Eight grains will induce perspira- 
tion as often as the temperature rises above 
103 , and its effect persists for at least six 
hours; the delirium which accompanies high 
temperature passes away, the patient secures 
calm and refreshing sleep, and in two hours 
is bathed in profuse moisture. If the bowels 
are constipated, a saline draught may be or- 
dered, but should not be frequently repeated 
as salines tend to weaken. An ordinary dia- 
phoretic mixture of spirit mindererus, or sweet 
spirit of nitre, with tincture of aconite, is best 
to begin with, and should be continued as 
long as there is any indication therefor. 

If the patient complains of sleeplessness at 
night, bromide maybe prescribed with chloral. 
If headache is very severe, and bromide with 
lactophenin does not diminish it, a cantharidal 
plaster on each temple usually acts charm- 
ingly. If there is diarrhoea from the begin- 
ning, the stools should be carefully examined 
for any indication of irritation in the bowels; 
moderate diarrhoea need not be interfered 
with. Bronchitis is to be treated on general 
principles by fomentation and expectorants. 
Towards the later stage of the disease stimu- 
lants should be prescribed as soon as any 
symptoms of cardiac failure supervene, as in- 
dicated by softness and frequency of pulse. 
If there is threatened inflammation of lungs, 
applications of liniment of cajeput oil and 
ammonia, followed by moist fomentations, or 
linseed-meal poultice every three hours, will 
usually avert. Special care should be taken 
in adynamic remittent in which there are evi- 
dences of failure of nervous and circulatory 
systems. Here a fly blister to the nape of 
the neck or back of the ears is of benefit;

at the same time the boweH i be thor- 

by means ol 

if HO ap and water. 

Then begin treatment with spirits, musk, ami 
diffusible stimulants, administered every hour 
or half- hour as circumstances may dictate. 
As the extremities are invariably cold, apply 
ginger-powder frictions over the fingers and 
In worst cases as much as four or five 
ounces of sp : nt may be given with impunity 
and decided advantage, during the first 
twenty-four hours; or it may be mixed with 
meat ext; 

In the case of typho- remittent the only treat- 
ment in addition to the foregoing, that is 
worthy of special mention, is the application 
of glycerin and belladonna extract over the 
abdomen, in turn covering with linseed-meal 
poultice every three hours. As astringents 
are all apt to irritate the bowels, the. 
best avoided; but bismuth in ten-grain doses 
is excellent when there is irritative diarrhoea. 

In malignant forms, a sinapism over the 
precordial region and constant recourse to 
stimulants are to be recommended as early as 
possible, to which digitalis should be added. 
The treatment advocated by many, of admin- 
istering quinine as soon as the temperature 
has been brought down to normal, is quite 
futile in Indian remittent fever, which has a 
fixed duration of its own; as well might one 
try to cut short an attack of typhoid in the 
same manner. 

During convalescence the patient should 
be put upon tonics, such as quinine and iron. 
As relapses are very common, great care 
should be taken as to the diet, which ought 
to be nutritious and easily assimilated, mean- 
ti ne keeping the bowels open by mild aperi- 
ents when necessary. That all forms of expo- 
sure should be avoided, goes without saying.

SERUM THERAPY AGAIN. 

A reaction against the unmeasured claim 
advanced for the curative effects of antitoxin 

appears to be setting in, and the most signifi- 
cant utterance in this respect was recently 
made at a meeting of the Berlin Medical 
Society when Doctor Hansemann, an assist- 
ant in Professor Virchow's pathological insti- 
tute, as mouth-piece of Virchow himself, 
shaiply criticised in detail serum therapeu- 
tics. 

Doctor Harsemann denies that the serum 
immunizes; declares that no sufficient proof 
has been produced respecting its curative 
properties; and adds that the statistics ob- 
tainable of results accruing to the tieatment 
are "both unreliable and misleading." 

Giving judicial attention to statistics that 
have been published, they certainly appear 
to corroborate the charges of Doctor Hanse- 
mann. For instance, the reports of H bring, 
Kossel, Ehrlich, Wassermann, katx, W'eilger, 
Aronson, and Roux, as summarized by La 
Midecine Moderne, admit a mortality of 24 per 
cent.— Roux's admissions in the British Med- 
ical Journal place the mortality at 0.3 per 
cent, higher. In the Hopital des Enfant* 
the mortality is said to have fallen from 73 to 
49 per cent.; and at the same time it is 
Claimed that the fatality in the Trou 
1 [ospital, where the serum was not used, rose 
to 86 per cent. 

katx states the diphtheria mortality in 
two of the chief hospitals in Berlin from 
[892 to 1894 to have averaged 4Q-,^ ) I )er 
cent., but during two months of the latter

year, when one hundred and twenty eight 
cases diagnosed by the presence of Klebs- 
Loeffler bacilli, were treated by means of the 
antitoxin, the mortality was 26.5 per cent.; 
it is also admitted that of forty two severe 
cases nearly 24 per cent, died, while all truly 
septic cases likewise succumbed. There are 
no other statistics than these cited available, 
although there are numerous reports of iso- 
lated cases of one, two, three and four in 
number. 

Per contra, it must be remembered that the 
statistics of Leseure, of the Oram Hospital, 
show he had no deaths from diphtheria while 
employing a forty-per-cent. solution of chro- 
mic acid; that in like manner Goubeau lost 
no cases under a treatment with corrosive 
sublimate and glycerin; Flatraut was equally 
successful with petroleum; and a late Parisian 
medical journal publishes a table of 427 
cases with a mortality of only eight per 
cent, and no antitoxin employed. Again, 
Roux admits all his cases were treated locally 
by Labarraque's solution, hence may be pro- 
pounded the pertinent query: Why, if anti- 
toxin is a specific, is it necessary to resort to 
the knife and to local and constitutional 
treatment? 

It has been well said that " statistics is a 
mistress who prostitutes herself to the first 
comer," and in no way is this more evident 
than from the fact that reports of two or 
three cases, whether positive or negative in 
results, afford no criterion for judgment. It 
frequently happens that a few cases coming 
under the notice of one physician readily re- 
cover, while the same number in equally 
skillful hands in another locality succumb. 
We can therefore only form judgment upon 
the larger number of cases— those which are 
summarized by La Me'decine Moderne, which 
amount all told to 1,081, with, as already re- 
marked, an average mortality of twenty-four 
per cent. 

It is well known that in every epidemic 
the mortality is greater at the time'of incep- 
tion than during the period preceding its dis- 
appearance — that in the beginning a larger 
proportion die, while toward culmination by 
far the larger percentage recover. Statistics 
derived from a few isolated hospitals, and 
extending over a few brief weeks, can afford 
no trustworthy means for comparison, and 



notably the hygienic surroundings in different 
institutions are most variable. Finally, the 
ravages of diphtheria in Detroit, St. Louis, 
Chicago, and New York, at one precise period, 
give no idea of the virulence of epidemics 
during the same period in Portland, New 
Orleans, San Francisco, and St. Paul. At 
best, to derive any definite satisfaction from 
statistics, such must needs cover a period of 
many months and the manifestations of a 
number of epidemics. 

A query put to a number of physicians in 
Michigan, Ohio, and Ontario, as to the death- 
rate from diphtheria in any precise locality — 
not in individual practice, but embracing the 
experience of all the physicians of the neigh- 
borhood — reveals that no one considers that, 
even in the most serious of diphtheria epi- 
demics, the average fatality ever reaches 
twenty per cent.; indeed, the consensus of 
opinion is that it varies from eight to fourteen 
percent., a proportion that is upheld by our 
own experience and observation. 

An examination of the reports of the 
State Board of Health of Michigan fails to 
reveal any such formidable percentage of 
fatalities as are credited with accruing to 
antitoxin treatment; moreover, a communi- 
cation addressed to the Secretary of the 
State Board elicits the opinion that the ex- 
treme of the death-rate from diphtheria has 
never during twenty years reached twenty- 
four per cent. 

In 1883, Mr. George S. Davis, of Detroit, 
published a work entitled "A Collective In- 
vestigation of Diphtheria," which embodies 
the observations of upwards of one hundred 
physicians in all parts of Canada and the 
United States — from Ontario to Texas and 
from Nova Scotia to California, — and careful 
examination of these in detail fails in a single 
instance to reveal any evidence that would 
favor the belief that diphtheria, under all 
forms and methods of treatment, ever yields 
a death-rate of twenty-four per cent. 

Under such circumstances we believe it 
incumbent upon us to say that diphtheria 
in Europe is much more virulent than in the 
United States — which has not been borne 
out by personal observations, — or else the 
claims advanced for " serum therapy " re- 
quire more careful sifting as to statistics,

and meantime the results deserve to be re- 
ceived with B due proportion of rare. 

It is claimed by advocates of the anti- 
toxin treatment that the presence of the 
KJebs-Locffler bacillus is conclusive, and yet 
the same pathologists have admitted that this 
bacillus as well as the pneumococcus, strep- 
tococcus, and other so-called specific mi- 
crobes, may be present when the diseases to 
which they are said to give rise are not 
pending — in other words, under the old 
methods of diagnosis diphtheria only was 
diphtheria ami its statistics of value, while 
now every person, even in health, who har- 
bors the bacillus of Loeffler, must per force 
be suffering from the malady and go to swell 
the statistics of "cures'* Considering these 
facts, there appears good ground for the 
theory advanced that a due share of the 
cures claimed for antitoxin are the out- 
come of recovery from mild diphtheria and 
tonsillitis, while the more severe cases still 
remain in the column of fatalities. An- 
other matter is pertinent in this connection. 
It is only within a few hours that we saw a 
report in a medical journal of the "cure" of 
four cases of "unmistakable diphtheria," 
which from the description must have been 
nearly in articulo mortis, by an agent which 
chemical examination has proved to be utterly 
inert as a therapeutic agent. 

It may here be said that the asseition made 
regarding antitoxin, that it is innocuous, is 
not borne out by facts; indeed, if it is pos- 
sessed of any virtue, it must likewise be po- 
tent for ill, since it is a well known fact that 
any agent having real therapeutic value will 
fulfill the dual conditions. 

Another drawback to the claims advanced 
is, that serum therapy controverts the very 
pathology that its supporters have for so 
many years been laboring to promote, viz., 
that diphtheria is a local disease with sec- 
ondary constitutional manifestations — and 
consequently not a constitutional or general 
malady per sc; and yet those who have held 
to the latter contention, and believe it is the 
local manifestation that is secondary, and 
have based their therapeutics on this belief, 
in our experience have had occasion to record 
the fewest fatalities. 

Reverting now to the obverse of the situa- 
tion, it must be admitted that the evidence as 



regards the vair.e of ^enim therapy in its 
application to individual and isolated &lt; 

seems to be most positive Result! 

reported from New \ ork, Philadelphia, and 
other large cities, most circumstantial in char- 
acter; and the verdict in England, as the re- 
sult of a f eight hundred 

emphatically favorable to antitoxin, though 
all the "returns" have not been duly sifted. 
It is even stated that the demand in Germany 
is far greater than the supply, and that the 
iemedy has been tried in London hospitals to 
a considerable extent with no apparent dimi- 
nution in favorable results. The disappoint- 
ments that have ensued may be the result of 
carelessness, of mistaken zeal, or hasty and 
immature judgment. To be successful, it is 
understood, the treatment must be carried 
out with the strictest of antiseptic precau- 
tions—everything employed must be care- 
fully sterilized, and even a hypodermic 
syringe reserved to this purpose alone; and 
further, the dose has no relation to age, but 
depends upon the weight of the patient and 
the gravity and stage of the disease. 

It will be some time before the absolute 
value of this treatment can be known. As 
already remarked, carefully sifted statistics 
covering a period of months, and even years, 
are necessary. The supply of serum even in 
Germany and France is very limited, and it is 
only with great difficulty that any samples 
are obtained in the United States. It must 
be remembered also that the preparation of 
serum itself entails a labor of some months, 
and yet within the brief period of half a dozen 
weeks several firms in the United States are 
already exploiting a product which they term 
antitoxin, and which is averred to be the 
same precise article as that manufactured by 
Behring or Aronson. Such must necessarily 
be open to suspicion, and evidence in this 
direction is afforded by the fact that one 
pharmaceutical house which took measures 
to prepare antitoxin almost with the first an- 
nouncement of its virtues does not expect to be 
able to even place samples for scientific study 
in the hands of physicians for some months 
to come. Therefore it behooves those who 
are interested in medical science and in faith- 
ful tests to look to the source of supply of 
the product employed. It may also be said 
that it is among the possibilities that the

weak side of the statistics from Europe and 
elsewhere is due to employment of uncer- 
tain antitoxin products, and insufficient care 
in sifting the series of cases. We must there- 
fore urge upon the medical profession the 
benefit of making haste but slowly: of care- 
fully substantiating every step: and of secur- 
ing on all occasions an antitoxin that is above 
suspicion. 

It is not improbable that, in spite of the 
accumulation of negative evidence, antitoxin 
will prove of some specific value, even 
though such may not accrue to its employ- 
ment in diphtheria. Experiments with im- 
munized serum in the past appear to admit 
of no conclusion but that such possesses some 
bactericidal properties, but its precise role 
has yet to be definitely determined in a way 
that can be done only after long experimen- 
tation with many diseases, and after a long 
series of epidemics, and it will have contrib- 
uted considerable to medical science in the 
line of natural history and physiology, if 
nothing more. 

It must be remembered also that there is a 
psychic factor which is strongest with the in- 
ception of every new remedy; that the primary 
evidence is always overwhelmingly positive; 
that it is not until enthusiasm is abated and 
positive and negative results are carefully 
segregated and compared that the true value 
becomes apparent. Until all this has been 
accomplished the medical profession can af- 
ford to wait, and at the same time it behooves 
them to exercise a due amount of conserva- 
tism, especially when is considered the fact 
that a large proportion of experiments must 
be at the expense of suffering humanity. In 
this connection it might be well to suggest 
the old motto of Davy Crockett: "Be sure 
you're right, then go ahead." 



GELATIN CAPSULES. 

In these days, when elegant and palatable 
medication is deemed a sine qua non, it seems 
passing strange that the gelatin capsule, 
which offers so much, is so generally ignored. 
When first invented, the convenience of the 
device for the administration of nauseous 
remedies was speedily recognized, but, unfor- 
tunately, the price was for a long time prac- 
tically prohibitive, especially to rural practi- 



tioners, who for the most part dispense their 
own remedies. 

Now, however, the price of empty capsules 
has become so greatly reduced that they are 
within the reach of all, and should seemingly 
form as much a part of the armamentarium 
therapeuticum of the physician as his pocket 
case or hypodermic syringe; moreover, they 
are made of such convenient sizes as to be 
available for almost any purpose in the way 
of medication. They form an almost abso- 
lute means of securing relatively exact doses; 
the smaller are readily taken by the youngest 
children, and their advantages in administer- 
ing quinine and nauseous drugs to the younger 
patients cannot be over-estimated. Physi- 
cians who dispense their own remedies — and 
there are few who do not carry a small pocket 
case — will find it greatly to their professional 
advantage to carry a supply of capsules for 
the purpose of enclosing the tablets, powders 
or triturates they choose to prescribe. The 
compressed tablet and the tablet triturate are 
two very popular forms of medication, yet 
both are open to the objection that by con- 
stant exposure and oxydation their outer sur- 
face is so changed that solution is delayed — 
in other words, owing to various causes they 
are not disintegrated in the stomach as read- 
ily as is desired. The crushing of the tablet or 
even a pill is a matter of but a moment, and 
enclosure in a capsule requires little manipu- 
lation while it adds greatly to convenience of 
administration, to elegance, and to conse- 
quently a degree of palatability that cannot 
otherwise be obtained. 

It is strange that these convenient aids to 
prescribing and dispensing are so often ig- 
nored—the more so as a moment devoted 
to candid reflection will convince the most 
skeptical that the capsule is very easily dis- 
solved; scarcely does it reach the stomach 
ere the lesser portion, which forms the cap, 
begins to swell and curl backwards upon 
itself, when, almost immediately, it releases 
the medicament in a form to be readily dis- 
solved and absorbed. Finally, there are few 
conditions of the economy in either health or 
disease when the capsules are not available. 
The larger forms are likewise suitable to the 
employment of remedies in the form of sup- 
positories. They are cleanly, easily intro- 
duced, and rapidly effective.

EDITORIAL NOTES. 



An Apology.— 

The article on " Direct Fixation in Frac- 
tures," which appears on page 715 (Decem- 
ber 10th) of The Medical Age, obtained 
place with the understanding it should ap- 
pear in no other periodical. The journal 
was hardly cold from the press, however, ere 
Line paper appeared in the Railway Sur- 
ge m of December 1 Sth. Had the editor of 
The Medical Age had the most faint idea 
that this atticle was to be offered to another 
journal for publication, it certainly would 
not have been admitted to these columns.

The Over=Zealous Therapeutician.— 

Professor Stokvis, speaking of the vagaries 
of modern pharmacy and chemico therapeu- 
tics, says: 

"The reason of the present situation — or 
imbroglio — is obvious. By the side of the 
'chemist stands the busy practitioner or the 
overwrought professor. Both are Oppn 
by the sense of insufficiency of their art; 
neither has the time to observe, reason, and 
conclude. It is the professor who publishes 
with railroad haste his observations and im- 
pressions, for he is ever haunted by the fear 
lest another should precede him in the new 
discovery. He it is who makes others follow, 
sheep-like, in the wake. He constitutes him- 
self a bustWng imfiressario, always on the look-

out for a new sensation, agitating himself 
and the public, and, finding that he has be- 
fore him a fickle, unquiet, impatient audience, 
he hastens to deal with new subjects, if not 
every day, at least every week. During the 
year 1893 sixty-eight new chemical products 
have been recommended to me, this figure 
not being inclusive of entirely new drugs or 
their active principles. In each case we are 
told that the new product is of the very first 
importance, of exceptional therapeutic value, 
and perfectly harmless. Fistula duke canit 
volucres dum decipit auceps. The wije man 
will not be taken in. He will be guided by 
therapeutic teaching, such as that of the im- 
mortal Baglivi, the author of the pregnant 
phrase, 'Ars tota in observationne,' or by the 
teaching of my honored friend, Professor 
Semmola, delivered with all his maestria 
Italianni from his chair in the University of 
Naples — a university which has lately set a 
glorious example to Europe by proclaiming 
that a drug that is efficacious cannot be 
harmless. Nearly all new remedies have 
their period of success, be it but for an hour, 
and this is due to 'suggestions,' either by 
medical men or patients; but, with few ex- 
ceptions, these panaceas are doomed to be 
laid aside as forgotten and antique curiosi- 
ties."

Righteous Judgment.— 

Exemplary punishment was passed by the 
Chief Presidency Magistrate on George Wil- 
liam Spalding for defaming Doctor James 
Munday in the columns of a so called "comic" 
paper — the Bombay Gossip — which has now 
followed many another ephemeral print of 
the same undesirable character into the limbo 
of decay. The defendant tried to prove a 
little too much, and took the inconsistent 
course of first attempting to justify the libel 
and then of expressing his extreme sorrow for 
its publication. Yet another plea urged was, 
that the defendant's journalistic venture has 
been an unfortunate one, and he had lost all 
the money he possessed in the undertaking. 
If this is true — and there is no reason to think 
otherwise — it does not in any way justify the 
libel, but only shows that the man who, under 
the guise of a humorist, dabbles with the good 
name of fellow-citizens, is not likely to find 
the game a paying one. Mr. Spalding, having 
deservedly lost his little all in an undertaking 
of this kind, was unable to pay the fine of one 
hundred rupees imposed upon him by Mr. 
Cooper, and if it is not forthcoming will have 
a profitable opportunity for meditation during 
fourteen days' solitude in the House of Cor- 
rection. — Bombay Gazette. 

[Doctor James Munday, who is vouched 
for as a gentleman and physician of unexcep- 
tionable character by the profession of Bom- 
bay, certainly is to be congratulated on having 
boldly prosecuted his cowardly assailant. —

Sentimentalism versus Syphilis. — 

It would be only just that men who give or 
propagate syphilis should be punished. But 
we fear that such a course is impracticable. 
Syphilis is spread in cur large cities, and we 
cannot ignore the existence of the agents by 
whom it is diffused. Some measures should 
be adopted to control the social evil. Com- 
pulsory registration does not meet with favor 
from scientific men who have studied the 
subject; and it appears that the French sys- 
tem has failed, owing to the penal clauses 
which send the unfortunates to prison and 
not to a hospital. In Italy the Contagious 
Disease Acts are no longer enforced, so that 






THE MEDICAL AGE. 



the arguments drawn from foreign customs 

no longer apply. Some control is absolutely 
demanded. Unlicensed prostitution in Lon- 
for instance, is worse than ever, in spite 
of police efforts that the streets may be kept 
clear. But tl not diminish the evil; 

you do not get rid oi dirt by simply putting 
it out of sight. — Provincial Medical Journal, 

Quarrel Over Antitoxin.— 

There is an unpleasantness m Berlin over 
the diphtheria antitoxin. Behring recently 

published an article in a lay journal in which 
he claimed priority i i the matter of the dis- 
covery and use ^\ the serum, and a&lt; I 
Virchow of not giving him credit and of rec- 
ommending the use of Aronsohn's serum. It 
seems the latter, as soon as Behring's dis- 
covery was made, at once went to work and 
manufactured a serum by the same methods, 
but stronger, and put it promptly on the 
market. Virchow publicly disclaims any 
claim for himself or others, however Evi- 
dently there has a good deal of the commer- 
cial spirit crept into the manufacture of the 
an t i t o x i n s. — Medical Record. 

Death of a Popular Scientist.— 

M. Louis Liguier, who died in Paris re- 
ceirly, was born in Montpellier in 1819, 
where he took his degree of Doctor of Medi- 
cine in 1841. A few years later he became 
professor in the Kcole de Pharmacie. In 
1850 he received the degree of Doctor of 
Science at Toulouse. He published some 
important memoirs on chemical subjects, but 
will be remembered chiefly for his numerous 
works on popular science. Since 1856 he is- 
sued the A mice Scicntifitjue, in which was sum- 
marized the most interesting and important 
scientific discoveries of the year. 

Cause of Death.— 

According to the census of 1890, of every 
10,000 deaths in the United States one will 
be from calculus, thirty-five due to Bright's 
disease, forty to fevers other than typhoid, 
fifty- nine to rheumatism, seventy to scrofula, 
130 to cancer, 140 to apoplexy, 148 to whoop- 
ing cough, 160 to dysentery, 190 to menin- 
gitis, 220 to scarlatina, 240 to ague, 250 to 
convulsions, 310 to typhoid fever, 350 to heart 
trouble, 4S0 to diphtheria, 880 to diarrhoea, 
and 1,420 to phthisis. 

Death vs. Birth Rate.— 

St. Petersburg is probably the only city in 
the world where from year to year the death 
rate exceeds the birth rate. In the 125 years 
ending 1888 there were 1 539,000 births and 
1,772,000 deaths.

This is the attractive title of the newest 
candidate for public favor in the field of 
periodical literature. The subject of travel 
naturally appeals to all, and when, as in the 
case of this initial number, it is treated by 
able pens and in the most entertaining man- 
ner, it reaches a degree of interest that is at 
once irresisiible and all absorbing. So well 
chosen are the varied contents of the number 
before us that there is no suggestion of dry- 
ness or monotony. The most interesting re- 
gions of Europe and America are drawn on 
for materials, and when these are woven into 
narrative and sketch and story and poetry, by 
such minds as the Hon. Chauncey M. Depew, 
the Hon. Theodore Roosevelt, Christine Ter- 
hune Herrick, Ella Wheeler Wilcox, Charles 
D. Lanier, Frank Chaffee, and others equally 
well known in their respective fields, they 
should bring instant and marked success to 
the publication which gives so valuable a 
contribution to the world's choicest litera- 
ture.

The Insane in FOREIGN Countries. By William 
T. Letchworth. Cloth; gilt top; 8vo; pp. 400. 
Price, $3.00. George P. Putnam's Sons, New 
York. 

This magnificent and instructive volume, 
beautifully illustrated with twenty-one plates, 
is an outcome of an investigation pursued for 
seven months, during which special attention 
was given to the varied kind of provisions 
made for the indigent insane in many coun- 
tries. The author has not contented himself 
with mere perfunctory work, but has visited 
the insane, the poor, and the unfortunate, of 
all classes, in the majority of insane asylums 
in Canada, the United States, the United 
Kingdom, Scandinavia, Germany, and France. 
He also gives the main features of lunacy 
laws in different countries, and reports with 
considerable minuteness the actual condition 
of six famous asylums; he deals even with 
the smallest of details of management, and 
goes into the history of the care and treat- 
ment of the wards of the State. Conse- 
quently the volume is an invaluable treatise 
— invaluable not only to medical men and

specialists, but to the general public. — To 
alienists especially it will prove an important 
guide. Finally, the work evinces a great 
deal of historical research whereby is accu- 
mulated much of curious and interesting ma- 
terial which cannot be obtained elsewhere 
except by the study of a large number of 
volumes. 

The author has performed a rare service, 
and it is impossible not to appreciate his la- 
bors. 



The Romance of a Transport. By W. Clark Rus- 
sell. Cloth; i2mo; pp.404. Price, $i.oo. Cas- 
sell Publishing Co., New York. 

This new sea story is an autobiographical 
account of the tragic and thrilling experiences 
of a young English girl, who in man's attire 
becomes a stowaway on board the ship in 
which her innocent lover is being conveyed 
as a convict to Tasmania. 

From first to last the volume contains not a 
single dull line. Mr. Russell is not only with- 
out a peer in the painting of sea scenes, but 
he has established himself as the legitimate 
successor of such authors as Marryatt, Wise, 
Chamier, Cupples, and Michael Scott. Every 
sentence is realistic, every word well chosen 
and excellently fitted to the topic. The great 
difference between Mr. Russell and the older 
authors mentioned is that he deals with sea 
life as observed in merchant service, while 
they devote themselves largely to the navy. 
After beginning the perusal of this volume, 
one cannot willingly lay it down before finis 
is reached. 



The Practice of Medicine. By William B. 
Stewart. A.M., M.D. Cloth; 8vo; pp. 434. Price, 
$2.75. E. B. Treat, New York. 

The author disclaims any purpose of re- 
placing the expensive and elaborate publica- 
tions, but undertakes to give the busy prac- 
titioner and student concise and accurate de- 
scriptions which will suggest outline and prac- 
tical thought on semiology, symptomatology, 
pathology, diagnosis, prognosis, and treat- 
ment. Nearly all of the prominent authori- 
ties in medical literature have been laid 
under contribution, and the most modern 
methods of treatment given due place.

The 1895 issu e keeps up the reputation 
this publication has had in the past. The 
series offers both dated and undated, and in

hance the value of the work. 



Therapeutic Brevities, 



Muirapuama as an Aphrodisiac. — Muirapu- 
ama is a combination of two aboriginal words 
signifying straight or rigid tree; it describes a 
shrub that is wtll-nigh leaflets, and which 
only attains to the height of one or two yards, 
found in clay districts of the southern and 
southwestern parts of the State of Para, as 
well as upon the slopes of Colombia and Rio 
Negro. In Brazil it is considered a direct 
tonic to the nervous system, and a most en- 
ergetic aphrodisiac. First mentioned in the 
writings of Spanish and Portuguese priests, 
in 1704, it would have played an important 
part in the Brazilian Pharmacopoeia, had it 
not been very difficult to procure; yet all the 
native practitioners sell it, but at a very high 
price. The tree is not easily found, being at 
best rather scarce, and growing amid the 
tangled vegetation of virgin forests, where 
only the natives are able to recognize it. 

The scientific study of Muirapuama, until 
recently, has never been thoroughly made. 
Led by popular belief, those who first wrote 
simply indicated its therapeutic virtues, more 
or less from hearsay; they affirmed that 
it was not poisonous and really possessed 
aphrodisiac properties. Some have sought? to 
classify it botanically, and have held it to be 
a Liriosma of the family of Oleacea. Klee- 
sattel of Stuttgart, has written a thesis on 
this subject, and Doctors Husemann of Got- 
tingen, Pekott of Rio de Janeiro, and Rees 
of Erlangen, share thus opinion. On the 
other hand, Mr. Glazion of Rio, a distin- 
guished botanist, and Doctor Clemente Mal- 
cher of Para, place Muirapuama among the 
Acanthaceae. 

Several scientists have investigated the 
therapeutical properties of this substance, 
among them Hartwig, Holfert, Heger, Kes- 
zler, Goll, Pfaff, and Kleesattel; all consider 
it an energetic tonic and stimulant to the 
nervous system, and employed it in paralysis, 
rheumatism, dyspepia, and especially in im- 
potence. Kleesattel states he cured nine 
cases of impotence in which damiana entirely 
failed. The Brazilian physicians unanimously 
praise its virtues; among them must be cited 
A. M. Baena, J. de Almeida Pinto, and Mello 
Maraes. 

During the course of a scientific mission 
undertaken at the instance of the Brazilian 
Government, I had an opportunity of bring- 
ing back with me a large quantity of the 
roots, and making chemical analysis, follow- 
ing the methods indicated by Dragendorff. 
The roots, thoroughly dried, were finely pul- 
verized, and treated in succession with petro-

The glucoside was isolated, decolorized,

and physiological ex. eriments proved it the 
active principle of the dm 

An interesting point is the very slight 
toxicity ol this substance. In animals who 
showed very active response, it was nec« 
to employ one gramme of extract or one cen- 
tigram ne of glucoside per kilogramme in or- 
der to cause death by intra- venous injection. 
Autop- ies of animals kdled by Muirapuama 
always revealed the intestine filled with blood 
from the pyloric end to the anus; the gastric 
mucous membrane of a general brownish- red 
color; the heart with a few ecchymoses at 
the level of the auriculo-ventricular valves, 
but no other lesion; the aorta colored in red, 
like the valves; the genital organs in the 
male, and the uterus in the female, slightly 
congested; the nerve centres, cord and cov- 
erings slightly colored. The kidneys, bladder 
and spleen showed no pathological changes 
whatever. 

In cold-blooded animals the injection of a 
cubic centimeter preserved for several hours 
the movements of the lungs and heart, after 
the latter had been laid bare, and the reflex 
action continued for a long time after death. 

It would hence appear that the use of this 
drug is decidedly indicated in neurasthenia 
in general, and particularly in the neuras- 
thenic conditions of digestion and circulation, 
and the asthenia of uterus and genital organs, 
with impotency.*— Doctor C. Rep.ourgeon, 
in TJietapeutic Review.

said regarding the use of Apomorph ne, and

I very rarely use even so much. In some neu- 
rotic affections of the stomach and in 
nal tube, Apomorphine will demonstrate its 
power, and by its action on the higher central 
nerves and sympathetic branches effect per- 
manent relief. I feel enthusiastic over the 
drug, simply because I have used it more 
than any other in the class of cases spoken 
of, and the physiological results have been 
most satisfactory. When employed by the 
mouth, however, I have never been pl&lt; 
with its action. — Doctor A. \ '. Barni &gt;, in

Tlie Glycerin Suppository in Gyna 
Doctor J. T. Graham, before the Virginia 
Medical Society, remarked: 

The only way in which glycerin relieves 
congestion of the uterus and its adnexa is by 
depleting the engorged vessels of these organs 
by osmosis — owing to the great affinity of 
glycerin for water. Reasoning from this fact 
it was inferred that glycerin in solid state must 
have a greater effect upon the inflamed parts 
to which it might be applied, because- it will 
take up a greater amount of serum and the 
effect be more prolonged on account of the 
gradual dissolving of the glycerin. I there- 
fore introduced into the vagina, close up to 
the cervix, an ordinary rectal glycerin sup- 
pository, and held it in place by a pledget of 
wool. The effect was much superior to that 
of the glycerin applied with the tampon. I 
also had glycerin suppositories made contain- 
ing one or two grains each of alum and 
thymol. The advantages of the glycerin sup- 
pository are: 

Easy application, as it does not require the 
use of the speculum: 

Its greater and more prolonged effect, its 
action extending at least over a period of 
thirty-six hours: 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 



It can be used in the treatment of the vir- 
gin without the use of the speculum, and will 
remain in place without the pledget of wool; 
or if it seem best the patient can be taught 
to apply it herself. 



Puerperal Eclampsia. — If the increased 
sensibility is from an over-supply of nerve- 
force stored away for the woman in par- 
turition, then Veratrum and Chloral are 
indicated: 

If a plethoric condition, the Veratrum and 
Venesection: 

If a truly anaemic and impoverished condi- 
tion of the blood, Morphine and aromatic 
spirits of Ammonia, with cautious use of 
Veratrum. 

To secure prompt and decided relief when 
treating eclampsia, whether uraemia is or is not 
present, unless the patient is very anaemic 
and with a broken down constitution, I would, 
if she is of a full habit, draw twelve to twenty 
ounces of blood, use Veratrum hypodermati- 
cally, then order a quart of warm water thrown 
into the rectum. If the convulsions are post- 
partum, first use Veratrum and warm enema, 
and see that the bladder is well emptied. 
Chloral and Chloroform by no means to be 
ignored. I dislike morphine because of its 
tendency to check secretion. Apomorphia is 
valuable in many cases, but I have had but 
little experience with it.— Doctor C. D. 
Hurd, in Annals of Gyncecology. 



Cannabis Indica. — This drug, the most ac- 
tive of non-opiate anodynes or soporifics, 
which was very popular years ago, although 
little the fashion at present, is deserving of 
a large share of professional favor. The 
principal cause which led to its disuse was 
fear of its toxic power, though there has never 
been a case of poisoning recorded from its 
use. 

Its effect on the system is most marvellous. 
It causes sleep, overcomes spasms, relieves 
pain and all nervous irritability, and that too 
within a few moments after administration. 
Its soothing and curative effects upon the 
nervous sympathetic system are great, and 
there is no one agent that will restore the equi- 
librium of nerve motion more quickly. The 
placidity of repose that is produced by this 
narcotic is rapid and to the point. Further, 
it does not check secretion or tend to consti- 
pation. It does relieve fatigue and arouse 
vital action, and can and should be given 
freely until the effect desired is apparent. — 
Doctor J. H. Gardner, in Medical Review. 



Nuclein Solution in Typhoid, Malaria, etc. 
— Doctor A. M. Boyer, of Philadelphia, in- 
forms the editor of the American Therapist 
that he has aborted apparently typical typhoid 
fever by the administration of Nuclein. At 
first he was inclined to believe the recoveries 
coincidences, but when the same class of 
cases that he hacl frequently seen develop 
typhoid in previous years got well one after 
another in a few days or a week, he could not 
gainsay the evidence though apparently in- 
credible. 

Doctor F. C. Wilson also recommends Nu- 
clein in malaria, typhoid fever, and tubercu- 
losis. He says: "In several cases of malarial 
fever its effect has been prompt and decided. 
In a number of cases of convalescence from 
typhoid fever the rapid improvement follow- 
ing its administration has been noteworthy. 
In tuberculosis in many of the symptoms, fol- 
lowing its administration the patients ex- 
pressed themselves as feeling better." 



A New Diphtheria Remedy — Professor 
Loeffler, of Greifswald, who is the foster 
parent of the so-called diphtheria bacillus, 
has introduced the following, to be applied 
with cotton upon a probe after removing the 
mucus as far as possible: 

]£ Menthol, 10 grammes. 

Toluene, q. s. to make 36 grammes. 
Absolute alcohol, 60 grammes. 
Iron-chloride solution, 4 grammes. 

The applications are to be continued every 
three hours for four or five days. It is stated 
that of ninety- seven cases treated by this mix- 
ture there has been but one death. 



Cannabis Indica for Headache.— This drug 
is a specific for a type of headache that is 
continuous or nearly continuous, lasting weeks 
or even years, usually dull, but liable to be- 
come aggravated, and felt over the whole 
head. I give one-fourth to one-half grain of 
the extract in pill, morning and evening. If 
the case proves rebellious, gradually increase 
the dose. — Doctor Mackenzie, in Medical 
Week. 



To Increase Lactation. — Administering to 
the mother volatile oils, such as anise, nut- 
meg, etc., by imparting a pleasant flavor to 
the breast milk, will sometimes cause the 
child to suck more eagerly and vigorously, 
and thus by reflex irritation of the nipples 
serve to increase the flow of milk which is be- 
coming scanty. — Louisville Medical Monthly.

I be most enlightened of our teachers 
put the typhoid cases in his general wards, 
with the result that the}- nearly all recovered. 
Another of the old school put them in the 
fever wards, with the result that they often 
ond disease when convalescent 
or almost so from the first. He overlooked 
the one great fact, which was patent even to 
my juvenile mind, that a patient with typhus 
ither dead or practically well on the 
fifteenth day of his attack, whereas the fatal 
symptoms of the typhoid might not super- 
vene till the third or even the fourth week. 
Since then typhus has been studied with 
more satisfactory results, and a few of these 
show that though it was of old and is equally 
now certain that it is conveyed by the im- 
press of a germ, or poison having the life 
history of a germ-producing organism, very 
analogous in us proceedings to the germ of 
yeast, yet that this organism is perfectly inert 
wtien distributed on a soil not responsive to 
it. The cause of the disease is not the germ 
or organism arising from it. The cause of 
the disease is simply overcrowding of popu- 
lation beyond a point ascertained with an 
accuracy like that of the density bulb or the 
thermometer in a brewer's vat. 

As clinical clerks and resident medical 
officers in the old infirmary of Edinburgh we 
know this quite well. Given a case of hemor- 
rhagic typhus, or one in which subsultus ten- 
dinum occurred at once, we knew within a nar- 
row limit of error from what part of the city 
it came. We knew that so many hours' work 
in the fever wards would give us a headache, 
and that unless we had our evening's spin 
round Arthur's Seat our six months' appoint- 



ment would n&lt;&gt;t pass without our falling per- 
manently victims to the disease. In

eminent medical officer of the city. 1&gt; 
Littlejohn, has - d its riddle, and lias 

practically demolished the disease He be- 
gan its study about 1845, and he tells us 
that in the great outbreak of 1847-8 there 
occurred an outbreak of which over 6.000 
3 were treated in the infirmary alone, and 
how many outside can never be known. The 
mortality was awful ; it can only be g 
probably being not less than twenty per cent. 
The outbreak, to use Doctor Littlejohn's 
own words, "so frightened fathers of intend- 
ing students, and general visitors, that Edin- 
burgh as a seat of a medical school, and as a 
residential city, was nearly destroyed." It 
acquired the name of the "fever city," a cog- 
nomen amply justified, seeing that at least 
fifteen per cent, of its population were at- 
tacked within two years. Active and ener- 
getic steps were taken, huge blocks of tene- 
ments were destroyed, dense populations 
were scattered, and wide boulevards cut 
through the worst parts of the old town, and 
no such outbreak nas since occurred. But 
the history of the extinction of the c 
has been gradual, for such work as had to be 
done was hardly the work of one generation 
only. In 1S57-8 the number of cases known 
fell to 139. In 1863 there were fifty seven 
deaths, representing a number of cases to be 
given by calculation as about 350. \\ 
the Notification Act came into force, and the 
exact number of cases as well as the deaths 
can be given with accuracy. The number fell 
steadily. In 1889 there were forty- three 
cases with nine deaths; in 1892, eighteen 
with three deaths; in 1893, six cases with one 
death; and this year, so far, there has not 
been a single case reported. (Two cases re- 
ported since this was written.)* Hut this is 
not all, by any means. The fever districts were 
in the old town, the regions of Cannongate, 
Trongate,St. Giles, and Cornmarket, having in 
1 86 1 an average population of 220 to the acre. 
Si this was reduced to 166 persons to 
the acre, the interval representing the time 
of the chief clearance of the infected area.

THE MEDICAL AGE. 



29 



The worst cases we had when I was a stu- 
dent were from the high lands of the Tron, 
where the population then was over three 
hundred to the acre, and some closes in the 
Grassmarket, where it probably was higher. 
Now the average population has been re- 
duced to less than half, and the very worst 
places have been completely emptied, and 
typhus has disappeared. Not a case of 
typhus has ever been known in Birmingham, 
where no part has ever been populated to 
such an extent, and practically typhus is un- 
known wherever the population is below 150 
to the acre, and it occurs with certainty when 
it is over 200. Its occasional manufacture 
by temporary overcrowding in army barracks, 
in ships, prisons, etc., has been illustrated 
over and over again till we are forced to the 
conclusion that the poison, whatever it is, is 
the result of the same cause as that which 
gives it its powers. 

I now come to the crux of my discussion, 
the application of the so-called germ theory 
to the practice of surgery, and to an explana- 
tion by it of the want of success in surgical 
practice, which ought to be and has been 
often and most successfully attributed to other 
agencies altogether; and to an explanation 
of modern success and advances in surgery 
alike erroneously attributed to the "germ 
theory" and the so-called antiseptic surgery. 

In bygone times there used to be a very 
prevalent, and even now there is a far too 
prevalent, disease of protean form which in- 
fested, and does still infest, the surgeon's 
work. We used to call it surgical fever, 
pyaemia, sapraemia, and now it is called sep- 
ticaemia—all of which names were coupled 
with certain doctrines, about which I shall 
not trouble you. It always was more or less 
closely associated with views about inflam- 
mation. A doctrine of the past generation 
was that inflammation was sthenic and asthenic, 
and that our present malady was associated 
with the latter form. Then came the dis- 
covery of the germ factor in the process of 
put efaction, and the explanation of the 
methods of sterilization, and a false conclu- 
sion was built up concerning surgical prac- 
tice, that the ill results were due to the en- 
trance into wounds of the germs of putrefac- 
tion. Then a few special, or at any rate 
special-looking, germs were identified as the 
particular germs to be dealt with, but unfor- 
tunately for them, Bacon's inevitable law 
throws them out of court. The far more 
logical position was the assumption that the 
ever and everywhere present common or 
garden germs were the cause of the trouble, 
and by far the most logical method of deal- 
ing with them was the spray. It looked so 



logical and it was so imposing, that there is 
no wonder it rushed headlong into popularity. 
I laughed at it and ridiculed it, and now it is 
pretty well done for, and to the detriment of 
nobody but the surgical-instrument makers. 
But that very spray was the cause and means 
of a discovery by Lister so great that he de- 
served everything he got in the way of honors, 
though he did not understand it at the time. 
I don't think he yet understands the great- 
ness of the discovery he made. I have never 
tired of pointing it out, but I have never been 
fully listened to; and when I hailed with 
triumph the complementary discovery of 
Hamilton and sponge grafting, I shouted to 
deaf ears. 

Lister's discovery was, like ail great things, 
very simple ! It was only this: that a blood 
clot may, and under certain circumstances 
does, retain real life; or at least it is so far re- 
moved from complete death that if aided by 
preservatives it will increase in vitality and be 
even finally, as we say, organized. He filled a 
big hole in a man's heel with protected blood 
clot; he kept out the common or garden 
germs, and that blood clot got organized and 
filled up the hole. Of course it must not be 
forgotten that all these phenomena were 
known in domestic science for centuries be- 
fore, but their surgical importance was not 
recognized; and certainly Lister's discovery 
was new in so far as it referred to blood clot 
not covered by skin or other living tissue, 
but directly exposed to air — air altered and 
deprived of its dangerous elements. Then 
came Hamilton, who showed that material 
actually dead — dead beyond all question — 
could be so prepared as to adapt itself to 
tissue of the feeblest kind, granulation cells; 
could be used by them as a temporary endo- 
skeletal arrangement, and removed by them 
by the common process of absorption when 
they were no longer in need of it. 

I have tried to estimate how many repara- 
tive operations I have performed on. the 
perineum, and I find that it cannot be much 
short of fifteen hundred, as in one year I 
have records of two hundred and twenty-six, 
whilst for many years I kept no record of 
them at all, and do not now. If we take 
them at a thousand it will be enough for my 
purpose. I have all the records of death 
certificates that ever occurred in my practice, 
and there are only two deaths associated with 
that operation in all my work. Both were 
old women nearly seventy, on whom any 
operation, however slight, would have been 
serious, and in one certainly death occurred 
from a cause (apoplexy) not a result of the 
operation, not dependent at least on the 
question now to be submitted. My mor-

tality, in ming, in this - 

tion, is under .o: per cent. My Am- 
friend who criticises my proceedings in most 

unintelligent and almost unintelligible fash- 
own mortality as over live per 
cent . and giv&lt; .owing rules for opera- 

tion: 

" Before and after every operation, wash all 
instruments in very hot carbolized water, and 
durii g every operation keep all instruments 
immersed in carbolized water. Sutuii - 

- Ik and silkworm gut, are 
boiled in a dilute solution i^\ corrosive subli- 
mate, and kept immersed in the same until 
used. Catgut - - aked in oil of juniper, and 
preserved in alcohol. 

"Always bathe denuded surfaces, both be- 
fore and after approximation by suture, with 
a i -to- 10,000 solution of corrosive sublimate. 
"Always destroy sponges used in any opera- 
tion which admits of the possibility of their 
g contaminated by septic tluid. 
" Irrigate the vagina daily if there is a dis- 
colored or offensive discharge. Prevent the 
introduction of septic germs from without by 
covering the vulva with a pad of sublimate 
gauze, which is to be changed as soiled. 

fore every operation let the operator 
and his assistants cleanse and disinfect, not 
only the part to be operated upon, but also 
their own hands and arms, in order that every 
possible suspicion of septic infection may be 
removed."' 

This writer is clearly carrying his convic- 
tions to their logical conclusion; but that 
neither are his convictions based on fact, nor 
his conclusions in the least degree necessary, 
is proved by the fact that my mortality is 
less than his, as one is to two hundred and 
fifty; yet I never in this operation used a 
single precaution such as he believes to be 
essential, nor anything approaching to them. 
We have, therefore, here the so-called "germ 
theory" and its antiseptic precautions knocked 
on tke head by one of the main features of 
Bacon's law, the effect in the most intense 
degree being constant when the alleged cause 
is absolutely absent — the effect produced 
without the cause. There may be among you 
some who would assert that neither division 
of the umbilical cord nor repair of a damaged 
perineum is a sufficiently serious operation 
to make any mortality at all. There is then 
no truth in this alleged germ theory, for the 
logical deduction of that theory is that the 
entrance of a germ or germs to any wound 
whatever is capable of producing systemic 
septic evils and death. But we must carry 
the matter further, and into the realms of 
more general surgery, for has not our Presi- 
dent said: "Lister proved conclusively, and 



roofs have been confirmed by many 
others, that ordinary cleanliness in the 1 

: wounds, either mad' by the 

surge iot sufficient, but that ihi 

of some kind of air utely 

I the risk of septic infec- 
tion." 

N id deal of my 

operation work, and I challengi any- 

one to say that they ha D anything 

about it save absolute cleanliness. Since the 

time — nearly twelve years ago — when I ran 
through a sham Listerism, ending with cold- 
water spray, never has anything in the shape 
of an antiseptic been used in the treatment 
or dressing of wounds. Yet my published 
statistics have not yet been either contra- 
vened or beaten in their record. Lister has 
admitted these two facts, and has pathetically 
pleaded that there is something in the abdo- 
men which transcends his chemicals. My 
answer is, it is not so. The abdomen is the 
only region where we have yet had com- 
peting and perfect statistics. I have chal- 
lenged Sir Joseph over and over again to 
produce his operation statistics, but with a 
lordly indifference, or something else, he pays 
no attention to the challenge. We are con- 
stantly hearing from his followers as to the 
marvellous improvements in results obtained 
under each and every new phase of the de- 
tails as they come out, but before they are 
six months old they are pronounced failures 
and something new has its turn. The last of all 
of these numerous phases is the disuse of all 
chemical destroyers of germs and the aban- 
donment of "antiseptic surgery," and the 
adoption of "aseptic surgery" — the perfect 
cleanliness which I have been preaching for 
years; and, forsooth, this is then the "newest 
Listerism." 

But in order to bring logic to bear in the 
discussion again, let us go back a generation 
— I have seen it out all but two years, for I 
am now in my twenty-eighth year of practice 
— and see what major factors have contrib- 
uted to surgical success, if success there has 
been. First of all, has there been success in 
the sense that what we may call coarse sur- 
gery is more successful than it used to be? I 
do not use this word at all with any disdain- 
ful intent; I only mean the class of surgery 
anybody may do, such as amputations. The 
finer surgery, such as ophthalmic work, opera- 
tions for hernia, ovariotomy, tying of arteries, 
etc., depends so much on the personal skill of 
the operator that it cannot with success be 
used in such an inquiry; besides, in general 
hands there are not 1 ases enough. Am- 
putations, especially those for disease, form 
by far the best test. Put can we find them

:;i 



so as to put them up as a test? I think not; 
certainly I have failed to find them, and the 
writer who puts them forward would do in- 
finite service to surgery. Let me see a list 
of 500 amputations below the knee for dis- 
ease, done under fairly good circumstances, 
and without any of Lister's dodges; and an- 
other list of 500 under equally good circum- 
stances, but under the completed system of 
germicides last announced and most believed 
in, and we might get some notion of the 
value of the latter. The mortality of the 
second list would have to be less than five 
per cent, before we accept it as worthy of 
what it pretends to be, for that mortality is 
proved to be nearly the normal mortality 
of the operation in question. 

As I look back at my early experience of 
surgery, my wonder is that I ever stuck to it. 
In Edinburgh, during my pupilage from 1861 
till 1866, I saw some thirty ovarian and other 
abdominal tumors removed without one single 
recovery, and I left the land of my birth with 
one fully made resolution — that I would never 
open an abdomen. In Edinburgh, if I saw 
an amputation of the thigh in the Old In- 
firmary on a Wednesday, there was a strong 
probability that in the following week I would 
see the bared bone sticking up through the 
anterior flap. If a breast was removed, an 
erysipelatory reddening of the flaps would 
probably occur on the third day and be half- 
way round the chest before the week was out, 
the wound gaping, and everything going to 
the bad. Erysipelas indeed was rampant. I 
left Edinburgh and have been engaged con- 
tinuously ever since, with very slight inter- 
ludes indeed, in making wounds, till they 
have mounted up to many thousands, and I 
have never seen a case of erysipelas in my 
own practice— not one. This, of course, gives 
exactly the other side of the picture, and an 
enormous improvement. It does not in any 
way belong as a result to chemical germicides, 
because I don't use them, and never did save 
in the few months of the experiment above 
alluded to. 

In what lies the improvement ? The answer 
is simple; it lies in separation of patients, 
plenty of cubic space and fresh air. The 
road to this conclusion was opened by Simp- 
son, in his book on " Hospitalism;" he showed 
that the mortality of amputation below the 
knee for diseases diminished, as did that of 
all amputations, just in proportion to the size 
of the hospital, and the crowding of the pa- 
tients which naturally resulted. This was 
confirmed by my own research and independ- 
ently by others. It would then clearly need, 
according to Bacon's canon, to be shown that 
by chemical antiseptics the mortality of this 



operation is brought down in the largest class 
of hospitals lower than it is in the smallest 
before the slightest credit could be given to 
it. Since then most of our large hospials 
have been rebuilt with the most extensive 
improvements, and it is truly pitiable to look 
at the records of mortality of some that have 
not. Amongst the latter is King's College 
Hospit.-.l, and the records there (I have had 
a private glance at some of them) are so bad 
that they dare not publish them; at least, I 
have challenged them to do so for the last 
sixteen years and they have not done so. 
Even in cases where these large hospitals 
have not been rebuilt, their surgical over- 
crowding has been remedied by the building 
all round them of small hospitals, no better 
example of this being possible than the change 
effected in our own city within these last 
twenty-five years. 

The conclusion of the argument is that this 
surgical scourge is but another form of typhus 
— a view which is by no means a novelty — 
the result of overcrowding wounded and dis- 
charging surfaces. The results of experi- 
ments - generally on a scale of ghastly mag- 
nitude and with dreadful results— have shown 
that without overcrowding the effect is rarely 
present; with overcrowding it always is, and 
above all things the experiments of irritating 
surgery have shown that just in proportion 
as the intensity of the cause, so is the effect 
varied. All the clinical facts spoken of con- 
cerning typhus bring out the analogy with 
increasing strength. It was Simpson who 
cried out after Howard against overcrowding 
in hospitals. It was Simpson who cried out 
most loudly for better ventilation and clean- 
liness, and against the use of dirty hands and 
sponges. It was he who taught after Semel- 
weiss the doctrine of contagium vivum in 
midwifery, and appealed for the aseptic treat- 
ment of lying-in women. By anaesthetics it 
was Simpson who made all our modern sur- 
gery a possibility. 

He has been dead hardly these five and 
twenty years, and all this splendid work is as 
much forgotten as if it had never been done, 
and the glorious progress which has come 
out of it is given to a theory which is no 
theory at all but a phantasm, to a system 
which has been proved an inconstancy and 
a broken reed — a thing which yie ds at 
every blast either to scholastic logic or eclec- 
tic experiment. — Lawsox Tait, in Medical 
Press and Circular.

which is hook-shaped, is, with the hand in

traction during this time with one hand on

abdominal walls upon the head. The face 
turns immediately towards the sacral hollow,

l ects of Poisonous Food. — An erup- 
tive skin-disease now prevailing in London 
almost as an epidemic, mostly in workhouse 
infirmaries, has been ascribed to the milk 
supply. Bacteriological examinations of milk 
supplied to several infirmaries gave no re- 
sults indicative of a causal relation. The 
malady has a death-rate of over ten per 
cent. 

In the same number of the British Medical 
Journal which contains the foregoing is 
statistical information as to the effects of 
poisonous food. During the months of June, 
July, and August, nearly one hundred cases 
with five deaths were reported, mostly from 
canned meats. The symptoms were: vomit- 
ing, diarrhea, severe abdominal pains, cramps, 
and collapse — symptoms that might readily 
give rise to suspicions of criminal poisoning. 
A case has recently been reported in which 
the greater part of the population of a village 
in Russian Poland was made ill by eating 
tainted herrings. — Medical News. 



Prolapse ok Rectum. — The improper 
performance of the phjsiological functions 
of the rectum contributes greatly to the ad- 
vancement of rectjl disease and to the suf- 
ferings of the afflicted: 

The comple vicarious discharge of faeces 
through an artificial anus located in the sig- 



moid flexure reduces the physiological de- 
mands on acture of the rectum to a 

minimum: 

The lessening of the physiological require 
ments is commonly in direct proportion to 

the diminution of the fa-cal flow through the 
im: 
The cessation or lessening of the fecal dis- 
charge per rectum exercises a palliati\&lt; 
curative influence on d A this portion 

of the intestinal tract. 

In certain cases of obstinate rectal pr&lt; 
the formation of a vicarious channel for I 
discharge is justifiable, both as a palliative 
and curative measure. — DOCTOR BRYANT, in 
Matthews* Medical Quarterly.

Kleiner recently presented to the cla 
Gross Medical College, Denver, a case of 
"paraguesia" Now the average reader may 
not know, at a glance, what is the meaning 
of this peculiar term; for the benefit of such 
Doctor Kleiner's definition may be given: 

" Perversions of taste are found in excitable 
nervous state-, in the hysterical and insane 
generally in the form of hyperguesia or hyper- 
esthesia of tas'e. We have also diminution 
(hypo guesid) and loss of taste (aguesia) due 
to nervous lesions, both local and central, of 
the gustatory apparatus. Par aguesia (bad 
taste) and a sense of dryness are the dis- 
agreeable symptoms for which the patient 
seeks relief." — St. Louis Clinique.

LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF MEDI- 
CINE.*

Fourth or Anatomic Period. — As already 
seen, Alexander the Great and his successors 
collected the intellectual and natural riches 
of the universe, as they knew them, and 
placed them at the disposal of studious men 
to benefit humanity; their complete value has 
•not yet been exhausted, and never can be. 
This undertaking was carried out under con- 
ditions that made it one of extreme difficulty: 
Manuscripts were then rare and most costly; 
but few copies of a given work were in 
existence, often only one, and these were 
held almost priceless. Under these circum- 
stances the establishment of a public library 
and of a museum was an act of philanthropy 
and liberality simply beyond eulogy, and did 
more to immortalize the founder of the 
collection than all his victories and other 
achievements. 

This appears to have also occurred to two 
of Alexander's lieutenants — one Eumenes, 
governor of Pergamos, and the other Ptolemy, 
governor of Egypt. After the death of the 
conqueror his generals shook off all depend- 
ence upon central government, and en- 
deavored to centralize their own authority. 
But these two were the only ones among so 
many leaders who did not devote all their 
attention to armies and invasion, but inter- 
ested themselves in commerce and arts. So 
active were they in the enterprise that 
Eumenes had gathered 200,000 volumes for 
the library at Pergamos, and Ptolemy six to

University of Buffalo, session of 1894-5. 



seven hundred thousand for that of Alexan- 
dria. The latter was divided into two parts, 
the greater and the lesser, the latter of which 
was kept in the temple of Serapis, hence 
known as the Seraphim. These notable efforts 
to found enormous collections first excited 
praiseworthy rivalry among contemporaries 
and rulers, which, however, degenerated into 
contemptible jealousy, so that some of the 
rulers of Alexandria even went so far as to 
interdict the exportation of papyrus in order 
to prevent the making of copies for the 
library of Pergamos. But the effect was un- 
expected, since it led to the invention of the 
paper of Pergamos, otherwise called parch- 
ment, which completely displaced the bark 
from which papyri were made. Be this as it 
was, the collection at Alexandria had a much 
more marked influence on the medical study 
of the future than that of Pergamos, and calls 
for our particular notice. About it sprang up 
first a collection of learned men, and then the 
inevitable result— a school of learning. It 
was Ptolemy Soter who called around him the 
most renowned men of his day. He provided 
them with homes adjoining the library, en- 
dowed them with salaries, and charged them 
with the classification and collation of manu- 
scripts, or with the giving of instruction by 
lectures and discussions. Ptolemy himself 
sometimes took part in these feasts of reason, 
which became still more frequent and formal 
under his son Ptolemy Philadelphus. These 
were called the Feasts of the Muses and of 
Apollo, i.e. ludi musarum, and consequently 
the place where they were held came to be 
termed the museum. Often the subjects for 
discussion were announced in advance, and 
those who gained the most applause received 
rewards in accordance with the merits of 
their work. Among those who enjoyed these 
advantages under the reign of these two 
Ptolemies are prominently named two physi- 
cians, Herophilus and Erasistratus, the latter

said to be the grandson tic It 

under this Philadclphus that the Hebrew 

translated into Creek the Holy 
Scripl B, which translation has since been 
called the Septuagint — so called because it is 
supposed to have been translated by the 
members of the Sanhedrim which was com- 
sed of about seventy men, or because, 
trding to another legend, it was trans- 
lated by seventy-two men in seventy-two 
hours. Th( its of ancient Egypt, 

thus supported by the dynasty of the I,a- 
gid the first place to the science of 

medicine. Study, the school 

of Alexandria eclipsed almost from its origin 
the ancient schools of Cos and Pergamos, and 
during its existence was the leading institu- 
tion of its kind in the world. At the time of 
(ialen it was sufficient to have studied there, 
or even to have resided for a short time in 
Alexandria, to obtain the reputation of being 
a physician. Nearly all the scholars of these 
five centuries had received instruction in this 
school. The principal reason for its eminence 
in medical instruction was the practice of 
dissection of human bodies which, under the 
Ptolemies, was allowed and recommended, 
and by which the science of medicine re- 
ceived an extraordinary impulse. Although 
the prejudice of Egyptians was very strong 
against those who touched a dead body, the 
Ptolemies themselves are said to have par- 
ticipated in this kind of anatomical study, 
thus destroying by their example the odium 
previously attached to dissection. Strange 
to say, however, the practice of dissection 
fell into disuse toward the end of this Ana- 
tomic Period, and scholars preferred to in- 
dulge in subtle metaphysical discussions 
rather than study human tissues. Hut the 
principal reason for giving up this practice 
was the Roman domination of Egypt; the 
Romans, inconsistently, being perfectly will- 
ing to see any amount of blood shed in the 
arena, and all sorts of inhumanities practiced 
upon living human beings, but holding that 
contact with a corpse was profanation, so 
that not a single anatomist of reputation had 
his origin in ancient Rome. " If on any oc- 
casion," says Renouard, " a foreign physician 
attached to the king or general desired to 
avail himself of the occasions that were 
afforded to examine the structures of the 



internal parts of the human body, lie was 
ed to conceal and carry off during the 
night some body abandoned to the 1 : 
prey." To complete the melancholy termina- 
tion of the Anatomic Period, the lab 

the writers of those days were all lost by the 
burning of the great library by Juli 
which was the beginning of the chain of dis- 
- with which Egv under 

Roman dominion. Although Mark Antony, 
induced thereto by the endearments and 
solicitations of Cleopatra, transported the 
library of Pergamos to Alexandria, even this 
was unavailing to restore the position of the 
school, since the atrocious and imbecile 
Caracalla took from the pensioners of the 
museum their privileges of common residence 
and every other advantage, and suppressed 
all public exhibitions and discussions. I can 
mention but few of the names most eminent 
during this Anatomic Period, and but a short 
account of the life and work of each: 

The first deserving of mention was Hero- 
philus, who was born in Chalcedon about the 
end of the fourth century before Christ, and 
supposed to be the first to undertake sys- 
tematic dissection of the human body. The 
so-called Torcular Herophili, or common 
meeting-place of the sinuses at the occiput, 
named after him, gives evidence of his influ- 
ence upon the study of anatomy. He wrote 
on all departments of medical science, con- 
cerning the eyes, the pulse, midwifery, etc., 
as well as numerous commentaries upon the 
Hippocratic writings — describing the mem- 
branes of the brain and its vessels, the 
choroid plexus, the ventricles of the brain, 
the tunics of the eye, the intestinal canal, and 
certain portions of the vascular system. He 
alluded to the thoracic duct without knowing 
its purpose, and gave a more accurate de- 
scription of the genitalia than any previous 
writer. Strange to say, but little is known of 
his later life, and of his death absolutely 
nothing. 

Erasistratus was the son of Cleombrotus, a 
student of Metrodorus, and lived for some 
time at the court of Seleucus Nicator, whose 
son Antiochus he healed of a secret ail- 
ment, which happened to be a desperate love 
affair with his mother-in-law Stratonice. He 
wrote extensively on fevers, hygiene, paraly- 
ses, therapeutics, and many other subjects;

regarded most diseases as due to over- 
indulgence in food, which is not digested — 
and consequently putrefies. Plethora was for 
him the prevailing disease, against which he 
employed not only venesection, but fasting, 
and bandaging of the extremities. He was a 
diligent student of anatomy, and carefully de- 
scribed the brain in many of its grosser fea- 
tures, regarding it as the seat of the soul and 
the centre of the nerves. He also described 
more exactly than his predecessors the valves 
of the heart, which organ he regarded as the 
origin of veins and arteries. He discovered 
the lymph-vessels, and maintained, against 
Plato and others, that the epiglottis prevents 
the entrance of fluids into the lungs, but he 
supposed digestion to be produced by mech- 
anical trituration in the stomach, and pre- 
ferred gymnastics, exercise, diet and baths to 
drugs or other therapeutic measures. He 
died about 280 b. c. 

Aretaeus, who died about 170 b. c, was 
one of the most brilliant lights of antiquity 
previous to the Christian era, but, in spite 
of all this, of his life but very little is 
known. He came from Cappadocia about 
the end of the reign of Nero, and lived in 
Alexandria. That he lived in Alexandria is 
apparent from his numerous references to its 
location, to the habits and therapeutics of 
the Egyptians, and to the geography of the 
country. Furthermore, references to its dis- 
eases abound in his writings, so that it is 
made to appear that he had had the best ad- 
vantages there, although he must have trav- 
eled extensively. But a small portion of his 
writings remains, and this consists for the 
most part of compendiums of pathology and 
therapeutics. He described disease, not in 
anatomical order from head to foot, but un- 
der the classification of acute and chronic. 
With the exception of Hippocrates he has 
shown himself the most free from vague, 
arbitrary speculation and from the dogmatism 
of the schools, of any writer of antiquity. He, 
more than any other. up to his time, endeav- 
ored to found pathology upon a sound ana- 
tomical basis. For every picture of disease he 
endeavored to provide a suitable anatomical 
accompaniment. This appears particularly, 
for instance, in his description of intestinal 
ulcers due to dysentery, or the paralyses fol- 
lowing brain affections, or his description of 



pharyngeal diphtherias, of which he gave a 
good account under the name of Syriac or 
Egyptian ulcers. Pulmonary tuberculosis, 
tetanus, and anal fistula are amply mentioned 
in his writings. His therapeutics were sim- 
ple and rational; he laid great stress upon 
dietetic treatment. His surgical writings ap- 
pear to have all been lost, but there is every 
reason to think that he brought to bear upon 
external medicine the same good sense which 
he applied to internal affections. 

Cornelius Celsus, the most celebrated author 
for a number of centuries, was born in Rome 
about the time of Christ. Brilliant as he was, 
he exerted a widespread influence for cen- 
turies. The exact date of his death is un- 
known. He was a contemporary of the great- 
est philosophers, poets, and savants of Rome 
during its most brilliant period. He studied 
rhetoric, philosophy, the art of war, eco- 
nomics, and medicine — he was, in fact, a 
walking encyclopedia of the knowledge of 
his day; but it is in medicine that he shows to 
best advantage, and in his capacity as a phy- 
sician he was and is best known. The direc- 
tion in which Celsus appears to least advan- 
tage is in failure of power of direct observa- 
tion, and in yielding unquestioning obedience 
to the views and dicta of Hippocrates, for 
whom he possessed the greatest reverence, 
not being able to brook any serious contra- 
diction or opposition to his opinions. In this 
reverence for Hippocratic authority he was 
followed by many less prominent successors, 
the consequence being a failure to train men 
as observers; the endeavor being to make 
them simply storehouses of information de- 
rived from Hippocratic writings. As a result 
Celsus wrote but little, or else his writings are 
lost. He contented himself mostly with a 
mere commentary upon the writings which he 
so highly revered. But little of his writings 
remain, and these pertain mostly to the thera- 
peutics of curable disease, dietetic, pharma- 
ceutical, and surgical. Although he exercised 
great authority during his period, he was 
later totally supplanted by Galen, and his 
views are seldom mentioned in the writings 
of those subsequent to this great physician. 
His death must have taken place during the 
first century after Christ. 

Of all the students of Hippocratic dogma- 
tism, the most earnest, skillful, and learned 






THE MEDICAL AGE. 



1 llaudius Galen, a native gamos, 

a place already celebrated for its temple 

ated to T.sculapius. for its school of 
medicine, and for a librarv which had been re- 
moved to Alexandria, lie was placed by his 
father under the most distinguished teachers 

in all of the sciences, and even as a young man 

Showed extraordinary progress, ami became 
early a disputant with the most erudite in 
grammar, history, mathematics, and philoso- 
phy. He has related how in two different 
dreams he was urged by Apollo to study 
medicine. He traveled widely for instruc- 
tion, and remained some time in Alexandria. 
On his return to his own country he was 
charged by its ruler to dress the wounded in 
the great circus, which furnished him op- 
portunity for displaying all his anatomical 
knowledge and surgical skill. Not remain- 
ing long at home, he went to Rome, where 
his renown had preceded him, and where by 
his brilliant elocution, his accurate logic, and 
his profound erudition, as well as his versa- 
tility and practical skill, he at once took the 
highest place. But here his rapid success, 
his vanity, his disdain for his colleagues, and 
his useless boasting, as well as his natural 
jealousy, gained him the enmity of nearly all 
his contemporaries, and his stay at Rome was 
thereby made very disagreeable. In his work 
on Prenotions he accuses his colleagues of 
base jealousy and stupid ignorance, lavishes 
upon them such epithets as ''thieves" and 
"poisoners," and closes by saying that after 
having unmasked them he would leave them 
to their evil designs by abandoning the great 
city to seek a home in a smaller place, where 
the surroundings would be to him more con- 
genial. This threat he carried out, but soon 
returned to Rome upon an invitation of the 
Emperors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Yerus, 
whose confidence, as well as that of their suc- 
cessors, he enjoyed. He is supposed to have 
lived to the age of seventy-one, and to have 
died about 200 ad. Galen strongly denied 
being attached to any of the sects of his day, 
and regarded as slaves those who took the title 
of Hippocratists, Praxagoreans, Herophil- 
ists, and so on. Nevertheless his predilec- 
tion in favor of the Hippocratic writings is 
well marked, for he explains, comments upon 
and amp ifies them at length, refutes the ob- 
jections of their adversaries, and gives them 



the highest place H&lt; sayi &gt;ne before 

me 1. . the true method of treating 

Hippocrates. I ( 
irn the path, but as he was the first 

to enter it he was not able to go so far as he 

wished. . . . He has not made all the 
SSary distinctions, and is often obscure, 
as is usually the case with ancients when they 
attempt to be concise. He says very little of 
complicated diseases; in a word, he has only 
sketched what another was to complete; he 
has opened the path, but has left it for a 
successor to enlarge and make it plain." This 
implies how he regarded himself as the suc- 
cessor of Hippocrates, and how little weight 
he attached to the labors of others. He held 
that there were three sorts of principles in 
man: spirits, humors, and solids. Through- 
out his metaphysical speculations (ialen 
reproduces and amplifies the Hippocratic 
dogmatism, Between perfect health and dis- 
ease there were, he thought, eight kinds of 
temperaments or imperfect mixtures compati- 
ble with the exercise of the functions of life. 
With Plato and Aristotle he thought the 
human soul to be composed of three faculties 
or parts: the vegetative, residing in the liver; 
the irascible, having its seat in the heart; and 
the rational, which resides in the brain. He 
divided diseases of the solids of the body 
into what he called distempers; he distin- 
guished between the continued and intermit- 
tent fevers, regarding the quotidian as being 
caused by phlegm, the tertian as due to yel- 
low bile, and the quartan as due to atrabile. 
In the doctrine of coction, crises, and critical 
days, he agreed with Hippocrates; with him 
he also agreed in the positive statement that 
diseases are cured by their contraries. From 
all this it will be seen that Galen must be 
regarded as one of the earliest of Hippocratic 
dogmatists. He was a most extensive writer, 
and it is said that the total number of his 
works exceeded one hundred. His contribu-J 
tions to anatomy were not insignificant. Fori 
myology he did a great deal. He wrote a 
monograph on the skeleton, in which he rec- 
ommended that bones be seen and handled, 
not merely studied from books, and that the 
student should go to Alexandria where teach- 
ers would place before him the real human 
skeleton. It has been inferred that there was 
not, in his time, in Rome a single skeleton. 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 



37 



He wrote fifteen books on anatomy, of 
which six are lacking; also an extensive 
treatise on the lesions of the human body, dis- 
tributed among seventeen books which have 
come down to us. He is supposed to have 
introduced the term "symphysis," and he 
described nearly every bone in the human 
body. By him the muscles were no longer 
considered as inert masses and tissue layers 
serving to cover the bones, but he classified 
them according to their distinct functions, 
and studied separately their form and uses. 
The location of the vessels and nerves be- 
tween them was also noted, and it was 
proved that muscles were indispensable to 
the accomplishment of voluntary motions. 
Galen was perhaps the first vivisector of all, 
since he exposed muscles of living animals 
and showed how alternate tension and re- 
laxation of distinct groups set the bones in 
motion after the manner of levers; he named 
a great number of them, but curiously took no 
note of others. His classification according 
to their uses is followed down to the present 
day — i. &lt;?., flexors, extensors, etc. 

The Hippocratic authors confounded the 
arteries with the veins. Praxagoras first dis- 
tinguished two kinds of vessels which he sup- 
posed to contain air, whence the name artery. 
Aristotle and Erasistratus maintained this 
view, which prevailed until the time of Galen, 
who devoted a book to the refutation of it, 
basing his argument upon the observation 
that always when an artery is wounded blood 
gushes out. How near he came to being the 
discoverer of the circulation may thus be 
seen. A little less reverence for authority 
and a little more capacity for observation 
would have placed him in possession of the 
knowledge, lack of which for so many centu- 
ries kept back the whole profession. He 
thought the veins originated from the liver — 
in this respect being behind Aristotle, but 
considered the heart as the common source 
of the arteries and veins. Even the portal 
system of veins mixed him up, and he erro- 
neously described a superior and inferior 
aorta, but atoned for this by describing the 
umbilical veins and arteries. Aristotle also 
had supposed all the nerves originated from 
the heart, but Galen stated that they are de- 
rived from the brain and spinal marrow, and 
pointed out two kinds of nerves: those of 



sensation, which he thought proceeded from 
the brain, and those of motion, which he con- 
sidered to originate in the spinal marrow. 
Thus he described distinct nerves of sensa- 
tion and motion, but sadly confused their 
anatomy. He seems also to have had some 
notion of the great sympathetic, although it 
was by no means accurate. He suggested 
the division of the principal nerves, in order 
to prove the fact that nervous energy is 
transmitted from the encephelon to other 
parts of the body. He speaks of glands, and 
thought they discharged their secretions 
through veins into the various cavities, but 
regarded thern rather as receptacles of ex- 
crementitious matter than as agents for secre- 
tion of valuable fluids. He even regarded 
the mammae as glandular bodies in this sense, 
although he knew of course the value of their 
secretion. To Galen we owe the division of 
the body into cranial, thoracic, and abdominal 
cavities, whose proper viscera and envelopes 
he described. He spoke of the heart as having 
the appearance of a muscle, but differing from 
it. He regarded it as the source of natural 
heat, the seat of anger and of violent pas- 
sions. He appreciated that inspiration is 
carried on by enlargement of the thoracic 
cavity. He thought that atmospheric air 
entered the cavity of the cranium through the 
cribriform plate of the ethmoid and passed 
out by the same route, carrying with it excre- 
mentitious humors from the brain which were 
discharged into the nasal fossae. But some 
portion of the air thus entering remained, 
according to his views, and combined with 
the vital spirits in the anterior ventricles of 
the brain, from which combination originated 
the animal spirits and immediate agents of 
the rational soul. These acquired their last 
attenuation in the fourth ventricle, whence 
they would pass out drop by drop through a 
round, narrow tube. 

From this brief resume of the anatomy and 
physiology of Galen it will be seen that by 
the end of the second century of the Christian 
era immense progress had been made since 
the foundation of the Alexandrian school, 
and that it was due to the impetus in the 
study of anatomy given by Herophilus and 
Erasistratus, who not only made numerous 
dissections but resorted to frequent vivisec- 
tions. It is even said that Herophilus did

not hesitate to employ his knife on live crim- 
inals who were subjected to him for experi- 
ment; but this has been a popular tradition 
about aim 5l .- y anatomist of antiquity, 
and there is do evidence in confirmation of 
the unkind rumor, although that such experi- 
ments might be legally and justly performed 
ccurred to the minds of many. Bui 
zeal for dissection rapidly cooled off, and 
Galen barely mentions five or six men who 

ed themselves to it in the space of 

. ;co years down to his time. Hespi-aks 
oi Rufus ot Ephesus, who lived under Trajan, 
of 1/ trinuSj who wrote in the beginning of the 
second century A.D., and of Quintus, who in- 
structed his own preceptor. None of them 
left a reputation, however, approaching that 
of llerophilus and Krasistratus, with whom 
Galen alone could compare by the number of 
his experiments and his discoveries. Galen 
strove as hard as one of his position might, 
by example and precept, to awaken in his 
contemporaries a desire for anatomical knowl- 
edge, but could not overcome their indiffer- 
ence. After him the practice of dissection 
appears to have been lost, either^from the re- 
doubled prejudices of the superstitious who 
opposed it, or as the result of the apathetic 
ignorance or the ignorant apathy of the phy- 
sicians. 

It has been shown that during the Hippo- 
cratic era and subsequently the physicians 
even of primitive times followed more or less 
by instinct the empirical method. Acron of 
Agrigentum was a contemporary of Pythag- 
oras, and affirmed that experience is the 
only true foundation of the healing art. 
Hippocrates, however, showed himself more 
anxious to report faithfully clinical facts than 
to dispute theoretical views. 

The surprising progress in anatomy and 
physiology made during the first portion of 
the Anatomic Period and during the better 
days of the Alexandrian institute did not 
keep men from confounding several different 
points in the Hippocratic doctrine, by which 
confidence in the same was naturally shaken. 
Thus many new speculations were hazarded 
which nullified each other. In the midst of 
this confusion practitioners continued to seek 
in experience a refuge from the incessant 
variations of dogmatism and the sterile incer- 
titude of the skeptics. Thus Empiricism as a 



school of practice became placed uj 

and firmer foundation, anil the Kmpir- 

that day seem to have laid the true 

of our art Their doctrine took at 

. rapid growth, and (ialen spoke of it 

with g ird. The circumstances under 

which it was proclaimed were most favorable 
for its propagation. Theories had fallen into 
confusion; practice, methods and opinions 
were questionable. Everything &gt;njec- 

ture, and that which rested on tin evidence 
of facts was by the empirics received with 
enthusiasm. Although founded on pure ob- 
servation, it did not put an end to differ- 
ences of opinion, and in the eyes of the an- 
cients it lacked in solidity, because it did not 
attach itself to any philosophic theory then 
known. This doctrine was then best able to 
captivate physicians on account of its sim- 
plicity, contrasted with the general inability 
to satisfy speculative minds; but for this 
very reason it subsequently fell into disgrace 
and the term "empiricism" became synon- 
ymous with ignorance. For centuries con- 
demned and despised, it was revived from 
its long humiliation under the name of the 
Experimental Method, and achieved, after 
the labors of Bacon, Locke, and Condillac, 
almost universal dominion in the sciences. 

This doctrine had been proclaimed for 
about a century, during the period of which 
we now speak, but later led men into a fond- 
ness for secondary generalities or for trie 
elevation and magnifying of trifles,, which 
confused their minds and terminated its use- 
fulness to science. Meanwhile a man of great 
intelligence, renowned as an elocutionist, 
well versed in the doctrine of philosophers 
and grammarians— namely. A.s&lt; LEPIADES of 
Bythinia — came to Rome with the intention of 
teaching rhetoric. By his talent and personal 
address he soon became one of the most 
illustrious persons in the Roman Republic — 
so early as 150 B.C. he enjoyed a high repu- 
tation as a rhetorician, and was one of the 
intimate friends of Cicero; nevertheless he 
abandoned letters, undertook the practice of 
medicine, and sought moreover to create a 
new system, being unwilling to follow in the 
track of his predecessors. Imbued with the 
philosophy of Epicurus, who was then in 
high repute, he deduced from it a theory 
which was in harmony with the philosophy of

the day. He thought that the elements of 
the body existed from eternity; that they 
were indivisible, impalpable, and perceptible 
to the reason only. These elements he named 
atoms, which were supposed to be animated 
by perpetual motion, and from which, by their 
frequent encounters and fortuitous conten- 
tion, all sensible phenomena were supposed 
to result. He explained the properties of the 
body by saying that compounds were aggre- 
gates of atoms, differing very much from 
atoms themselves. Solid silver, he said, is 
white, but, reduced to powder, appears black; 
the horn of the goat, on the contrary, is 
black, but if it be razed its particles are white. 
This, it will be seen, was the parent of our 
present atomic theory. He ridiculed the 
theories of Hippocrates concerning coction, 
crises, etc., and sarcastically called the Hip- 
pocratic treatise on therapeutics "a medita- 
tion on death." 

Asclepiades based his own therapeutics on 
endeavors so to enlarge the pores of the hu- 
man body that disease could find egress, or 
so to constrict them that it could not enter; 
consequently he rejected all violent reme- 
dies, such as vomits, purges, etc., and his 
favorite remedies were hygienic — for the most 
part bodily exercise. 

A celebrated disciple of Asclepiades was 
Themison of Laodicea (b.c. 50), who was led 
by the teachings of his master to lay the 
foundation of the so-called Methodisr?i as op- 
posed to Dogmatism in the school of Cos. 
By him and his followers a very arbitrary 
arrangement of diseases was made, accord- 
ing to what they considered the constric- 
tive or contracted, the fluxionary, congested 
or relaxed, and the mixed forms. From 
this division of diseases it appears that 
according to the methodists there were only 
two kinds of therapeutic indications to fol- 
low — namely, to relax where there was con- 
striction, to constrict where there was re- 
laxation. They, however, admitted a third 
creditable result, which they called proph- 
ylactic; but the pure methodists, such as 
Coelius Aurelianus, admitted neither specific 
disease nor specific remedies, and erased 
from their materia medica purgatives, diu- 
retics, emmenagogues, nauseants, etc. 

According to the methodist doctrine the 
study of medicine was so abridged that one 



of its prominent exponents said that he felt 
able to teach the whole of medical science in 
six months. It made rapid progress, and 
consequently was most attractive to the 
numerous young neophytes who were anxious 
to finish their apprenticeship and hasten into 
practice. It is not one of the smallest of the 
services which Galen rendered to his time 
and to posterity that he demolished the 
sophistry of the methodists, demonstrated 
the insufficiency of their practice, and brought 
to bear upon them the wittiest satire, calling 
them the asses of Thessaly, alluding thereby 
to their lack of literature and medical in- 
struction. 

In summing up, then, the basis for the 
various systems of medicine during this 
period of antiquity, it is seen that the most 
ancient doctrine of all, Dogmatism, directs 
our attention especially to the animal econ- 
omy in health and disease, that it took ac- 
count of the union of vital forces, of sympa- 
thies in the organism, and of nature's efforts 
to repel both internal and external deleteri- 
ous influences, which providential tendency 
manifests itself especially in certain acute 
diseases. This was the strong side of dog- 
matism. Its weak side consisted in this, that 
it was held that the causes of diseases in- 
here in the access of certain qualities and 
humors along with organic forces, such as 
dryness or moisture in combination with bile 
or atrabile, and the treatment was directed 
against these supposed causes. It was on 
account of this weakness that the enemies of 
dogmatism attacked it. The empirics op- 
posed the idea that inaccessible and occult 
causes of disease could become the basis for 
rational treatment. They affirmed that there 
was no consistent relation of antagonism or 
similitude between the disease and the reme- 
dies which cured it. 

The Methodists somewhat improved on the 
doctrine of empiricism, but ran wild in its im- 
provement and erected over their fundamen- 
tal theory such a superstructure of secondary 
and tertiary generalities as to cause the fun- 
damental part to be entirely obscured from 
sight. 

There were not lacking, in those days of 
old, certain educated physicians who more or 
less vaguely comprehended that the entire

truth of medicine did not inhere in any oneol 

Stems, but that there wa&gt; good and 

evil in each, rhese men, not being able to 

rules, tried to decide practi- 
cal questions according to their fancy or their 
- in. They assumed the name "ss 

or / . .'/. n-. meaning thereby that they 

adopted no exclush :i, but selei ted 

from each that which seemed to them best. 
They did not constitute a sect, because they 
had no precise dogmas nor theories, but the) 
should not be confounded with the Pyrrho- 
nians, who held to doubt as a fundamental 
doctrine; the true eclectic doubting only that 
which he could not understand. True eclec 
sm m medicine, however, is rather the ab- 
sence of fixed principles, or, as Renouard 
i, it is "individualism erected into a 
dogma, which escapes refutation because it is 
deficient in principle." Many became eclec- 
tics to avoid discussing principles, and made 
of it a shelter. In one sense, then, an eclec- 
tic is one destitute of profound convictions, 
who sides with no particular party, is com- 
mitted to no person or doctrine, and who is 
often so indifferent that he cannot judge with 
impartiality; consequently, to be truly eclectic 
is different from being an adherent of a 
school of eclecticism. 

During the historic period just reviewed, 
anatomy and physiology made most progress, 
next internal and external nosography, and 
next to these medical and surgical therapeu- 
tics, and although Coelius Aurelianus and 
Aretreus have left to us by far the best books 
issued up to their times, nevertheless not one 
of the writers of this period has achieved the 
distinction in which Hippocrates is held, since 
he, perhaps more than any other, combined 
intelligence, sincerity, disinterestedness, love 
of his art, and humanity. 
* * 

Under the classification of Renouard, 
already alluded to, the so-called Age of 
Transition includes the centuries commenc- 
ing with the death of Galen, about a.d. 201, 
and ending with the revival of letters in Ku- 
rope, about the year 1400. The first period 
of this transition age is the so-called Greek 
Period, which ends with the burning of the 
Alexandrian library, A.D. 640. 

At the time when this historic period com- 
menced, all the known world was under the 



dominance of a single man. The power of 
Septimus Severus had m t than that 

Alexander the and bid fair to be of 

a much long tence. The Roman do- 

minion, cemented by seven hundn - of 

bold and persevering government, seemed 
almost immovable. While the savages upon 
its frontiers occasionally troubled its peace, 
none were strong enough to penetrate its 
centres or place it in real peril. The great 
civil wars had ceased, or changed their ob- 
ject. Both the people and the senate, those 
two eternal competitors, had gotten over the 
struggle for supreme power; monarchical 
government was accepted as a matter of fact, 
and the citizens contended only for choice of 
a master. 

Similar changes had taken place in the 
domain of the mind; philosophical discus- 
sions, which were so essentially a part of the 
schools of the ancient Greeks, had nearly lost 
their interest and were being discontinued. 
Such disputes as took place related less to 
principle than to interpretation of the lan- 
guage of the teacher. In morals, Plato, Epi- 
curus and Zeno were followed until the prin- 
ciples of Christianity gradually supplanted 
their teaching; in physics and metaphysics 
the authority of Aristotle, and in medicine 
that of Galen, were simply undisputed. 

Conditions being such as these, there was 
naturally but one sect in medicine, and one 
method of study and practice. Medical sci- 
ence retrograded rather than progressed, sad 
to say, and was undisturbed by any remark- 
able revolution. The scepter of medicine 
passed from the hands of one nation to those 
of another, and the language of Hippocrates 
and Galen was later replaced, as will duly be 
seen, by that of Avicenna and Albucasis. 
But this Greek Period, which is one of transi- 
tion, offers little for our consideration more 
than the lives and writings of four of its most 
eminent physicians, who by their study in the 
school of Alexandria, and by their writings 
and teachings, left reputations which were 
sustained until the invasion of the Arabs. Of 
these it may be said that, while they did little 
or nothing original, and simply commented 
upon the writings of Hippocrates and Galen, 
they kept burning the torch of medical learn- 
ing which else had been almost extinguished 
by their indolent contemporaries. Of these

various commentators — for they were little 
more than that — the first of any importance 
after Galen was Oribasius, who was born in 
Pergamos (326-403) ; he early attached himself 
to the fortunes of Julian the Apostate, and 
followed him into Gaul when he was made its 
governor. Julian appreciated the good qual- 
ities of Oribasius, made him an intimate 
friend, and after he himself became emperor 
appointed his friend as quaestor at Constan- 
tinople. After the Emperor's untimely death, 
Oribasius remained faithful to his memory, 
but his jealous colleagues so falsely and so 
successfully misrepresented his fidelity that 
he was disgraced, spoiled of his office and 
property, and banished among a barbarous 
people. In this new field, however, he dis- 
played such courage, effected such extraordi- 
nary cures, discoursed so eloquently, and so 
attached to himself the savage men around 
him, that he was by them regarded as a god. 
The fame of this homage in time reached the 
ears of the Emperors Valens and Valentini- 
anus, who recalled him, reimbursed him for 
his losses, and permitted him to enjoy his 
high reputation and fortune to the end of his 
days. He was held to be the wisest man of 
his time, most skillful in medicine, and the 
most charming in conversation. He dedi- 
cated a collection of seventy books to Julian, 
his first patron, and edited at a later period 
an abridgment of this work for the benefit of 
his son. His principal merit consisted in re- 
producing the ideas of others with such clear- 
ness, order, and precision that the summaries 
that he gives of them are often preferable to 
the originals. What he has said of pregnant 
women, nursing, and the earliest education of 
the child, has been copied literally by writers 
for twelve centuries since his time. It must 
be said of him, however, that his preposses- 
sion in favor of Galen was so great that he 
adopted servilely his ideas and even his words, 
to such an extent that he has been surnamed 
"the ape of Galen." 

Aitius was born in Mesopotamia in the 
year 502, and died in 575. He studied at 
Alexandria, and afterward went to Con- 
stantinople, where he became a chamberlain 
at court. /Etius was the first medical man of 
any note who professed Christianity, as is 
shown by such passages as this one: he said 
that in the composition of certain medica- 



ments the following words should be repeated 
in a low voice: "May the God of Abraham, 
the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob 
deign to bestow upon this medicament such 
and such virtues." In another place he recom- 
mends that to extract a bone from the throat 
the following words be pronounced: '-Bone, 
as Christ caused Lazarus to come forth from 
the sepulchre, as Jonah came out of the 
whale's belly, come out of the throat, or go 
down." But he exhibits the same credulity 
in not doubting the miraculous virtues at- 
tributed by the quacks of his day to most 
remedies. 

Like Oribasius he collected everything that 
he found remarkable in the writings of his 
predecessors, and has preserved certain frag- 
ments of antiquity which would otherwise 
have been lost. His work formed a complete 
manual of medicine and surgery, except that 
it lacked anatomical descriptions and refer- 
ences to dislocations and fractures. 

Alexander of Tralles (525-605), a city of 
Lydia where Greek was spoken, was a son of 
the physician Stephen, and the most cele- 
brated of five sons who were all distinguished 
for their learning. He traveled extensively 
and fixed his residence in Rome, where he 
became celebrated. He lived to an advanced 
age, and, being no longer able to practice, 
composed a treatise of twelve books, exclu- 
sively devoted to affections that did not re- 
quire the aid of surgery. He professed the 
greatest veneration for Galen, but did not 
blindly adopt his opinions. He described the 
first reported case of excessive hunger and 
pain due to intestinal worms; he advised 
venesection in the foot rather than in the 
arm; but with all his sound judgment and 
mental enlightenment he had faith in amu- 
lets and talismans and widely recommended 
them. It may be said for him, such was the 
universal prejudice of his age, the whole 
world being plunged in superstition, that it 
was necessary for every one to pay some 
tribute to the prevailing belief; and we may 
add that it is necessary to make this excuse 
for some who practice much nearer to our- 
selves than did those ancient physicians. 

Paul, or Paulus, surnamed ^-Egineta (be- 
cause he was born in the Island of --Egina) 
was among the last of the Greek physicians 
who have special interest for us. It is

supposed that he died about \.i&gt; 690. He

him in consultation from 

a compendium of medicine 

divided 11 . books, and not only did 

not hesitate to borrow from his pre 
but quoted from them m&lt; lsively; a 

number of his chapters were taken almost 
verbatim from Oribasius; however, he made 
no secret of it, but rather boasted that be had 
judiciously sought to appropriate the b&lt; 51 
the writings of those he most revered. He 
showed originality, however, in the treatment 
of hydrocephalus, in advising paracentesis of 
the thorax and abdomen, in the extraction of 
calculi from the bladder, in the treatment of 
aneurysm, the excision of hypertrophied 
mammae in men, etc. He was the first to 
describe varicose aneurysm, and the first to 
perform the operation of bronchotomy after 
the method borrowed from Antyllus, of which 
he has transmitted a very detailed account. 
Of this Antyllus, by the way, it may be added, 
en passant, that he was one of the most dis- 
tinguished and original surgeons of antiquity. 
He flourished during the third century after 
Christ; was the first to describe the extrac- 
tion of small cataracts; and is perhaps best 
known to the surgical world to-day by his 
exceedingly bold plan of opening aneurysms, 
so successfully imitated a generation or so 
ago by James Syme. 

It has already been seen that before and 
during the early centuries of the Christian 
era the secrets and learning of the physicians 
tended to pass gradually into the hands of the 
priests. It was so in the temples of ancient 
Greece, it was so in Alexandria, it became so 
in Rome, it has been so even in modern times 
although only for brief periods of time. This 
has come about in some measure from the 
cupidity of the clerical orders, partly because 
it required a certain amount of intelligence 
and knowledge to become a priest, and partly 
because, owing to ignorance, credulity, and 
superstition, diseases have at all times been 
regarded by the ignorant as evidence of di- 
vine wrath and chastisement, or of diabolical 
or occult influences, rather than the effect of 
natural causes. Hence men have turned ever 
toward prayers, exorcism, and expiation, es- 



pecially when exhorted thereto by the pi 
This has been the t the 

practice Of medicine in all times, and when 
the priests have usurped the-: func- 

tions they have done harm rather than good. 
So long as theology and science work hand 
in hand, each red-mnds to the credit of the 
other, but always in the history of man when 
theology has appropriated that which did not 
belong to it it has brought ridicule upon 
itself and has delayed the progress of knowl- 
edge. There have been frequent rebellions 
against religious authority in ancient as m 
modern times. For instance, at the com- 
mencement of the fifth century before Christ 
the Pythagoreans were dispersed, and the 
doctrines of Cos and Cnidus, /'. e. the Hippo- 
cratic teachings, were promulgated; and again 
in the course of events when the descendants 
of yEsculapius became servile attendants at 
the temples and adjuncts to the priesthood or 
a part of it. At first, in Alexandria, the phy- 
sicians were supreme; their disciples, however, 
had the same blind reverence for authority 
that too many workers in the field of theol- 
ogy have evinced, and men once more prac- 
ticed medicine on the traditions of the past, 
and in so doing allied themselves more and 
more to the temples. 

In Rome, at first, the oldest and best in- 
structed of the relatives treated the diseases 
of his family as he understood them; simply 
shared this duty with its other members. 
Cato the censor was much engrossed with this 
domestic medicine; he wrote a book in which 
he recommended cabbage as a sovereign 
remedy in many diseases. He venerated the 
number 3, as did the Pythagoreans; did not 
disdain to transmit to posterity certain medical 
words which it was believed should be repeat- 
ed to assist in the reduction of dislocations 
and fractures. This old censor seemed to 
have a profound hatred for mdical men, and 
most absurd ideas of their works and claims, 
although doubtless many Creek physicians 
who came to Rome merited the invectives 
which he launched against them. Then 
came Asclepiades of Bythinia, as already 
mentioned, whose talents were far superior to 
those of his Roman contemporaries, and who 
did not need to call to his aid charlatanism 
and deceit. This medical hero unfortunately 
had many worthless and dishonest imitators,

who appealed to superstition and ignorance 
in every dishonest way, and who desired to 
be judged by the luxury and elegance they 
displayed. Hence for a long time in Rome, 
medicine was practiced without license. The 
Emperor Anthony the Pious was the first to 
occupy himself with regulating the practice 
of medicine. He granted certain immunities, 
but did not ask for proof of qualifications. A 
certain physician to Nero, Andromachus, was 
honored by the Emperor with the title of 
Archiater, i. e. royal healer, but Galen, who 
was physician to Marcus Aurelius, never bore 
it. From the time of Constantine the Great, 
however, the title is frequently met with 
in the edicts of the emperors. In fact there 
were two sorts of these — one named the 
Palatine, who belonged to the household 
of the reigning monarch and who held high 
rank among the nobility; and the other called 
the Popular Archiaters, who were public- 
health officers. No one could practice medi- 
cine in the jurisdiction of one of these without 
examination and authorization. Those who 
transgressed this regulation were punished 
with a fine of 2000 drachmas. The Popular 
Archiaters were pensioned by the city, en- 
joyed certain privileges, and had to attend 
the poor gratuitously. Practitioners who 
were not members of the College of Archia- 
ters had no pay, no rights, no emoluments. 
The Popular Archiaters were elected by the 
citizens from many candidates who had 
proved their capacity before the college of 
this medical organization. The evils of med- 
ical anarchy were thus remedied; this happy 
condition existed until the empire was broken 
up by barbarism. 

It is during this period, about 400 a.d., 
that we first find a class of citizens to whom 
was delegated the duty of preparing drugs 
ordered by physicians. Their duties were in 
some respects similar to those of our apothe- 
caries, although in attainment and in social 
position they were far below the physicians. 
They were termed pharmacopolists. 

It is worth while to stop a moment to 
inquire what were the medical charitable in- 
stitutions of antiquity. Even in the days of 
ancient Athens there was a certain gymna- 
sium called the Cynosarga in which abandoned 
and illegitimate children were brought up at 
public expense until such time as they were 



able to serve their country. A little later 
several private institutions of this kind were 
established. Rome in her earlier day never 
had such institutions; to be sure, she dis- 
tributed provisions, or else remitted taxes, 
to parents who were unable to support their 
children, or even permitted them to destroy 
their new born children when unable to main- 
tain them — but there were no bonds of 
sympathy which induced the patricians to 
succor the plebeians in time of disease and 
distress; slaves were cared for as were cattle. 
It is one of the debts we owe Christianity 
that under its influence the first almshouses 
and retreats were established in Rome. It 
has been said that the Emperor Marcus 
Aurelius first instituted anything like a dis- 
pensary service in the Sacred City. We are 
told also of an illustrious woman, Ste. Pauline, 
living in the midst of the greatest wealth and 
pomp, who retired from society and devoted 
her life to charity and self-denial. She went 
to Jerusalem, united with other Christian 
women of the same mission, and formed 
under the direction of St. Jerome a sister- 
hood whose members divided their time be- 
tween reading sacred books and doing good 
works. They offered an asylum for the 
faithful, and an hospice for the benefit of the 
indigent sick; and even established a home 
for convalescents outside the city walls. 
After the model thus set, heathen emperors, 
Christian kings and Moslem caliphs showed 
their zeal in this good direction by the erec- 
tion of sumptuous edifices and other rich en- 
dowments for the relief of suffering human 
beings. 

Reviewing now the Greek Period, let it be 
remembered that in the times of Galen ani- 
mals were dissected, and that he made ana- 
tomical demonstrations on monkeys; that 
sometimes the corpses of the enemy were 
rudely dissected upon the field of battle; but 
that finally the practice of dissection fell into 
disuse and human anatomy was studied only 
from books, the early Christians having 
evinced even more horror of the dead body 
for the purposes of anatomical study than 
did their pagan predecessors, while the 
Fathers of primitive times launched their 
anathemas against the dissection of human 
remains. Here again, as usual, the interfer- 
ence of the church worked only general

harm. This abandonment of anat&lt;&gt;m. 

tributed doubtless to the decadence of medi- 
cine; by the rapid extension of Christianity 
the pagan schools were dis. ! and 

broken up, the profane sciences (such as 
medicine) irere discarded, and the teachers 
still remaining in the old schools 
ruined. Passion for religious contn 

adered and took the place of study 
or original research, even to such an extent 
as to hasten the fall of the empire of the 
Mast. In addition to these fact 
enee for authority of the past, that terrribly 
oppressive weight which has kept down so 
much which would otherwise have risen 
early, and which has been the greatest 
enemy of human learning, permitted the 
explanation of natural phenomena to be 
sought only in the writings of revered an- 
cients and not in living beings. No one 
dared to advocate changes in regard to re- 
ceived doctrines, and there could be no such 
thing as progress. Only two men in the 
lapse of four centuries showed any origin- 
ality: these were Alexander of Tralles, and 
Paul of .Kgina, whose lives have already 
been briefly rehearsed. It is with some relief, 
however, that we can think that this period, 
so unfruitful in scientific progress, was not so 
in social amelioration. By the organization 
of the institutions above alluded to, charla- 
tanism was checked; by the requirement of 
capability and good character, society was 
benefited, and the charitable institutes of this 
epoch perhaps gave the world its best models 
in teaching and an insight into the most valu- 
able means of medical instruction. Of the 
old Greek Period, then, we may say that it ac- 
crues rather to the benefit of humanity than 
to that of science.

ASTHMA. 



BY DR. F. F. BELL. 

This is one of the diathetical diseases; and 
this predisposition or diathesis must be es- 
tablished in the person before he can have 
asthma, either hereditary or acquired. The 
organic change which takes place to form 
this susceptibility is situated in the nerves 
concerned in respiration. Nature, as it were, 



either by disease or hen imps her - 

upon the asthmatic, and so fine is this im- 
ren the most powerful mi 
annot reveal it; also it is possible for 
this tendency to asthma to lie dormant, but 
it will always under favorable circumstao 
ime the active form. 

In a patient attacked for the first time the 
paroxysms rally preceded by certain 

premonitory symptoms, that vary greatly 
in each individual. These generally show 
themselves the night previous to the attack, 
though in some cases the interval will be 
longer: The patient will feel himself very 
drowsy and sleepy; unable to hold the head 
up or keep eyes open, and that without hav- 
ing undergone any particular fatigue, or any 
apparent reason therefor. In some will be 
manifested unusual mental activity and buoy- 
ancy of spirits; others exhibit loss of appe- 
tite, flatulence, costiveness, certain peculiar 
epigastric sensations, profuse diuresis, and 
neuralgic pains. 

An asthma paroxysm generally occurs in 
the early morning — say from two to six 
o'clock, — though some cases first manifest 
themselves in the evening, perhaps just after 
getting into bed, before going to sleep; in 
some there is no particular time, but the on- 
set of the paroxysm begins with an exciting 
cause, such as a fit of laughter, a full stomach, 
change of wind, etc. A patient may be free 
from the disease in the city and invariably 
suffer from an attack when in the country: 
breathing the air of a particular room may 
bring on an attack; odors, particularly of 
flowers and of hay, or emanations from ani- 
mals, may at once cause an outbreak; or it 
may arise from fright, violent emotion, or 
uterine and ovarian troubles. 

Dyspnoea is the most prominent symptom 
during paroxysm, and it is during its mani- 
festation that the physician is usually called. 
Perhaps the patient has had but a few hours' 
sleep and been aroused with a distressing 
sense of want of breath, and a feeling of great 
oppression in the chest. Soon the respiratory 
efforts become violent, and the sufferer places 
elbows upon knees, raises shoulders, and 
straightens and stiffens his neck so as to 
form a point d'appui for the accessory muscles 
of respiration; and a few seconds or minutes 
develop a paroxysm of most intense dyspnoea. 



THE MEDICAL AGE.

Now the face is pale, its expression anxious; 
speech is impossible; and in spite of the most 
strenuous inspiratory efforts, very little air 
enters the lungs; expiration is prolonged and 
wheezy; the face becomes moist and the ex- 
tremities cold. 

Now what has caused this terrible seizure? 
The pneumogastric nerve^ which supplies the 
muscles of the smaller bronchi, and in health 
causes the respiratory centre to send just 
enough nerve force to them to keep up that 
beautiful rhythmical wave action of these 
muscles, sees fit to tonically spasm them 
through the same centre, some in this lobe 
and some in another; nor does even the dia- 
phragm escape, but shares the same fate as 
the smaller muscles of the bronchioles. This 
nerve is forced to act in this manner through 
a hundred different channels, some of which 
I will now take notice of. — It is very easy to 
see how an acute attack of bronchitis can 
cause asthma, and indeed it does so so often 
that we lose sight of it in this sense and 
place it in our nomenclature of diseases as" 
bronchitic asthma. 

The bronchial mucous membrane in acute 
bronchitis becomes swollen, and squeezes and 
irritates the sensitive nerve-endings of the 
vagus, and this irritation is carried to the 
respiratory centre, causing a tonic spasm of 
the smaller muscles of the bronchi — and this 
mucous membrane can be so sensitive that 
in the case of the late Doctor Flint, of New 
York, not one feather could be tolerated in 
the same room. A diseased kidney, by not 
performing its function, thus leaving in the 
circulation certain deleterious compounds 
which produce an acute bronchitis, is often 
indirectly the cause of asthma. 

A lady living in a malarial district was at- 
tacked with asthma very frequently. She 
would complain first of pain in the back and 
of scanty and very high-colored urine, which, 
if no treatment was pursued, would become 
bloody — and when this stage was reached the 
bronchitis would commence and the asthma 
follow. 

Hypertrophic rhinitis and other diseases 
of the nasal cavity will produce asthma, 
and to this organ might be added the stom- 
ach, intestines, genital organs, and last, but 
not least, the heart. We sometimes cannot 
locate the exciting cause, and then it is very 



frequently a syphilitic gummata situated in 
the brain and thus acting centrally on the 
respiratory centre. 

And so the treatment of asthma must vary 
according to the exciting cause, which must, 
before prescribing for the patient, be care- 
fully looked for. 

The indications for treatment in asthma 
are: To relieve the paroxysm — because it is at 
about this stage of the disease that the phy- 
sician is called in — by causing the patient to 
inhale the fumes of bibulous paper soaked 
in an extract of stramonium seeds, belladonna 
leaves, nitre, and then dried. Lobelia, cocaine, 
the bromides, caffeine, morphine, apomor- 
phine, atropine, chloral, Hoffman's anodyne, 
spirits— any of these, or a combination of 
them, will break up a paroxysm. During the 
intervals counter-irritation over the cervical 
region will be found beneficial." The rem- 
edies most highly recommended to prevent 
and relieve the disease are: The arsen- 
ates; strychnine; quinine; brucine; grindelia 
robusta; the iodides; electricity and the 
faradic current; and finally, I may add, a deal 
of benefit can be had by taking exercise and 
baths regularly, and— in the winter — wearing 
flannels. Also the diet should be carefully 
looked after. I will cite the treatment of one 
case of asthma in which the patient also had 
dilatation of the right cavities of the heart. 
I tried nitre-paper fumes in vain, but he was 
immediately relieved by an injection of -^ 
grain of atropine. — I gave the atropine to 
paralyze the inhibitory action of the ter- 
minal fibres of the vagus and to stimulate 
the cardiac ganglia of the sympathetic; 
and the action of the heart was immediately 
improved, the spasm of the bronchioles re- 
lieved, and the patient breathed freely. I 
then put him upon the following: a cap- 
sule containing two grains lactophenin, one 
grain quinine, three grains muriate of ammo- 
nia, one-eighth grain capsicum, ¥ V g ra i n 
strychnine — four times daily. Also : potas- 
sium iodide, ninety grains; Fowler's solu- 
tion, sixty minims; Hoffman's anodyne, two 
and one-half ounces; tincture belladonna, two 
drachms; syrup bitter orange to make six 
ounces — two teaspoonfuls in water an hour 
after meals.

DIAGNOSIS AM) SI-LF-MEDICATION. 

medication is lej when the pa- 

tient is thoroughly aware of what ails him 
and of the physiological effect of the remedy 
he applies. What a layman knows is ai 
thnntative to him as is the opinion of the 
most competent physician. 1 and 

cardiac distress follow the ingestion of cab- 
bages and rutabagas, with sufficient uniform- 
ity to demonstrate the presence of a causal 
relation, the first impulse of common se: 
better than artificial digestants and heart 
tonics. When headache follows close con- 
finement, how much better it is to get fresh 
air than to take antipyrin or phenacet 
any other nerve depressant! Yet the physi- 
cian, seeing the symptoms but not the cause, 
may easily stumble into the error of prescrib- 
ing to remove the former instead of the latter. 
There are cases where nobody knows, or is 
likely to know, so well as the patient, what the 
irregularities are which underlie his malaise; 
in such an event nobody is so competent to 
prescribe as he himself— provided he has the 
good sense to know that Nature will stand no 
trifling, but executes her laws without respect 
of persons and without mercy. If irregular- 
ities, then — over-eating, over-working, over- 
anxiety, indulgences of any kind, lack of 
exercise, lack of air, lack of good food — are 
known to exist, what more efficient advice 
could the most learned physician give than 
that the irregularities be dismissed or escaped 
from, and recovery confidently expected, 
physic being thrown to the dogs? Ignor- 
ance as to these causes of disease puts the 
medical man in a peculiarly unfortunate po- 
sition; for while he may be able to prescribe 
a remedy that will give temporary relief, 
he cannot possibly effect a cure unless he 
knows what is to be cured— which is not head- 
ache, "heartburn," "nervousness," etc., but 
bad habits. 

These exceptions aside, however, the pa- 
tient who "doctors" himself — and his name 
is Legion — forgets one point of prime import- 
ance: unless he knows enough of physiology 
and pathology to perceive the true signifi- 
cance of his symptoms, it is simply absurd 
for him to employ drugs or combinations of 
drugs suggested by desultory reading or by 
stationary or peripatetic quacks. He is more 
likely to hit a sound organ than a diseased 
one. Or if he relieves temporarily, he is 
almost certain to aggravate permanently.

He is shooting in the dark; and his knowledge 
of the nature of the ammunition even — if he 
should happen to have any such knowledge — 
is of absolutely no service, inasmuch as he 
cannot see the mark he is aiming at. 

The literature of therapeutics is more or 
less open to public inspection — from massage 
to the synthetic remedies, from balneology 
to antitoxin. Not only are medical books 
and medical journals accessible to all who 
desire to reach them, but those who do not 
care to take that trouble have the healing 
art popularized for them in the weekly news- 
papers. But in the absence of diagnostic skill, 
what boots it to know therapeutics? Bron- 
chitis, pleuritis, gastritis, enteritis, nephritis, 
may each be curable, and the layman may pos- 
sibly know the name of the curative agent; 
but unless he knows what ails him, of what 
avail is his other knowledge? 

It is precisely because of the intricacies 
and obscurities of physiology and disease- 
processes that doctors will never go out of 
fashion, in spite of all the " doctor books" 
that can be printed from now to the end of 
the world; for by the time the layman be- 
comes a reliable diagnostician he will be 
about ready to take professional honors. 

Diagnosis is the physician's forte. It is 
not all of medicine by any means, but it is 
that element which guarantees the permanent 
importance of the medical profession. More 
or less of therapeutics may be "picked up," 
but diagnosis has to be drilled into the stu- 
dent by persevering study and by varied 
clinical experience. 

And yet there are too many people who, if 
questioned, could not possibly tell how many 
pathological conditions a pain in the side 
may imply — who do not know whether in 
any particular case dizziness arises from the 
stomach, the heart, or the brain — who, aware 
that they are "constipated," remain utterly 
in the dark as to whether this condition is a 
cause or an effect — but who nevertheless do 
not hesitate to diagnose their trouble in ac- 
cordance with the trash that is set before 
them in the advertising columns of the daily 
press, and make haste to publish the effects 
of powerful stimulants or gentle narcotics on 
a debilitated body and irritable imagination 
as a "wonderful cure" of a case "given up 
by the physicians." Perhaps it is a morbid 
sentiment, but it is extremely common — this 
craving for immediate and astonishing results 
rather than for the snail-paced recoveries 
which patient Nature and more patient art 
achieve. Common sense goes a long way in 
taking the place of technical skill, but its 
usefulness has a limit; how inconceivably 
more limited must be the usefulness of that 



sciolism which swallows unknown medica- 
ments for the cure of unknown diseases ! 

Some physicians imagine that by continu- 
ing to write prescriptions that are incompre- 
hensible to the laity, they prevent the exten- 
sion of amateur self-medication. But with the 
development of reason among the multitude, 
the physician need have no fear of making 
known in plain and legible English the names 
of the remedies he employs. The protection 
afforded by bad Latin is at best a question- 
able one, as it often leads the patient to class 
the mystery of the prescription in the same 
category as the mystery of the patent medi- 
cine — he knows as much about one as he 
does about the other; whereas the perfect 
frankness which the true physician can afford 
is in no danger of encouraging self-medica- 
tion if along with the frankness goes a word 
of counsel to the effect that therapeutics 
without diagnosis is irrational and dangerous. 

The predestined growth of human intelli- 
gence will never allow the diagnostician to 
become extinct so long as human beings are 
liable to disease.

TREATING CANKER RASH. 

Editor Medical Age: 

On the western border of Lake Champlain, 
in the State of New York, about a third of a 
century ago there lived an uncultured man 
of mature years who, without any special 
qualifications for the treatment of disease, 
became quite an adept in the management of 
cases of canker rash, as scarlet fever was 
then called, and his fame in that line was so 
widely spread among the people of his county 
that his services were in great demand when- 
ever an epidemic of that dread disease made 
its appearance. 

But, in process of time, as it often happens, 
even when unlooked for, the " grim messen- 
ger " called for him, and he who had often 
saved the lives of others failed to save his own. 

Soon the people where he was best known, 
feeling that in his death they had lost a real 
friend and helper in times of sickness, began 
to look about them if perchance they might 
find someone upon whose shoulders the heal- 
ing mantle had fallen. 

But not long had they to wait, for soon a 
female, a woman of family, claimed the right 
of succession in the healing art. 

Without culture, and having no knowledge 
of the treatment of disease other than what 
might be gleaned from a copy of the " Peo- 
ple's Almanac," she started out with the bold- 
ness of an experienced professional, and soon

calls for her services came from near and 
from far. 

The regular profession was •• nowhere " 
when she could be had. But when death 

ier m its embrace the* majority 

of her patients just as she was about to cure 
them, she took shelter under the plea that 
the type of the disease had changed materi- 
ally since she began to practice, but she would 
have the mastery of its new form and 
then all would get well. 

In the midst of her work, while caring for 
an obstinate case that refused to improve Oil 
frequently repeated doses of castor oil and 
Phinney's pills, to the physician who was 
called in to take this case from her hands, in 
boasting of her wonderful skill she said 
among other things: " Why, only a few days 
ago I was called to see a boy who was awfully 
sick with erysipelas, canker rash, and scarlet 
fever, and as the erysipelas seemed to be 
troubling him the most I attended to that first 
and had it cured in less than half an hour by 
wrapping him in a sheet wet with cold salt- 
petre water, and if he had only lived a little 
longer I would have cured both of the other 
diseases." 

It is needless to add that from that time 
on, the calls for her professional services, in 
that region, failed to materialize as they had 
formerly done.

PUERPERAL ECLAHPSlA-VERATRUn 
VIRIDE. 

Editor Medical Age: 

On May 12th, 1893, I was called in consul- 
tation to a case of eclampsia. The patient 
was a primipara, robust and strong, but in 
bad condition — obstinately constipated, for 
relief of which condition no measures had 
been taken. Had been seized with severe 
headache earlier in the day, that rapidly be- 
came intensified, culminating in vomiting 
and convulsions. The attending physician 
up to the time of my arrival had bled her 
twice from the arm, administered hypoder- 
matics of morphine, inhalations of chloro- 
form, and an enema of thirty grains of chloral 
hydrate. 

We now gave a copious enema of hot 
water, repeating in an hour or so — both were 
retained, though why, I do not know; also 
dropped croton oil on tongue. She was un- 
conscious, but labor set in, the pains being 
strong and regular, and when the head was 
low, delivery was effected by forceps. 



Two days later I saw the patient again — 
temperature 104 ; pulse traveling and un- 
steady; tympanites; mind affected. Anti- 
septic douches had been employed twice 
daily since confinement, and now washing- 

out of uterus was . and carried out; 

but she only lived a tew d .. 

1 asked my colleague in this case to 
me a memorandum of the treatment em- 
ployed, for publication, which he failed t&lt;&gt; do; 
therefore 1 am obliged to rely upon memory 
solely in reporting this ease. The convul- 
sions ceased spontaneously, apparently m no 
way modified or controlled by the treatment 
instituted. At this time I had no knowledge 
of the use of veratrum in eclampsia, else it 
would have been tried. 

In September last I was called to another 
also a primipara, that had been in labor 
all night. Attempted to deliver with forceps, 
but convulsions supervened with the intro- 
duction of one blade, and 1 was compelled to 
complete the parturition by craniotomy. The 
next day Doctor Bowman saw the case with 
me; and again on the fourth day, as the con- 
vulsions still persisted. On the second occa- 
sion he remained in charge all night, and I 
suggested he employ Norwood's tincture of 
veratrum hypodermatically in thirty- or forty- 
minim doses — if he failed to control the 
spasms otherwise. In the morning he in- 
formed me he had given twelve minims of 
the veratrum, and "was glad the dose was 
no larger." This, however, put an end to 
the convulsions, and the patient made a good 
recovery, though she required medical atten- 
tion for more than a fortnight.

ERYSIPELAS. 



Editor Medical Age: 

Erysipelas is a disease we so frequently 
encounter, and sometimes proves so trouble- 
some, to say nothing of its occasionally fatal 
termination, that anything offering advan- 
tages over usual lines of treatment will, I 
presume, be welcome. 

I shall say nothing regarding aetiology or 
diagnosis, but simply draw attention to my 
experience with a very common drug. 

Boric acid gives the best results of anything 
I have ever used. My method is to make a 
poultice of linseed meal, embodying therein 
a solution (one drachm to the ounce) of pure 
boric acid in soft water; this poultice is large 
enough to completely cover the area of in- 
flammation. Of course there are times when 
this method is not practicable, on account of

the seat of disease; yet even in facial ery- 
sipelas it can frequently be used to good ad- 
vantage. But in cases where it cannot, a 
very superior ointment can be made by mix- 
ing boric acid with vaselin in the proportion 
of thirty grains to the ounce. The poultice, 
however, is preferable. 

I have had some very severe cases, and I 
never employed any measure, in any disease, 
with more signal benefit. It seems to have 
more than a purely local effect. No doubt 
some of the drug is absorbed, and the sys- 
temic action may have been beneficial. 

Boric acid has been used internally in ery- 
sipelas — as well as in many other septic dis- 
eases — with asserted benefit, though I have 
never so employed it, consequently cannot 
speak thereof. 

This method of treating this disease is cer- 
tainly preferable to hypodermatic injections, 
and more agreeable to the patient. 

I may add the boric linseed poultice is 
very useful in many other troubles, as it is 
thoroughly antiseptic and likewise acts as an 
efficient astringent.

THE INVERTED RETINAL IMAGE. 

Editor Medical Age: 

Allow me to reply to criticism appearing 
in your journal of December ioth on my 
article in Age of April 25th, "The Inverted 
Retinal Image." 

The reference to the Shawnee boy's optic 
nerves Doctor Spence characterizes as a 
" physiological crudity;" and yet it is ap- 
parent the suggestion I made may be true. 
If a photographer takes a negative, it shows 
left to right, but when the photograph is 
printed from the negative it is right to right 
and left to left. If a negative be taken 
from the photograph it will be reversed, but 
the picture printed from the second negative 
will show correct again — and so on ad infini- 
tum. So it is in the case of the Shawnee boy. 

That there is a twist in the optic nerve, is 
a fact. In Diseases of the Eye, page 593, 
Noyes, in speaking of the nerve, says it is 
slightly twisted. According to the laws of 
physics a half turn or twist would bring the 
bottom fibres on top and take the top fibres 
to the bottom and certainly erect the " in- 
verted retinal image" upon the brain, which 
is the matter of chief concern to me, for the 
explanation of which I am claiming credit. 
Very respectfully,

Editorial 



DEATH OF DOCTOR B. W. PALMER. 

It is with great sorrow we announce the 
death of this estimable gentleman, well known 
for his connection with the Medical Age, of 
which he was editor from February, 1889, to 
August, 1893. In the middle of the latter 
year Doctor Palmer gave evidence of failing 
health, and finally felt compelled to resign 
the editorial chair, since which time — up to 
his demise January 4th last, at Nyack-on- 
the-Hudson — he was for the most part ton- 
fined to the house. He leaves a widow and 
two sons. Doctor Palmer was one of the 
most genial and warm-hearted of men, which 
secured him a wide circle of friends and ac- 
quaintances. 



ANTITOXIN. 

A correspondent queries why The Medical 
Age is opposed to antitoxin in diphtheria. 

As a matter of fact The Medical Age is 
not opposed to antitoxin or the serum treat- 
ment, or any other bona fide therapeutic 
measure. Any objections that have been 
raised are not against the preparation per se, 
but deprecatory of the premature exploiting 
of this or any other remedy before it has been 
sufficiently studied for its value to be deter- 
mined with some degree of definiteness.

Everywhere the experiments during the 
past fortnight appear to have been satisfac- 
tory, and the statistics as published go to

the former average of twenty-four or twenty- 
ei rent, it appears to have fallen to 
between twelve ami fourteen per cent 

■ report- with a death-rate 

of thirteen percent.; ami twenty cases t; 
in the Willard Parker Hospital, New York, 
give a death-rate of twenty per cent. The 
reports from Paris continue to show a reduced 
mortality of fifty per cent. In London good 
results have been obtained in St. Bartholo- 
mew^ Hospital in cases not too far ad- 
vanced; but unfortunately, if we may accept 
the utterances of the British Medical Journal, 
all investigations in Great Britain are being 
conducted with secrecy. In Buda-Pesth, 
Professor Bokai reports a mortality of but 
fourteen per cent, without intubation. The 
War Department has authorized the antitoxin 
treatment in the French army, while sero- 
therapeutic services have been organized in 
Brussels, Milan, Piacenza, Turin, Madrid, 
Lisbon, Lille, and Havre. Finally, official 
reports in regard to the use of antitoxin 
in the districts of Trieste and Czernowitz 
show a large decrease in the mortality from 
diphtheria — these reports advise that the 
remedy be administered at the earliest pos- 
sible moment. 

At a recent session of the Clinical Society 
of London, opportunity was afforded several 
observers to relate their experiences with the 
serum, and, although the total number of 
cases reported was small, the consensus of 
opinion was that the efficacy of the remedy 
seemed to be assured, though the ques- 
tion of efficacy is linked with that of the 
period of the disease at which the treatment 
is instituted. Doctor MacCombie believes 
the treatment, if commenced on the second 
or third day, will usually prevent the spread 
of membrane, and sometimes too after three 
or four days of illness. Doctor Eastes con- 
cludes that every case having no laryngeal 
symptoms will recover if treated within two 
days of onset. Doctor Goodall declared that 
of thirty-two cases treated by him within 
three days of onset, only two died, whilst in 
twenty-nine admitted between the fourth 
and fourteenth day, eleven died; and that 
this is the real test of the efficacy of the 
treatment, since it is in accordance with the 
known nature of diphtheria and its toxins. 
Others expressed a doubt whether, on the 



lines «»f treatment, local ami general, hitherto 
adopted in diphtheria, there can be found 
any very marked difference in result between 

J treated from the onset ami thofl 
which there has been delay; in many of the 
that received serum injections there 
was no suspicion of local treatment. 

era! other suggestive points were 
brought out during the discussion, notably 
the possibility of isolating the antitoxin and 
administering it apart from the serum, as 
foretold by Doctor Newman — Doctor Wood- 
head, however, doubted whether a substance 
of so unstable constitution could be thus 
separated without suffering change in the 
process. 

Doctor Goodall, from personal experience, 
confuted the claim that the serum may cause 
suppression of urine; such a condition, when 
present, being due to the disease itself. 

It is impossible to compare the results re- 
ported in an altogether satisfactory way, since 
the series *of cases is not sufficiently large 
or full; yet, allowing full force to the figures 
adduced by the Clinical Society as to the 
fluctuating fatality of diphtheria in time- 
periods, the general outcome is distinctly in 
favor of the serum and of continued trial 
thereof. 



INTESTINAL SUPERDIGESTION. 

Doctor W. S. Christopher, Professor of | 
Diseases of Children in the College of Phy- 
sicians and Surgeons, and the Polyclinic, 
Chicago, has for years devoted especial at- 
tention to maladies that arise from defective 
digestion and malnutrition, more particularly 
those generally classified as bilious or "forms 
of biliousness," and as a result draws some 
very interesting conclusions. 

He frequently found food-stuffs under- 
going in the intestine a putrefactive process 
that constitutes a continuance of the de- 
composition processes set up in the albu- 
minoid molecule by the digestive ferments 
proper; in other words, a pathological fer- 
mentation induced in, or superimposed upon, 
the products of normal digestion, by micro- 
organisms varying according to the food in- 
gested. This process Doctor Christopher is 
pleased to term superdigestion, though the 
term seems not altogether applicable. 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 



51 



To the superdigestion of proteids he as- 
cribes certain forms of ptomaine poisoning 
or intoxication resulting in a group of 
symptoms defined by constipation, headache, 
drowsiness, listlessness, or even marked de- 
pression of spirits — in other words, the usual 
evidences of so-called " biliousness;" a con- 
dition that, as modified by infancy, is too often 
accompanied by contracted pupils, slow and 
shallow respiration, and depressed heart ac- 
tion, possibly culminating in irritation of the 
nerve centres, inducing convulsions. It is 
by no means uncommon to find young chil- 
dren suffering with high temperature that 
has suddenly and mysteriously supervened, 
accompanied — or more often perhaps pre- 
ceded — by convulsions that may be perma- 
nently relieved by clearing out the bowel 
and administering intestinal antiseptics; this 
symptom group should be accepted as prima 
facie evidence of ptomaine intoxication. 
Such intoxication, too, may develop a fever 
of low type closely resembling typhoid, 
which, however, culminates for better or 
worse on the second, third, or fourth day. 
In ptomaine intoxication Doctor Christopher 
believes we will find a common and potent 
source of urticaria and eruptions of erythe- 
matous character. 

When there is superdigestion of fats, the 
fatty acids are broken up to the production 
of hydrogen and carbon-dioxide — such is 
more especially likely to supervene upon an 
albuminous diet, and occurs most frequently 
in connection with gaseous fermentation of 
carbohydrates — and a condition is induced 
that constitutes the most painful of the vari- 
ous maladies generally denominated " dys- 
pepsia " The craving for albuminoids by 
such patients is often so great that nothing 
but the tortures of the malady will prevent 
their ingestion; and here the ordinary di- 
gestants, and notably the pancreatic fer- 
ments, merely add fuel to the flame, as it 
were, and cause additional suffering. In- 
deed, the only ferment which is efficient in 
this connection is malt diastase, *by means 
of which it is possible to digest the starch 
that forms in the stomach, the greater por- 
tion being thus absorbed in the organ itself 
or in the duodenum, and little or none per- 
mitted to reach the lower intestines. 

Carbohydrate superdigestion is a very 



common occurrence, but it has of late been 
repeatedly shown that it yields promptly to 
good diastase — that the diastasic ferment 
quickly arrests the most severe case, even 
when starchy foods are permitted in limited 
quantities. This form of " dyspepsia," how-' 
ever, is particularly apt to recur. 



"THE STILL SHALL VOICE." 

Under this caption the Washington Post in 
good faith indulges in a most extraordinary 
pathological dissertation upon the seat of the 
conscience. It is so rich we reproduce it in 
toto: 

The conscience, that still small voice, has always 
been of more interest to metaphysicians than to 
surgeons. Its existence was recognized by the 
earliest philosophers, but even the most advanced 
materialists of modern times have not attempted to 
locate its habitation in the human organism. That 
it is a part of man's make-up has in fact been a 
stumbling-block to the iconoclastic scientists of our 
day. Between materialism and accepted truth the 
conscience stood alone as a barrier. 

Now, however, this obstacle has been removed 
and the materialist stands for the moment triumph- 
ant. He has discovered that the conscience, like 
the memory, is simply a combination of tissues. 
No greater victory was ever won by the surgeon's 
knife. The way of it was this: 

A noted manipulator of the scalpel began years 
ago to make a close study of the vermiform ap- 
pendage, that seemingly useless portion of our 
anatomy known as "the blind intestine." Here 
was a sac that seemed ordained by nature for 
nothing but destruction. If, in the course of the 
digestive process, a seed or other hard substance 
left the beaten track and dropped into the "blind 
intestine," the victim of such a mishap was doomed 
to death. Neither medicine nor surgery could save 
him. Science asserted that this fatal sac was 
wholly useless and simply a menace to human life. 
"Our hero," a surgeon whose name is world-re- 
nowned, determined to solve this ancient mystery. 
He devoted years to the task, and finally invented 
a method whereby the unlucky wight who had 
dared the inflammatory wrath of the blind intes- 
tine might be saved His process consisted in the 
skillful manipulation of the knife and the excision 
of the offending sac. Many an unhappy sufferer 
owes his life to this brilliant triumph of surgical 
ingenuity. 

After a time the surgeon who had achieved this 
great victory became impressed by a certain sug- 
gestive fact. He had made a practice of following 
his patients in their respective careers after they 
had recovered from the effects of his nimble knife. 
To his surprise he found that the removal of the 
vermiform appendage had a marked influence upon 






THE MEDICAL AGE. 



the moral nature of the man who had und&lt; 

the operation. After repea riments he came 

to the a that the teat &lt;d th&lt;

Sncfa a itartling deduction was, of course, not to 

be accepted without convincil Our sur- 

hercfore, confided his theory to -

who ha his lite and death a remark-

they found that the intestines were wholly devoid

ur&gt;c, they reasoned, this may have been a 
coincidence. Our surgeon smiled and assured 
them that his theory was correct. Some weeks 
later the committee cut open the body of a man 
who had lost his life through an utter indifference 
to the distinctions between right and wrong. 
the surgeons failed to find the blind sac. 

There was enough in all this to arouse the curi- 
ho had taken part in the, autopsies. 
One of them, a practitioner who was noted for his 
conscientiousness, agreed to have his vermiform 
appendage removed in order to prove conclusively 
the truth or falsity of the proposition under discus- 
sion. He endured the operation with heroic calm- 
ness, and made a quick recovery. A few weeks 
later he murdered his mother in-law in cold blood. 

There is no longer a shadow of doubt that the seat 
of the conscience is in the vermiform appendage. 

Great is the lay press in medical science ! 



ANOTHER NEW IDEA. 

We have before in these columns had oc- 
casion to refer to pernicious attempts to force 
Kola upon both the medical profession and 
the laity as a panacea. The latest effort 
in this direction appears in the form of a 
pamphlet with highly artistic cover — indeed, 
the cover is the main part of the pamphlet, 
and cannot fail to convince the most skep- 
tical practitioner. In the background appears 
a yellow tree of unknown species resting in 
a green prairie bordered by a white river, 
the further side of which is bounded by 
green rocks. At the roots of the anomalous 
arboraceous growth appear two pink sav- 
ages clothed exclusively in white shields and 
spears with blades two feet long. A green 
snake in the tree, and a pair of blue elephants 
at the riverside, give evidence that "Kola 
is nature's specific for the cure of asthma." 
Along with this wonderful book, which is 
filled to repletion with certificates made to 
order, and most horrible wood-cuts copied 



from a bastard plagiarized edition of Stan- 
ley's work, goes a circular bearing a letier- 

head impress of green m. nth white 

diapers plucking Kola nuts from plants 

eighteen inches high on the border of a 
lagoon which is about to afford pa 
for a Mississippi River steamboat. The 
literature of this circular assurer us that the 
particular compound of Kola is a "positive 
constitutional cure for asthma;" and it answers 
the query how much will be required, by the 
Statement that only three bottles of this 
wonderful nostrum at $3.00 per bottle will 
guarantee a cure. The title of the stuff is 
not Kola, but taken from the mountains of 
Northern India, though it is claimed Kola is 
the chief constituent. 

What a boon it is to know that such a very 
11 reliable company" as that which put forth 
this elegant literature, will "positively guar- 
antee a cure!" It makes no difference as to 
the precise cause of the asthma, since three 
bottles — we should say nine dollars — " cures 
by acting gradually on the blood and consti- 
tution." Great is charlatanry. 



A SHAME. 



The medical profession is constantly on 
the qui vive in its attempts to combat quack- 
ery; but what shall be said when journals 
purporting to be devoted to medical science 
boldly uphold and foster this evil ? Only re- 
cently a Southern medical periodical devoted 
its chief editorial to puffing proprietary reme- 
dies, evidently with a view to exploiting the 
same in its advertising columns. It declares 
that ''all the resources of art and science 
have been contributed to the manufacture" of 
such, and that therefore they must be "much 
better than the prescriptions hastily and crudely 
compounded at the drug stores;" that "every- 
body knows the profits made from the sale 
of drugs far exceed those obtained from the 
sale of proprietary medicines, but the profit 
gained in the first place is at the expense of 
the patient, and in the second at the expense 
of the druggist;" and again, that in prescrib- 
ing such remedies "we always get the purest 
qualities of the drug compounded with the 
greatest skill." 

This is "stealing the livery of heaven to 
serve the devil in," with a vengeance. 



THE MEDICAL AGE.

THE ANTI=VACCINATIONISTS. 

This particular group of faddists are be- 
coming very much alive of late, and flooding 
the universe with their literature. The latest 
crime attributed to vaccination is that it in- 
duces decay of the teeth. The argument 
runs thus : As savages appear to have sound 
grinders, and all civilized people the oppo- 
site, the latter must owe this peculiar condi- 
tion to the fact that they indulge in vaccina- 
tion. 

Great is the discovery! 

Further, for outrageous, bald-faced impu- 
dence, commend us to the tracts of the London 
Society for the Abolition of Compulsory Vac- 
cination, which deal with data that are not 
alone absolutely and scandalously false and 
misleading, but " manufactured from whole 
cloth !" 



EDITORIAL NOTES. 



Fraudulent Antitoxin. — 

Already have been put on the market 
i one or more fraudulent antitoxins for the 
cure of diphtheria. The German prepara- 
tions that have found their way to this coun- 
try here and there are the only ones known 
to be reliable and guaranteed. Inasmuch 
as the time necessary to growing the first 
crop of antitoxin cannot be less than six 
months, it will be readily seen that such 
rapidly matured plants must be throwing off 
an immature and worthless article. — Jour- 
nal of the American Medical Association. 

The foregoing is corroborated by the Med- 
ical Record. 

The Boards of Health of New York City 
and Brooklyn, and likewise Messrs. Parke, 
Davis &amp; Co., have taken up the work of pro- 
ducing antitoxin, but their stocks cannot be- 
come available to the public for four or five 
months to come. Under the circumstances 
it behooves every medical man to scrutinize 
the product offered, and likewise to know the 
length of time that has elapsed between the 
establishment of the plant and the marketing 
of the antitoxin. 

The Dangers of Bread and Butter.— 

Under the above caption the Medical Record 
recently listed all the dangers that accrue to 



the use of this homely but nourishing diet 
as follows: 

Bacillus subtilis, variety i (hay bacillus); 
bacillus subtilis, variety 2 (hay bacillus); 
bacillus subtilis, variety 3 (hay bacillus); 
sarcina (a), large; sarcina (&amp;), smaller than 
a; bacillus A (large, thick, rounded ends); 
bacillus B (large, thick, smaller than A); 
bacillus C (small, copious spore formation); 
bacillus D (smaller, still some spore forma- 
tion); bacillus E (bacillus figurans); micro- 
coccus A (small white colonies); micrococcus 
B (rosaceus ?), accidental; staphylococcus 
(very regular, larger than staphylococcus 
aureus). 

To this the Homoeopathic Recorder suggests 
that if we are to be deprived of food at this 
rate we shall soon be forced to live on canvas- 
back duck, no flies having been discovered 
on that member of the Anatidae up to date. 

The Detroit Medical and Library Associa= 
tion.— 

At the last session of this Society— Janu- 
ary 14th — it was resolved to invite Doctor 
Karl Schwickerath, a physiological chemist 
in the employ of Messrs. Parke, Davis &amp; Co., 
to lecture before the Association in the near 
future upon toxins, antitoxins, and serum 
treatment, illustrating the same by practical 
demonstrations; also that the other local med- 
ical societies be invited to attend. 

This resolution was brought out by the 
fact that the subject just now is of great in- 
terest, and the lecture would adduce prac- 
tical information regarding chemical pro- 
cesses that are not generally available in 
medical literature. 

Literary Elegance.— 

In a recent number of a Texas journal ap- 
pears an article with the astounding title: 

"The Amazing Infatuation of the Texas 
State Medical Association in Pompously Par- 
ading its Appalling Ignorance of the First 
Principles of Sanitary Legislation; and its 
Unbounded Cheek and Unmitigated Gall in 
Presuming to Instruct Congress in the Proper 
Performance of its Duties — Succinctly Set 
Forth." 

Two Sides of the Question.—

asserted that: The graduate of 1854 is a-

drug was added to a pint of gin, of which the 
woman took a tablespoonfu! twice a day for 
a fortnight with a view of producing abor- 
tion. 

Death of Doctor George W. Topping.— 

Doctor Topping, a former President of the 
Michigan State Medical Society, and a well 
known figure at all medical gatherings in the 
State, died suddenly at his home in De Witt, 
Michigan, January 14th. Few men stood 
higher in the profession or were more gener- 
ally loved and respected. 

Death from Chickenpox.— 

Doctor W. B. Nisbit, of Townsville, Queens 
land, reports a fatality in an infant eight and 
a half months old, from chickenpox. This is 
somewhat remarkable, since the malady is 
universally deemed objectionable and teasing 
rather than fatal in character. 

A Journalistic Change.— 

The Practitioner (London) has changed 
editor and publisher. It is now under the

In a Nutshell.— 

The formula of the nostrum, as published 
to the medical profession, exhibits the art of 
"how not to do it" brought near perfection. 

We are reminded of this by the receipt of 

a box labeled "Sample. ine. (Modified 

Formula of Sir Astley Cooper.) FORMULA; 
Alum, with the irritating properties of the 
drug eliminated, with Carbolic Acid and Ich- 
thyol added. For directions see circular." 

The idea of an ingredient so modified that 
its action is different from the ordinary action 
of the drug is a favorite one with the com- 
pounders of secret nostrums; and the use of 
some great name to give a show of respecta- 
bility is also an old trick; but the happy 
combination of alum modified so as to be 
free of its irritant properties, and Sir Astley 
Cooper's formula, with two ingredients added, 
either of which is far more active than the 
original preparation, is as bold as it is origi- 
nal. — Polyclinic. 

A Lesson Taught.— 

The story goes that not long ago the peo- 
ple of one of the West India Islands in- 
troduced the mongoose (or ichneumon) to 
clear out the rats and other "small deer" 
that infested their homes. The mongoose 
went to work and multiplied until the rat 
supply would no longer support them. They

•cleaned out the rats, snakes, birds, and fowl, 
and at last account were beginning on the 
young of larger animals; and the people 
of that island sigh for the good old days 
when rats swarmed and the mongoose was 
unknown, for as the birds disappeared insects 
increased until now they are a plague — a 
plague of insects and a plague of mongoose. 
There are to-day a number of medical ich- 
neumons that the cautious man should handle 
with extreme care, such as antitoxin, hydro- 
phobia virus, consumption lymph, cholera 
extract, etc. — Homoeopathic Recorder. 

And Why? 

The New York City Board of Health has 
adopted the following resolutions: 

" That no preparation of diphtheria anti- 
toxin shall be offered or exposed for sale in 
this city unless the receptacle containing 
such preparation has a label on which is 
placed a statement of the value of the con- 
tents in antitoxin, as measured by some gen- 
erally recognized standard, and the name 
and address of the producer." 

No one doubts that this resolution is in the 
interest of public health. But it is a curious 
fact that such a resolution is allowed to pass 
unnoticed by the advocates of personal lib- 
! erty. The newspapers advertise, the drug 
stores display, any number of spurious cures 
for cancer, consumption, epilepsy, etc., and 
no one protests. But the sale of a spurious 
I cure for diphtheria is forbidden! — Medical 
Record. 

In re Tablet Triturates.— 

In these days, when elegant and palatable 
, medication is deemed so essential, why should 
the tablet triturate hold a place when it ful- 
■ fills none of these demands and can only be 
recommended on the ground of the division 
of the dose ? In no way is the flavor of the 
medicament covered. On the contrary, in 
some instances, as with strychnine, the ill 
taste is rather enhanced. 

Where exact divisibility is desired, why not 
secure palatability also by crushing the tablet 
triturate and enclosing in the convenient gel- 
! atin capsule? 

Another "Gold Cure" Victim.— 

An inquest, resulting in a verdict of " death 
from alcoholism," was held in Chicago on the 
1 2th inst. The victim— a commercial trav-* 
eler named Dresser — was discharged "cured" 
from a "jag" institute about three years 
since, and, for a time, was one of the " star " 
cures. This makes the sixth or seventh 
" post " held in that city, within a few months, 



on "graduates of the gold cure." It might 
be worth while to gather up the statistics of 
this kind for the country at large. — Journal 
of the American Medical Association. 

Got Well.— 

Deacon Humsted: Then I sewed up the 
cut with waxed ends and covered it with a 
coat of tar to keep off the flies, and the next 
day the old cow was as good as ever. 

Doctor Cutter: You don't mean to say she 
recovered ? 

Deacon Humsted: Come out of it straight 
as a string, sir ! 

Doctor Cutter: Wonderful ! truly wonder- 
ful ! 

Deacon Humsted: Yes, my son says that 
shows the difference between amateur and 
perfessional surgery. — Life. 

Change of Sex. — 

Recently the Sheriff at Airdrie, England, 
was asked by the Coatbridge Registrar for 
permission to alter the register sex of a child 
from female to male. It appears that the 
child had been declared by the medical at- 
tendant at the time of birth to be a girl, but 
after eight or ten days, on certain inflamma- 
tory symptoms disappearing, the supposed 
girl turned out to be a boy. The register 
was accordingly altered. 

Differs from Tuberculin.— 

Some may have an idea that antitoxin is 
like tuberculin, and like it liable to inspire 
too great hope to withstand the test of time; 
but the two are quite different processes. 
With tuberculin a toxin is injected to develop 
antitoxin in the body, while in diphtheria an- 
titoxin is first produced in the bodies of ani- 
mals, and then injected into patients afflicted 
with diphtheria. — Medical Record. 

Hypodermatic Catharsis. — 

The editor of The Medical Age has been 
investigating this subject quite extensively 
and has concluded that catharsis by hypo- 
dermatic injections with any known drug is 
a failure. We are sorry to say that his in- 
vestigations correspond with our own experi- 
ence. — Doctor J. M. Dunham, in Columbus 
Medical Journal. 

Rectal riedication. — 

No more convenient method of administer- 
ing a rectal suppository can be had than by 
enclosing the medicament in a gelatin cap- 
sule. It is cleanly, safe, and certain in effect. 

By moistening the capsule externally its 
introduction is rendered painless and its 
speedy solution assured.

and Tracy C. Becker, A.B , LL.B. Volume 
Second; cloth; 8vo; pp. 751. Price, $5.00. Wil- 
liam Wood &amp; Co. New York. 

The second volume, even more forcibly 
than the first, exhibits the high character 
of this work, of which there are yet two 
volumes to appear. Moreover the illustra- 
tions and plates, some of them in colors, are 
of the highest type of art. It embodies

Treatise on Diseases of the Eye. By D. B. St. 
John Roosa, M.D , LL.D. Cloth; 8vo; pp. 650. 
Price, $5.50. William Wood &amp; Co., New York. 

This well known text-book comes to us in 
a new, revised and enlarged edition, with one 
hundred and seventy-eight original engrav- 
ings, besides full-page chromo-lithographic 
plates. Of its scientific value and practical 
utility it is unnecessary to speak — the au- 
thor's name is sufficient guarantee in this 
direction, and likewise that it will meet in 
the future, as in the past, the greatest favor 
at the hands of the profession. The follow- 
ing extract from the preface shows the mo- 
tive and scope of the work: 

This book has not been written because the au- 
thor supposed, for an instant, that there were not al- 
ready in the English tongue many excellent treatises 
on diseases of the eye. It is presented to the profes- 
sion because I have not deemed that the debt I 
owe to it could be even approximately satisfied, nor 
my own reputation as a teacher, whatever that may 
be, justly considered, unless I presented in a perma- 
nent and accessible form some of the results, with 
their personal coloring, of my long experience 
both in hospital and private practice in ophthalmic 
diseases and therapeutics. 

There is probably no work devoted to the 
eye in the English language that is so satis- 
factory as this by Doctor Roosa. 



Brother Against Brother. By Oliver Optic. 
Cloth; i6mo; pp. 451. Price. $1.50. Lee &amp; Shep- 
ard, Boston. 

Oliver Optic's books are always interest- 
ing. This new tale is the first of the Blue 
and Gray Army Series, which will include six 
volumes; though, as its author remarks in 
the preface, the number is "contingent upon 
the longevity of one, still hale and hearty, 
who has passed by a couple of years the 
scriptural limit of "three score years and ten 
allotted to man's life." 

Old and young alike hope that Oliver Optic 
will be able for many years to come to give 
them periodically stories as full of fascinating 
interest as those he has been writing for the 
last forty years. 

The scene of Brother Against Brother is 
laid in Kentucky, and the time of the story 
is that of the beginning of the civil war. It 
is fully as attractive as any of the publica-

The Cent \ &lt;&gt;rk. 

This is a delightful story of a summer out- 
ing in a Canadian forest on the banks of a 
salmon stream. While a thread of romance 
with love-making is woven in, there is a 
great deal equally or more interesting de- 
voted to outdoor life, the ethics of fishing, 
and the art of fly-casting. Incidentally there 
lerable instruction on how to 
bring up a family of boys, and especially how 
to manage the youngsters w»hen turned loose 
in the forest. Nor are the philosophical or 
ical elements forgotten, and two pe- 
culiar female characters are well worthy of 
study — one uncouth, but almost an angel in 

&gt;ition, the other a she villain, 
whole the work is eminently readable and 
interesting, and will be more enjoyable to 
physicians in that it is written by one of the 
foremost of medical specialists. 



Thrki \ a Madhouse. By E. D. and 

Augustine Fleming. Cloth; Svo; pp. 240. Price, 
0. Donahue, Henneberry &amp; Co., Chicago. 

This is certainly a remarkable volume. It 
purports to be the autobiography of Mr. E. 
B. Fleming, formerly a merchant of Sulphur 
Springs, Texas, who was confined in the 
Northern Texas Insane Asylum as a hope- 
less maniac. During three years in this in- 
stitution his reason gradually returned, but 
despairing of ever being released he cun- 
ningly made his escape and was never again 
captured, indeed was never heard of by his 
relatives for some years. The book includes 
a description not only of life in the asylum — 
which certainly is flattering rather than other- 
wise to the officials of that institution— but of 
his trials and hardships, during which he suc- 
ceeded in making a journey across the con- 
tinent to California, where he entered life 
anew and established himself in business. 



Hidden DEPTHS. By F. M. F. Skene. Paper; 
i2mo; pp. 260. Price, 50 cents. Rand, McNally 
&amp; Co., Chicago. 

This one of the publishers' famous Rialto 
Series is not a work of fiction in the ordi- 
nary acceptance of the term, and yet it is 
drawn upon fiction lines. It is a work strong 



in the cause &lt;»t M justice, mercy, and truth" 
— a touching st&lt; . and despair, 

intended to be the means of stopping some 
of the world's people from entering on the 
downward road, and perchance coaxing them 
vel in ti ht and narrow path." 

We understand that the book has been 
condemned — why, we fail to see. Evil can- 
not be covered, consequently it is better to

This is number 65 of the well known Rialte 
Series, and is a work of unusual interest and 
merit. The plot deals with a Hebrew lady 
who, unless she marries one of her own race, 
will lose her great wealth. She is first de- 
picted as of a somewhat sordid nature, but 
affection finally triumphs over all and she is 
united to the man whom she truly loves. By 
a peculiar turn of fate a cousin who comes 
into possession of her property dies suddenly, 
leaving it back to her in his will.

Therapeutic Brevities, 



Creosote in Phthisis.— T) odor J. C. Mulhall 
declares he has made use of Creosote con- 
stantly for ten years in the treatment of 
tuberculosis, and believes it to be by all odds 
the most important therapeutic aid yet dis- 
covered. Creosote, cod- liver oil and whiskey 
form a triad in which there is strength when 
skillfully used. The sputum is much dimin- 
ished in quantity, improved in quality, and 
facilitated in dejection; the patient's appetite 
is increased, digestion strengthened, fever 
diminished. In properly selected cases Creo- 
sote is an unequivocal and very decided ad- 
vance in the treatment of phthisis. Many 
patients take one hundred minims daily, 
without repugnance or discomfort. 

Doctor Mulhall begins with three drops 
three times daily, and increases the dose as 
rapidly as the patient can bear it. It should 
never be administered on an empty, nor as a 
rule to a disordered, stomach— it should be 
an invariable rule to secure good digestion 
before administering a drug for the relief of 
a cough of any kind, and often one finds by 
the time the tongue is clean the cough has 
disappeared. Creosote is best administered 
dissolved in whiskey, the preparation taken in 
milk or well diluted with water. A trifle of 
whiskey helps digestion and dissolves the 
creosote thoroughly; and milk or glycerin 
added prevents it from irritating. — St. Louis 
Clinique. 



Chronic Morphinism. — Obersteiner individ- 
ualizes the treatment of the morphine habit. 
He suggests beginning with the average 
daily dose, and withdrawing the dose as rap- 
idly as the patient can bear. When the dose 
has been reduced to a few centigrammes, 
caution is necessary, as then even a slight re- 
duction is badly borne, and at this stage 
warm baths of from five to fifteen minutes' 
duration, followed if necessary by the cold 
shower or cold pack from one-half to two 
hours (temperature from 78 to 86° F.), are 
often of benefit. Alcohol in liberal quanti- 
ties is often needful. 

Regarding cocaine he declares that in 
treating the morphine habit it has no other 
use than to modify the symptoms and should 
only be employed when these become vio- 
lent, say twenty-four to forty-eight hours 
after the last dose of morphine — and should 
always be given by the mouth in doses of 
three-quarters to one-and-a-half grains, never 
exceeding seven grains per day. Moreover, 
this should be steadily reduced, and never 



continued longer than five or six days. Nu- 
trition must be improved by all possible 
means. If collapse occurs, morphine must be 
resorted to. Patients with cardiac trouble 
should not be subjected to complete with- 
drawal. — Wiener Medizinische Presse. 



Little Known Properties of Chloral. — Doctor 
Holstein calls attention to the value of Chlo- 
ral as a relaxant of smooth muscular fibre and 
a dilator of peripheral vessels. He employs 
combined with iodide of scdium or potassium 
in bronchial asthma and haemoptysis, where 
it acts by dilating the peripheral vessels. — 
Cherchevsky, Rokitansky, Paul and others 
have'likewise recommended Chloral in con- 
nection with iodide in doses of two to three 
grains several times a day, and believe the 
Chloral materially favors the action of the 
latter. 

Holstein also employs in minute doses in 
treating the coldness of feet of the anaemic, 
chloro anaemic, and neuropathic subjects. 
He likewise finds it of great service in the 
chronic constipation of neurasthenics, which 
is generally so rebellious to treatment. The 
laxative dose is about one scruple taken be- 
fore retiring, and its action is in general quite 
persistent, in some instances lasting several 
days. Like most drugs prescribed for this 
symptom, it is only to be employed occasion- 
ally, lest a habit be formed. — Revista Clinica 
e Terapeutica. 



Chronic Cocainism. — Investigations of Doc- 
tor J. B. Mattison, of Brooklyn, give evidence 
that some of the properties claimed for Coca 
and Cocaine are, to say the least, doubtful. 
As stimulants to the nervous and reproduc- 
tive systems both are failures — on the con- 
trary, they prove depressants. Further, un- 
der a continued use of the drug, temperament 
is modified — the patient becomes idle, unclean, 
selfish, and neglectful, and, in short, disturb- 
ances are induced that closely resemble those 
of the last stage of morphinism. 

In recent cases, he declares, the drug may 
be suppressed suddenly, the pain and insom- 
nia being combated by hypnotics, notably 
Lactophenin and Bromhydrate of Hyoscine. 
In cases of long standing it is better to dimin- 
ish the drug gradually and replace by hypo- 
dermatic injections of Benzoate of Caffeine. 



Cactus Grandifloru-s in Heart Disease. —

Calcium Chloride for Pneumonia. — In The 
Practitioner Doctor Crombie recommends the 
employment oi Calcium Chloride in five- to 
fifteen-grain doses every four hours in the 
treatment of lobar pneumonia. Of twenty- 
two cases treated, but one terminated fatally. 
They ran a mild course and were character- 
ized by subsidence of temperature almost to 
normal after the lapse of two or three days, 
and absence of distress and danger associated 
with high temperature. In several the dis- 
ease was arrested in the stage that it had 
reach:d at the time treatment was instituted. 
In explanation of the action of Calcium 
Chloride, it is suggested it may neutralize the 
toxic action of peptones or albuminoids cir- 
culating in the blood. 



Fluid Extract Cedron. — This drug will re- 
move the ecchymosis resulting from contused 
wounds quicker than any other remedy. A 
lady fifty years old was bitten on the upper 
eyelid by a large tarantula, and three-quarters 
of an hour later the eye was closed and the 
tissues around it of a dark livid hue. Appli- 
cation of a compress of several thicknesses of 
muslin saturated with fluid extract of Cedron, 
and internal administration of the drug in 
six-drop closer in water, relieved the swelling 
in less than an hour, and the discoloration 
(which extended far below the orbit) also 
speedily disappeared. I find the fluid ex- 
of Cedron one of the best dressings for 
contused wouiid&gt; Doi roR D. C. Benni m. 



Veratrum in Catarrhal Pneumonia — Doc- 
tor Sutliff, of Sacramento, California, believes 
there is no remedy more specific: for any dis- 
ease than Veratrum Viride in catarrhal pneu- 
monia in children. He does not, however, 
believe the remedy has the same effect on 
other forms of pneumonia, and thinks to this 
is probably due the fact that it has some- 
times received unlimited praise and at others 
overwhelming condemnation. He adminis- 
ters in small and oft-repeated doses until the 



pulse is reduced and respiration low 
usually employs in the form &lt;&gt;f tincture, 
combining with sweet spirit of nitre and 

syrup of yerba santa 



Strophanthus. — This drug is both valuable 
and safe. It is a cardiac tonic, a diuretic, and 
quicklyrel rdial pain and dys] 

The tincture is the best preparation, and 
should be given in small (two minims) &lt; 
gradually increased and combined with stimu- 
lants and antispasmodics, such as ammonia 
and ether It is most useful in aortic re- 
gurgitation, as its power of lengthening 
diastole is not so great as that of digitalis, 
nor has it so marked a cumulative action; 
and any danger which may lurk in its ad- 
ministration is considerably lessened by its 
combination with ether. — Do&lt; rOF TAYLOR, 
in Medical Rt 



Uva Ursi. — There are other purposes for 
which Uva Ursi may be advantageously used 
than those pointed out in the therapeutics of 
the day. For instance, in a case of tardy labor 
from inertia it is a better remedy than ergot. 
For this purpose I use a strong decoction of 
the leaves, and give freely. It is better than 
ergot to arrest flooding in nearly every case. 
In both labor and haemorrhage where such 
remedies as ipecac, gelsemin, bugle weed, 
etc., are sometimes employed, try the Uva 
Ursi alone. I have used it for nearly tw&lt; nty 
years in such, with but few failures.— DoCTOB 
J. Davis, in American Medical Journal. 



Hyoscyamine in Retention of Urine. — Two 
years ago I attended a very severe case of 
typhoid fever in a patient twelve years of 
age, in which I was confronted with reten- 
tion of urine. To have applied the usual 
treatment (catheterization) would have re- 
quired an anaesthetic or strapping down. In 
my dilemma I thought of the relaxing effect 
of Hyoscyamine, and so gave every fifteen 
minutes until the desired effect was induced. 
I have since tried it in a number of cases, 
and though it requires four or five doses I 
never failed to relieve the patient. — 1 )OCTOF 
J. H. FRETZ, in Medical World. 



Yeast and Polls. — I )octor Debouzy declares 
that the administration of two to three tea- 
spoonfuls of brewer's Yeast during the- twenty- 
four hours, mixed with beer and taken before 
eating, is an effective remedy for both car- 
buncles and boils. In cases of repeated crops 
of furuncles it may happen that new ones

appear, but they are readily aborted by this 
treatment, which should in such cases be 
prolonged for a fortnight. The only incon- 
venience arising from the use of the yeast is 
diarrhoea, and this is not often produced. — 
Lyon Medical. 



Dysmenorrhea. — In the Therapeutische Mo- 
natshefte, Doctor Schwarze discusses this 
condition when associated with ante- and 
retro-flexion of uterus, and lays special stress 
upon the value of gymnastics and massage; 
he however remarks that the latter is not 
available in well developed non-anaemic 
women. Also in non-inflammatory cases, 
Liquor Sedans gives brilliant results which 
are not to be obtained with any other rem- 
edy. He recommends a teaspoonful three 
times a day, given five to seven days before 
menstruation. 



Pernicious Ancemia. — According to Doctor 
Stengel, Arsenic is almost a specific, and 
best given in the form of Fowler's solution 
beginning with two-drop doses, rapidly in- 
creasing to ten drops, and then more slowly 
to fifteen or more; it should always be given 
after meals. Gastric disturbance more fre- 
quently subsides than becomes aggravated 
from its use. Under no circumstances, how- 
ever, should the remedy be pushed so far as 
to induce diarrhoea. A valuable adjunct to 
the treatment is to confine the patient to bed 
and to nutritious and assimilable diet. 



Digitalis in Goitre. — The most efficacious 
medical treatment of goitre consists in the in- 
ternal administration of Digitalis and the local 
application of an iodide ointment. The goitre 
diminishes in size, and even disappears, with 
astonishing rapidity. The favorable action 
of Digitalis in hypertrophy of the thyroid is 
explainable by its influence on arterial ten- 
sion; but this employment of the drug is not 
new, as it originated with Doctor Murray in 
1776. — Medical Week. 



Alstonia. — Alstonia constricta is a cerebro- 
spinal stimulant and tonic, acting positively 
on the great sympathetic n'erve centres, and 
stimulating the vital forces of the entire sys- 
tem; as a nerve stimulant and tonic it can be 
given in doses of three to five grains (or three 
to five minims fluid extract) after meals and 
on retiring. Given in this way there is 
speedy response, the appetite, digestion, as- 
similation and circulation being wonderfully 
improved. — Chicago Medical Times. 



Pilocarpine in Rheumatism. — Though sodi- 
um salicylate may be regarded as a specific 
in articular rheumatism, it sometimes causes 
toxic symptoms so grave as to render its use 
impossible. In one such case, a patient who 
suffered from two or three attacks of rheu- 
matism yearly, I used hypodermatic injections 
of Pilocarpine in one-sixth grain doses, which 
led to complete recovery within six days. — 
Doctor Drappier, in Universal Medical 
Journal. 



Treatment of Anal Fissure. — Doctor J. H. 
Yarnell suggests the treatment of fissure of 
the anus by means of pure Collodion applied 
directly to the open wound. Though the 
application causes intense momentary pain, 
this is quickly succeeded by a pleasant, com- 
fortable sensation. It contracts the part and 
acts as a protective, beneath which healing 
takes place rapidly. 



Mullein Oil and Cancer. — Doctor J. C. 
Wentz writes the Homoeopathic Recorder that 
Mullein Oil is not only the best possible 
dressing for burns, but when distilled by sun 
exposure it often checks the growth of cancer 
— it is not curative, but simply reduces the 
condition of the morbid growth to one of 
statu quo. 



Diabetes. — In Gazzetta Degli Ospitali, Doctor 
Leoni reports great satisfaction from the use 
of Jambul. He declares that the drug con- 
tains an active principle which, while not 
specific, is yet capable of neutralizing the 
diabetic process in individual cases. 



For Croup. — Two drops fluid extract Jabo- 
randi every hour will be found to afford 
material benefit. It is especially indicated in 
those susceptible to hoarse cough suggestive 
of croup on every change of the weather. — 
Medical Times. 



La Grippe. — Of all the remedies recom- 
mended for this malady The Practitioner de- 
clares the old-time Boneset tea (infusion of 
Eupatoriu?n perfoliatuni) will relieve more 
quickly and thoroughly than any other rem- 
edy. 



Gelsemium in Parturition. — Normal liquid 
Gelsemium is successful in affording relief in 
that condition of labor characterized by thick, 
rigid cervix with cutting abdominal pains. — 
Doctor Howell.

THE MEDICAL AGE. 



Medical Progress. 



Has i in- West ro Li \ 

Mi i&gt;! m ihi BAST? — History tells us 

that when most of the pi 

:&gt;e were only In a primitive State of cul- 
ture, India was renowned for its grandeur in 
science and literature, and thai the Indians 
ed in the " art of medicine," which lat- 
ter was borrowed by the Arabs, who trans- 
I a portion of their acquired knowledge 
to the Greeks, who in their turn imported it 
into the rest of Europe. 

As a natural consequence of the various 
invasions and frequent change of rule, India 
has lost a great deal of her literature, while 
from one cause and another, and the desire 
to ape the customs and ordinances of the 
various conquerors, many of the arts have 
sunk into oblivion or disuse, as Oriental re- 
searches have frequently shown. 

In ancient medical works we find the terms 
I \ii i \d, Bhishaka % and D liana: antari, respec- 
. applied to physicians who knew of one, 
two, or three hundred remedies for any one 
disease; and this, coupled with the fact that 
many persons discharged from hospitals as 
" incurable " have found relief and perma- 
nent benefit from native medication, would 
go to show that there is something for the West 
to learn from the East, and that the Phar- 
macographica Indica is not to be despised or 
regarded as worthless, simply because many 
of our indigenous medical practitioners have 
gleaned their little knowledge from British 
works. 

Compared side by side, we cannot but be 
astonished to find that though it is very ex- 
plicit and exhaustive in its description of 
therapy and physiological action, still the 
non-official drugs bear a very small relation 
to the official preparations; and British phar- 
macy is far more limited than is Indian 
pharmacy, with its numberless drugs and 
huge variety of metallic preparations, whose 
combination with vegetable elements gives 
them not only a greater scope for medical 
employment but less risk of accumulative 
virulence. 

Were British and native diplomates of the 
English system of training only to take the 
trouble to apply to Indian drugs a tiny share 
of the attention they have paid to studying 
British pharmacy, they would much sooner 
gain the confidence of India's laboring classes 
and get far better results than it is possible 
to obtain by steadfastly adhering to the ad- 
ministration of drugs whose physiological 
properties were chiefly tested in those coun- 
tries where the climate and other life condi- 



tions are a long way different to th&lt;&gt; 
India. 

\jt cannot compete 

r equal the surgery of the West, 
still we have amongst the non-diplomaed 
practitioners of tl who 

made ophthalmia and other 
Specialty, and have performed both major 
.\\\(\ minor operations so successfully that 
native patients flock to them in preference to 
attending charitable medical institutions; and 
just to show how clev' men 

are. I will quote three among many instances 
that came within my personal observation: 

i. Noticing a tailor of about seventy years 
of age, with extensive cataract of both eyes, 
plying his needle as vigorously as anyone 
with sound eyesight could, I suggested op- 
erative intervention to prevent his entirely 
losing his sight; but to my surprise he said: 
"I am now seventy-two years of age, but my 
sight began to fail me at the age of forty, 
and yielding to the entreaties of some of my 
friends I consulted a quack oculist who told 
me that though my eyes were unfit for direct 
operation he could arrest the further progress 
or development of the cataracts. He then 
cut away a portion of the flesh from the inner 
surface of the upper lids of both eyes. The 
wounds healed within a fortnight, and from 
that time up to the present there has been 
no change for the worse." I carefully ex- 
amined this artificial depression in each of 
the upper lids, and would very much like to 
know what relation exists between these de- 
pressions and the cataracts. 

2. A boy, whose intestines were protruding 
through an abdominal wound, was brought to 
a certain civil surgeon, who was unable to 
reduce the rupture. A kobiraj (call him quack, 
if you like) offered the boy a pinch of strong 
snuff which he desired him to inhale with a 
long inspiration. The boy did so, and, the 
effort retracting the protruding bowel, it 
only remained for the civil surgeon to close 
up the wound. Perhaps you will say this 
was only a matter of common sense. Granted, 
but it required judgment and presence of 
mind to know when to apply it. 

3. A rich merchant of Berar took his son, 
who was afflicted with urinary calculus, from 
hospital to hospital; but as the boy appeared 
to be too emaciated and too weak to be able 
to stand chloroform, no surgeon would con- 
sent to the responsibility of an operation. In 
despair the father sought the services of a 
kobiraj, who agreed to do the needful cutting 
provided the father gave him a document 
completely exonerating him from blame in 
the event of the boy succumbing to operative 
measures. Putting the lad under the influ-

G3 



ence of Cannabis indica, the kobiraj incised the 
bladder, and after removing a stone, weigh- 
ing nearly one ounce, filled up the wound 
with some sort of green ointment. Perfect 
healing occurred in twenty-two days. 

It is far from difficult to multiply instances 
of the above kind where native and Ayurvedic 
medication have given excellent results; but 
I exceedingly regret to note that while many 
of the European practitioners in India are 
turning a close attention to the investigation 
of the intrinsic merits and claims of Indian 
drugs, there are few indeed of the native 
practitioners who will, enter upon this field of 
scientific research, and fewer still who will 
take the trouble to record their experiences 
or publish them for the benefit of their fellow 
practitioners. 

There is not a single race or caste of In- 
dians but has its medical practitioners, both 
university trained and Ayurvedic, and in every 
Indian tongue are to be found books and 
literature and traditions treating on the in- 
digenous drugs of India and their various 
compounds and preparations; and we note 
that in those portions of this country which 
are almost exclusively inhabited by Indians 
there is next to no encouragement for those 
practicing the British system of medicine, for 
the simple reason that the majority of the 
races of India are too superstitious to take to 
a new system of treatment, and have not the 
inclination nor the faintest desire to abandon 
their hakims, kovirajcs, etc., from whom they 
have derived great benefit, and many of 
whom are exceptionally clever: thus showing 
that if Eastern medicine were really as use- 
less as it is sometimes accused of being, 
British medicines would have come into much 
greater favor than they at present obtain in 
this country, and similarly we are justified in 
maintaining that the West has something to learn 
from the East as regards medicine and drugs. 

Among Indian works on drugs, those of 
Charaka, Shushruta and Wag Bhatta claim 
especial attention, as they contain descrip- 
tions, etc., of drugs that would make a valu- 
able addition to the British Pharmacopoeia, 
and are quite worthy of being brought before 
the notice of a joint committee composed of 
picked British and native practitioners from 
all the presidency districts. If the Govern- 
ment of India could only see its way to 
elucidating these points and encouraging a 
proper study of Indian drugs, it would confer 
an inestimable boon on the public of India 
by opening up the way to reviving ancient 
literature and stimulating scholars to dili- 
gently search and wisely interpret old but 
really valuable works and records that have 
too long been neglected or ignored. 



With the starting of medical magazines 
in India we had hope of their being used 
as the means of introducing native drugs 
to the notice of the medical profession as 
a whole; but our hopes are doomed to dis- 
appointment, as there is no medical journal 
extant in which may be recorded or pub- 
lished the pharmacology of Indian drugs or 
the results from the administration of them.* 
Fate, unkind Fate, thus deprives us of much 
that might have proved useful and which, 
with the modern light of perfected science 
thrown on them, would surely have proved 
of inestimable value to medical practitioners 
of all creeds and denominations. — R. At- 
maram, C.M.S., in Indian Medical Record. 



Astigmatism as a Factor in Causation 
of Myopia. — In the majority of cases myopia 
is a disease of the eyeball of more or less 
gravity — a disease which not only diminishes 
sight, but tends to destroy it through organic 
changes in the sclerotic, choroid, vitreous, 
lens, etc.: 

Myopia cannot be cured — its treatment is 
limited to the restriction of its development, 
the curbing of its ravages, and the correction 
of its disabilities: 

It is induced, usually, by the efforts of the 
eye to perform its work when crippled by 
astigmatism; accessory factors in the causa- 
tion of myopia include all conditions which 
make it more difficult for the eye to see 
quickly and accurately, or which impair the 
nutritive supply: 

Eyes normal in structure do not become 
myopic under the strain incident to life in 
the schools, or in business or professional 
pursuits; nor do they suffer from asthenopia, 
or interfere with the functions of the nervous 
system or any other apparatus in the body: 

The prevention of myopia depends mainly 
upon the early correction of defects of struc- 
ture, and the continuance of this correction 
at least throughout the period of actual 
growth; to this it is wise to add such other 
conditions as will to the largest degree re- 
strict eye-strain: 

The most effective method of eliminating 
myopia from the race is the requirement of a 
physician's certificate of physical soundness 
from all who seek an entrance to the public 
schools, said certificate to include a correc- 
tion of all astigmatic defects. — Doctor 
Leartus Connor, in American Lancet. 



*A slight misconception, as our own columns 
have always been open to pharmacology, thera- 
peutics, etc., and we would be glad to disseminate 
the knowledge our contributor complains of the lack 
of.— Ed. /. M. R.

Ocular Ballottement. — The diagnosis 
of fluid vitreous with floating opacities may 
be aided by a method not laid down in text- 
books. The retinoscopic mirror is used in 
the same way as in indirect ophthalmoscopy. 
The patient has to be "trained" or carefully 
instructed in order to carry out the manipu- 
lation rightly, the essential point of which 
consists in halting a downward sweep of the 
eye suddenly and at such a point that the 
oculist can have a good view of the post- 
pupillary field. Direct the patient to look 
up to the ceiling and then to swiftly look at 
an object in front and on a line horizontal 
with the eyes, holding the gaze steadily there. 
If opacities floating in a fluid vitreous exist, 
this sudden "flip" of the vitreous chamber 
upward, followed by sudden stoppage, flings 
the opacities upward, and with the ophthal- 
moscopic mirror they will be seen again to 
descend like snow-flakes falling outside of a 
window in the night. This method of diag- 
nosis might appropriately be named ocular 
ballottement. — Medical Ntlk 's.

children (of normal weight and appearance) 
at proper term. The boy was born alive

ASignoi h Presentation. — When, 

in a woman who has passed the sixth month 
of pregnancy, a sharp pain is produced by 
placing the hand on the fundus uteri, it may j 
be almost affirmed that there is a breech I 
presentation. The fact is very frequent, j 
although not constant, being present in j 
about seventy per cent, of cases. The pain 
is sometimes spontaneous. How is it to be 
explained ? According to Pinard, it is due 
to the irregular distention produced by the 
rounded mass of the head. If version be per- 
formed, the pain disappears. — La Clinique In- 
ternal. 



Conception in a Woman with Ovarian 
Tumor. — Opinion is divided as to whether 
an ovarian tumor is hastened or retarded in 
its growth by pregnancy. Sixty per cent, of 
labors end normally in the presence of an 
ovarian tumor. But Heilberg's statistics 
show that sixty-seven per cent, of the infants 
die, hence obstetricians are encouraged to 
more frequent recourse to ovariotomy. Ols- 
hausen's record of results of ovariotomy in 
pregnant women shows a mortality of only 
9.8 per cent. — about the mortality in general 
ovariotomies. — Doctor A. R. Simpson, in 
Edinburgh Medical Journal.

chives de Physiologic Normale et Pathologi&lt;/ue) f 
as the result of personal investigation, arrives 
at the conclusion that urea exists in all of 
the tissues of the mammalian organism, and 
in greater proportion than in the blood. The 
production of urea is participated in by all of 
the tissues, although in varying degree, the 
liver being the most active seat of formation. 
— The production seems due to processes of 
denutrition that take place in various tissues, 
and results especially . from the work per- 
formed by the liver.

LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF MEDI= 
CINE.* 

BY ROSWELL PARK, A.M., M.D. 

(Copyrighted.) 

[Continued from page 44.] 

The Arabic Period, which began with the 
second destruction of the Alexandrian Li- 
brary, 640 a.d., ends with the fourteenth 
century. At the commencement of this 
period the Roman Empire of the West scarce- 
Jy existed: the magnificent territory which 
composed it had been overrun and subdued 
by barbarous tribes from the forests of the 
North, while from its ruins had risen several 
independent kingdoms — that of the Franks 
in Gallia, of the Visigoths in Spain, and of 
the Lombards in Italy. The last of the 
Western emperors of note was Justinian, 
whose army and generals— especially the 
genius and heroic devotion of Belisarius — 
threw some glory upon Italy, Sicily, Africa, 
and Spain. Meantime the Empire of the 
East, surrounded by enemies, and harassed 
from all directions, still sustained itself with 
vigor. The Turks had begun to show them- 
selves on the banks of the Danube; those 
eternal enemies of Rome, the Persians, made 
incessant war; and a new and terrible enemy 
had sprung up in the deserts of Arabia. 
Then came one who was at the same time 
legislator, prophet, and conqueror, and united 
under one faith and one leader tribes hitherto 
divided and warring against each other. 
Thus arose a powerful and enthusiastic na- 
tion, animated by thirst for conquest and 
ardor for proselytism. In less than a century 
after the first preaching of Mahomet, all of 
Arabia, India, Syria and Egypt were in the

hands of his followers. In the year 640 
Amrou effected the conquest of Egypt, seized 
Alexandria, and the great library of 500,000 
volumes was, by order of Omar (successor to 
Mahomet), delivered over to the flames; 
and the historian Abulpharagius declares 
that these books served for six months to 
heat the public baths, 4,000 in number. Such 
were the first fruits of the establishment of 
Islam.* Happily, zeal of proselytism some- 
what abated among the Mussulman princes, 
and religious fervor gave place to policy, so 
that the later Arabian caliphs showed them- 
selves in general the protectors of the arts 
and sciences. Some, indeed, endeavored to 
collect the debris of the scattered treasures 
that had been so fortunate as to escape the 
ignorant fanaticism of their predecessors; and 
others, more tolerant even than the Christian 
princes of the time, received without distinc- 
tion all men of merit who took refuge in 
their State, gave them employment, and rec- 
ompensed them for their services. On this ac- 
count philosophers and persecuted "heretics" 
sought an asylum among infidels, and found 
there the protection which Christianity did not 
afford — in return for which they gave their 
protectors the benefits of Greek civilization. 
Of all the Moslem rulers, the most dis- 
tinguished for love of learning and general 
enlightenment was Haroun-al-Raschid, the 
Charlemagne of the East, contemporary and 
emulator of the glory of the emperor of 
the Franks, the hero of a hundred Arabic 
poems, whose dominion extended from the 
borders of the Indus to the heart of the 
Spanish Peninsula. He embellished Bagdad, 
his capital, with schools and hospitals. His 
son Almamon founded the Academy of Bag- 
dad, which became the most celebrated of

countries. He enjoined each of his ambas- 
sadors to pni I the writings of the 
philosophers and phys - that could be 
found, and these he required to be translated 
into Arabic; — his interpreter, Honain, a 
Christian, was employed at translating for 
forty- five years, and received for each book 
rendered into Arabic, literally its weight in 
gold. 

The eclat which the Moorish caliphs shed 
upon Spain from the tenth to the thirteenth 
century is well known. The cities of Cor- 
dova, Toledo, Seville and Murcia 
public libraries and academies, and students 
from all parts of Europe flocked to them to 
be instructed in arts and sciences; the library 
of Cordova alone embraced more than 224.000 
volumes. Thus it will be seen that the do- 
minion of mental and temporal affairs passed 
from the (i reeks and Romans to the Sara- 
cens. 

Arabian medicine constitutes one of the 
most interesting chapters in the history of 
our art. An offspring from Greek schools, it 
was for nearly one hundred years the foster- 
mother of that art, and although it gave rise 
to no great discovery nor wonderful step in 
advance during all this period, it nevertheless 
kept alive all the learning of the past and 
clarified rather than made it turbid. In the 
sixth century the Nestorians (followers of 
Bishop Nestor), having been driven out of 
Syria, settled in Persia, Mesopotamia, and 
Arabia, and there founded schools and other 
institutions such as they had had at home — 
schools in which, beside the ordinary philo- 
sophic studies, medicine received a share 
of attention. Thus it came about that by 
the seventh century Arabian physicians were 
everywhere known and in high repute. Nat- 
urally the basis for their studies embodied 
the writings of Hippocrates, Galen, Onbasius, 
and Paul of yEgina; and the first Arabian 
works consisted solely of translations from 
the Greek, first out of their Syriac rendering, 
and later from the originals. Indeed, so 
much eminence was finally achieved by 
Arabian physicians that more than four 
hundred are known by name as authors.

Serapion, the elder, also sometimes known 
as Janus Damascenus, and whose Arabic 
name was Serafiun, was born in Damascus — 
the exact date is not known, —and died soml 
time prior to a d. 930. He was author of 
two volumes of aphorisms concerning the 
practice of medicine, which had at his time 
the greatest repute. 

The most celebrated of the early Arabian 
physicians was Rhazes, born in the Persian 
province of Khorassan, a.d. 850. According 
to the historians of his nation he was a uni- 
versal genius, equally famous in music, as- 
tronomy, mathematics, chemistry, and medi- 
cine; he was surnamed "The Experienced. 
At the age of fifty he was one of the most 
distinguished professors in the Academy of 
Bagdad, where students came from great dis- 
tances to listen to him. Chosen from am &lt;ng 
a hundred colleagues to direct the grand 
hospital of that city, he displayed indefatiga- 
ble zeal and most scholarly learning, even to 
his old age and in spite of loss of sight, which 
overtook him at the age of eighty when his 
reputation was at its height. Two years after 
this misfortune (/'. f., in 932) he died. H s 
generosity, which was proverbial, and his 
compassion for the poor, left him penniless 
at the time of his death. Sonic 237 mono- 
graphs of his have been catalogued, though 
the greater number of his works are prac- 
tically lost. Two treatises on medicine re- 
main which afford excellent counsel in many 
respects; among other matters he advises: 



THE MEDICAL AGE.

Study carefully the antecedents of the man 
to whose care you propose to confide all you 
have most dear in this world, that is, your 
life and the lives of your wife and children. 
If the man is dissipated, is given to frivolous 
pleasures, cultivatrs with too much zeal the 
arts foreign to his profession, still more if he 
be addicted to wine and debauchery, refrain 
from committing into such hands lives so 
precious. 

His greatest publication was "Continent" — 
extracts compiled from all authors for his 
own use, — divided into thirty-seven books, 
constituting an abridgment of the science of 
medicine and surgery up to his time; and 
notwithstanding its imperfect state, this work 
was held in greatest reverence and was a com- 
mon source of knowledge among Orientals, 
long after his day. 

Haly-Abbas, a Persian by birth, flourished 
fifty years after Rhazes, and died a.d. 994. 
His " Ahthdeki" in twenty volumes consti- 
tuted a quite complete system of theory and 
practice of medicine, which however was in 
large measure taken from Rhazes' " Conti- 
nens" It is generally regarded as the best 
! work of any of the physicians of the Arabic 
j Period; it is divided into three parts — a book 
I on Health, a book on Death, and a book of 
' Signs; and it is interesting to know that the 
portion devoted to midwifery and obstetrics 
was in the hands not only of the profession, 
but also of the midwives. 

Avicenna — Latinized form of his Arabic 
name, Ebn Sina — was born in Bokhara, in 
980. From his earliest youth he manifested 
a remarkable disposition for scientific study, 
I and it is claimed that he mastered the entire 
Koran at the age of ten years; also that he 
devoted his entire days and the greater part 
of his nights to research, mastering philoso- 
phy, mathematics, astronomy, and, later, 
medicine, which he studied at the university 
at Bagdad, in which city his talents were 
chiefly exhibited. He was received at court, 
'loaded with favors, and elevated to the 
[ : dignity of Vizier, but suddenly fell into dis- 
r grace, was deprived of property, imprisoned, 
land even threatened with execution. After 
1 two years, however, he was restored to liberty, 
and once more possessed the consideration of 
■ the public and the court, becoming the recip- 
ient of new honors. Meantime he had given 
himself up to intemperance, by which his pre- 



viously robust constitution was undermined, 
and this with excessive labor brought about 
his demise at the too early age of fif cy-six, in 
the year 1037. He was the author of several 
books, the chief being the " Canon Medicines" 
which remained a classic for six centuries, 
constituting the medical code of Asia and 
Saracenic Europe; no author since Galen 
had enjoyed so wide and extensive authority 
in the medical world; and in the various med- 
ical schools professors for the most part con- 
fined themselves to reading the " Canon " 
from their desks, explaining and comment- 
ing upon its text. The work was divided 
into five volumes, of which the first two com- 
prised the principles of physiology, pathology, 
hygiene, and therapeutics, arranged to con- 
form to the teachings of Aristotle and 
Galen; the third and fourth dealt with treat- 
ment; and the fifth was devoted to the prep- 
aration and composition of remedies. Avi- 
cenna appears to have surpassed in subtlety 
both Aristotle and Galen; he was fond of 
metaphysical speculation, and his works were 
too much filled out with subtleties of language 
rather than with true science. Authors of 
this period were fond of torturing in every 
way possible the writings which they un- 
dertook to edit or quote from, and instead 
of .devoting themselves to original research, 
wasted time in seeking for vague and hidden 
meanings. That man was most esteemed as 
learned who could see the greatest subtlety 
in some passage from one of the ancient 
writers; consequently that which was obscure 
or unintelligible was deemed the most sub- 
lime and philosophic. A very brief study of 
the "Canon" for instance, will show this; and 
in graphic pictures of disease the work by no 
means approaches those of Aretaeus or Alex- 
ander of Tralles, for Avicenna too often con- 
tented himself with mentioning merely a list 
of symptoms without indicating in any way 
their progression, characters, or duration. 
Undoubtedly just was the criticism of an 
Arabian poet: " His philosophy had no sound 
foundation, and his medical knowledge availed 
him nought for the possession of personal 
health and long life." 

Albucassis was born in Zahra, near Cor-t 
dova, about the beginning of the eleventh cen-7 
tury, and is supposed to have died a.d. ii22 ? 
at the advanced age of 101. He was autho 1

of an abridgment, &lt;&gt;r compilation, devoted to 
the practice of medicine, the only novelty of 

which is a small portion I to gOTgi 

in which arc described certain instruments. 

He- 
ll, tiled briefly the methods of 
Operations; I have described all necessary 
instruments, and I present their forms by 
means of drawings; in a word, I have omitted 
nothing of what can shed light to the profes- 
sion. But one of the principal 
reasons why it is so rare to meet a successful 
surgeon is that the apprenticeship of this 
branch is very long, and he who devotes him- 
self to it must be versed in the science of 
anatomy of which Galen has transmitted us 
the knowledge. ... In fine, no one 
should permit himself to attempt this difficult 
art without having a perfect knowledge of 
anatomy and the action of remedies. 

Not a word is said about dissections, how- 
ever — from which we conclude they were not 
tolerated in his time. He resorted enthusi- 
astically to the cautery, and recommended it 
in spontaneous luxations and the commence- 
ment of curvature of the spine. He refers 
particularly to instrumental delivery and the 
extraction of the after-birth; and when speak- 
ing of fractures and dislocations, he remarks: 
" This part of surgery has been abandoned 
to men of vulgar and uncultivated minds, for 
which reason it has fallen into undeserved 
contempt." 

Avenzoar, born in 1 113 of a Spanish family 
which had many illustrious scions, was in- 
structed in medicine by his father, and ulti- 
mately achieved great celebrity throughout 
Spain and Africa; for a time he lived at the 
court of the Prince of Seville, loaded with 
honors and presents, and finally was made 
Vizier. Among other works he wrote a trea- 
tise on renal diseases, in which he outlined 
the treatment of calculus and described an 
operation therefor. He died in 1161. 

Averroes (as he is generally known, though 
his Arabic name was Aben Roschd) was born 
a.d. 1 1 66, in Cordova, where his father held 
official position. After being grounded in phi- 
losophy, mathematics, and other sciences, he 
became a pupil in medicine under Avenzoar. 
The greater part of his life was passed in 
Seville, where he was greatly esteemed and 
finally knighted. In 1195 he was called to 
w he court of the King of Spain and Morocco, 



in Cordova, where he received the 1 
honors — only, however, through some mis- 
understanding, to be I; but he soon 
recovered his former position aid dignities. 
He wrote extensively, not only on medicine 
but on philosophy, his writings taking through- 
out a more or Less I le 
died in imS, and from him descended a 
number of physicians who achieved more or 
less reputation. 

Maimonides was born in Cordova, \.i». 1 [35] 
He early devoted himself to the Talmud, and 
in his extended travels visited Jerusalem; he 
even founded a school of philosophy in the 
East, which, however, had only a brief ex- 
istence. He died in 1204. He ranked higher 
in philosophy than in medical art, and seems 
to have been imbued with the methods of 
his teacher, Averroes, and is generally re- 
garded as a theorist rather than as a practi- 
cal physician, although he wrote more or less 
on medical topics, and is particularly remem- 
bered for an essay upon poisons. He was 
about the last of the Arabians who deserve 
special mention. 

During the period which was nearing its 
close at the time of the death of Maimonides, 
the Arabs embraced with much ardor the 
study of medicine, and translated into their 
language nearly all the treasures that had 
been amassed by the Greeks; indeed, the 
preservation of many of the great writings 
which would otherwise have been lost is due 
solely to this fact. Strange to say, however, 
the Arabians neglected Latin authors, and 
apparently possessed no knowledge of Celsus 
or Ccelius Aurelianus. As religious preju- 
dices prohibited dissections, they were obliged 
to rely solely upon the anatomical descrip- 
tions of Galen, and succeeded in increasing 
the errors of the original by inaccurate trans- 
lations. So far as originality of observation 
goes, the Arabians were in most respects be 
hind the Greeks; nevertheless they were the 
first to differentiate eruptive fevers, to which 
the latter paid little or no attention. The 
Arabian school also supplied the knowledge 
of purgatives, such as cassia and mann* 
which replaced the drastics employed by th 
ancients; also the mode of preparation of 
syrups, tinctures, distilled waters, pomades, 
and plasters. 

While the Arabians were gradually rising 






THE MEDICAL AGE. 



69 



by their power, intelligence, and renown, the 
Greeks were declining in inverse ratio: the 
genius, courage and ancient virtues of the 
latter grew weaker and weaker until they 
seemed on the verge of extinction. In the 
medical history of these centuries, in all 
Europe not under Moslem rule, there was 
but one man entitled to mention as an author 
in medicine, viz., John Actuarius, the son of 
one Zacharia. He lived at the close of the 
thirteenth and the beginning of the fourteenth 
century; was employed at Constantinople, his 
surname being the honorary title of the court 
physicians. He is more commonly known 
as Zacharia. Of his life we know little, save 
that he wrote several volumes, for the most 
part abridgments or commentaries on the 
doctrine of Galen. He laid great stress on 
the theory of critical days, and sustained his 
views by astronomical hypotheses most ingen- 
iously combined. His was the first Greek 
work in which were mentioned the remedies 
introduced by the Arabians, yet he has not 
a word to say of variola, measles, spina ven- 
tosa, and other affections fully described by 
Arabic authors. He held remarkable views 
concerning the nature of man, whom he sup- 
posed to be formed by the union of two con- 
trary substances, the soul and the body; 
described somewhat elaborately an imaginary 
plexus of veins connected with the digestive 
organs, through which the animal spirits 
were elaborated and purified; also, and quite 
methodically for his age, he explained the 
functions of the animal economy and the 
aetiology of disease. 

While the clouds that befogged the study 
of medicine in the Empire of the East thus 
grew heavier and heavier, we must not be 
blind to the melancholy spectacle concerning 
the provinces composing the Empire of the 
West. Barbarians in swarms, from the for- 
ests of Germany and Scandinavia, had swept 
its various portions, pillaging, destroying, 
and reducing to slavery its inhabitants. In 
southern Europe everything was changed. 
Each generation witnessed some new and 
unheard-of invader who demanded his share 
of booty and renown, and left a track of des- 
olation behind him. There was a brief 
period of order when Charlemagne reunited 
under one dominion these divers races, and 
seemed to have resuscitated the Western 



Empire, but no sooner was he dead than its 
elements, being devoid of affinity, broke apart. 
Former vassals, no longer restrained by the 
firm hand of the Emperor, made common 
warfare against his successors and against 
each other, and for several ages there was 
nothing but a succession of wars and inva- 
sions. Feudalism gave some sort of charac- 
ter to this military anarchy by affording 
repose, and in a measure security, for those 
who had hitherto been trampled under foot, 
but learning and the sciences fell into com- 
plete neglect, and it was with great difficulty 
that a very small number of men found 
within the pale of the church a limited pro- 
tection that enabled them to devote them- 
selves to the study of medicine and ecclesi- 
astical law. Near the end of the eleventh 
century, however, the enthusiasm of the Cru- 
sades whetted anew the turbulent appetite of 
the Christian barons, and led these lords of 
western Europe, with their belligerent spirits, 
to the East, as a result of which, people hith- 
erto oppressed could breathe more freely. 
A few States recovered their independence; 
some semblance of law was established; 
municipal institutions were organized; and 
establishments consecrated to public use 
were founded and multiplied; finally in 
the course of the thirteenth and fourteenth 
centuries the cloud which covered the face 
of Roman Catholic Europe was in some 
measure dispersed, and men of talent, and 
even genius, began to appear upon the scene; 
everything about them being so obscure, 
they shone like stars in the firmament. In let- 
ters, for instance, there were Dante, Petrarch, 
Boccaccio; in mathematics, Leonard of Pisa, 
the first in Europe to understand and employ 
figures and algebraic characters, although 
Cuvier has claimed this distinction for Ger- 
bert, a Benedictine monk of the tenth cen- 
tury, who subsequently became Pope Sylves- 
ter II. At this time, although in scholastic 
estimation medicine, theology and philosophy 
alone were fit to entertain the human mind, 
the natural sciences were not without occa- 
sional representatives. Roger Bacon was 
three centuries in advance of scientific re- 
form, and endeavored to introduce experi- 
mental philosophy, and so fully convinced 
some of his auditors that they subscribed 
^2,000 sterling to provide for the expense 






THE MEDICAL AGE. 



of hia experiments; this was money m 
happily employed, since it m ^ible a 

number of important discoveries. It is said 

that Bacon knew the properties of COM 
and concave lenses, and was the first to con- 
ceive of the microscope and telescope; his 
astronomical knowledge led him to demand a 
reform in the calendar, which Gregory XIII. 
carried out three centuries later; he had 
knowledge of gunpowder and its etfects, and 
in tact the wizard of his day; but his 
boldness ami originality dre*- upon him the 
enmity of the church, by which he was perse- 
cuted and finally condemned to imprisonment 
for life upon a diet of bread and waer, 
although he was ultima'ely released, in 1266, 
by Pope Clement IV. He wrote extensively, 
but only fragments of his works exist, since 
the friars believed them tainted with witch- 
craft and prevented their publication. 

Before and during the time of Roger Bacon 
the philosophers were divided into two par- 
ties, which engaged in very unseemly and 
unphilosophic strife. One was termed the 
Realist, and believed with Plato that ideas 
are self-existent and independent of the mind, 
in other words veritable entities: The other, 
the Nominalist, held with Aristotle that gen- 
eral ideas are pure abstractions formed by 
the mind with the aid of sensations received 
from without, without which they could never 
exist — that is, if a being could be imagined 
without sensibilities and the power of sensa- 
tion, such being would be destitute of ideas. 
These two parties kept up a very active war- 
fare and enlisted the aid of both civil and 
ecclesiastical authorities, the result being 
persecution of each other and that general 
unsatisfactory conflict into which theology 
and metaphysical speculation always force 
those who indulge in them. 

Now regarding the condition of medical 
affairs in the Empire of the West: Down to 
the seventh century, in Rome, there were 
court archiaters who were attached to the 
retinues of the nobles, and in each large city 
popular archiaters formed a college charged 
with sanitary matters, the instruction and ex- 
amination of candidates, and gratuitous ser- 
vices to the poor. Although there is little 
definite information available, it is probable 
that after the ruin of Alexardria much the 
same medical organization obtained in those 



provii ontinued under the Greek 

pire at Constantinople. Under Arab 
we k: little of what rules or r&lt; . 

tions governed instruction in me 
its practice; and so soon as one of th&lt; 
countries fell under the rule of the Turks, all 
Scientific institutions seem to ha. ved 

or been discontinued — or. ites 

it: " If we may judge by what still exists to- 
day in this unfortunate country (Turkey), 
consumed by the power of ignorance and 
despotism, the most complete anarchy fol- 
lowed all older organizations." 

In southern Kurope, however, things had 
not gone on quite so badly, although at first 
barbarous invasion caused everywhere dis- 
order and confusion, and the Christian States 
of the Western Empire yet presented afier 
three or four centuries a chaotic condition 
of affairs. The ecclesiastical schools, which 
were under the care of the church, still pur- 
sued courses of literary and scientific instruc- 
tion; in the time of Charlemagne, for in- 
stance, the colleges of the cathedrals, and 
even some of the monasteries, taught medi- 
cine in a very limited way under the name of 
physics. — Thus all the liberal professions, 
that of medicine included, fell under the 
domination of the clerg), and priests, abbots 
and bishops became court physicians. The 
monks of Mount Cassin, of the order of St. 
Benoit, enjoyed for a long time a great repu- 
tation for medical skill; and among these in the 
tenth century was an abbot named Berthier 
Didier, who became Pope Victor III. towards 
the close of the eleventh century, and one Con- 
stantinc, surnamed the African. Of the ec- 
clesiastics who from the ninth to the eleventh 
century were distinguished by the knowl- 
edge of medicine, there were Hugues, abbot 
of St. Denis, physician to the king of France; 
Didon, abbot of Sens; Sigoal, abbot of Eper- 
nay; Archbishop Milo, etc. Even several 
religious orders of women undertook, to a 
certain extent, the practice of medicine, and 
Hildegarde, who was abbess of the convent 
of Rupertsburg, near Bingen, is credited with 
having written a treatise on materia medica. 
From the ninth to the thirteenth century 
the Jews shared with the clergy the monop- 
oly of the healing art. Many of these studied 
under Arabian physicians, and though the 
canons of the church forbade them to in any

way minister to the ailments of Christians, 
they were still called upon in time of need, 
and even in many instances had access to 
the palaces of archbishops, cardinals, and 
popes. 

The education of Christian priests and in- 
fidel practitioners embraced really very little, 
and consisted for the most part of knowl- 
edge of a few symptoms and possession of a 
few receipts; books were excessively rare 
and expensive, capable teachers lacking, and 
a good medical education out of the question. 

| There was no law nor public regulation which 
concerned the practice of medicine, and any 
who desired could enter upon it; and besides 

i the priests and the Jews — which latter stood 
at the top of the scale — there was a multitude 
of charlatans of the lowest order, such as 
barbers, keepers of baths, and even a few 
wonen. The morality of this vulgar herd 
was on a level with its knowledge. I have 
said the practice of medicine was not regu- 
lated by law, yet Theodoric, King of the Visi- 
goths, enacted a statute that no physician 
should bleed a woman of noble birth without 
the assistance of a relative or domestic; that 
if a physician in treating a patient or dressing 
a wound happened to harm a gentleman he 
should pay a forfeit of ioo sous, and if the 
patient died from the operation he should be 
handed over to the relatives of the deceased, 
who could do with him whatever they pleased; 
but if he crippled or caused the death of a 
serf, he was to be held accountable only for 
the loss, and compelled to supply another — 
this remained in force from the sixth to the 
twelfth century, and was made to apply 
chiefly to the practice 01 surgery, which had 
been abandoned to individuals of the lowest 
condition. The practice of internal medicine 
was for the principal part the privilege of the 
clergy, and it is not likely the secular power 
ever expected that one protected with the 
title of priest should be handed over to the 
relatives of the dead. It furthermore appears 
that the practice of medicine as divorced 
from surgery led to such irregularities in the 
manners and conduct of the clergy that from 
the twelfth century popes and councils of the 
church repeatedly forbade the medical art to 
those in hoi) orders or under vows; but that 
this prohibition was often violated is shown 

I by the frequent reiteration of inhibitory laws. 



During the twelfth century the secular au- 
thority also was affected by abuses. Roger, 
founder of the kingdom of Sicily, one of the 
first Christian princes of the Middle Ages, 
gave special attention thereto, and in 1140 
proclaimed that every one who wished to 
practice medicine must present himself be- 
fore a magistrate and obtain authorization, 
under pain of imprisonment and confiscation 
of goods. Other sovereigns followed this 
example, and regulating ordinances were 
gradually established, which ultimately led 
to the institution of medical faculties and 
university degrees. 

During the Middle Ages, in the Empire of 
the West, arose the School of Salernum, 
which became so celebrated that, like that of 
Alexandria, it deserves special mention. The 
modern city of Salerno is situate on the 
Neapolitan Gulf, about thirty miles southeast 
of the city of Naples, with a population of 
but a few thousand souls. The ancient city 
stood upon a height in the rear of the present 
town, where the ruins of its mediaeval citadel 
are still to be sten. It first appeared in his- 
tory 194 b.c, when a Roman colony was 
founded; was a municipal town of importance, 
and appears even at this early day to have 
been a health resort, since Horace informs us 
he had been advised to substitute its cool 
baths for the warm ones of Baiae. During 
the stormy centuries following the downfall 
of the Western Empire, Salerno successively 
submitted to the sway of the Goths, Lom- 
bards, Franks, Saracens, and Greeks, as the 
vicissitudes of war compelled. Under the 
Lombards it became the residence of the 
Duke of Beneventum, and in 1075, when 
taken by Robert Guiscard of Normandy, it 
fell to the crown of Naples — in consequence 
of which, in the fourteenth century, the heir 
apparent of this kingdom took the title of 
Prince of Salernum. 

During the Middle Ages here flourished a 
medical school, important not alone because 
of its celebrity at the time, but for its effect 
upon the medical history of the future. Its 
origin is obscure, though it has been ascribed 
to Charlemagne in 802; again, its founding 
has been held to be the work of fugitives 
from Alexandria when that city was captured 
by the Saracens, 640 a.d.; some attribute it to 
the Benedictine order of monks, others to 



THE MKDICAL AGE. 



Sarao The foundation by Ale 

drian fugitives is probably conjectural, yet it 

must be admitted there e evidence of 

e of Arabian medicine m Salernum 

v as this. Be the origin what it may, 

ertain the Benedictine monks 
a very important influence upon this school, 
and there is considerable reason to think it 
was really originated by them. Their mon- 
astery of Monte Casino was located about 
fifty miles the other side of Naples, occupying 
the site oi an ancient temple of Apollo; the 
rules of the order enjoined the care of the 
sick and treatment by prayer, and St. Bene- 
dict himself was credited with performing 
miraculous cures. The rules which forbade 
public instruction were gradually discarded, 
for in the ninth century Abbot Bertharius 
wrote two books on the art of healing, and by 
the tenth century Monte Casino had acquired 
great reputation as a medical school and was 
sought by medically inclined monks from all 
quarters. A little later (1022) King Henry II. 
of Bavaria, Emperor of Germany, is said to 
have been cut for stone by St. Benedict him- 
self, who appeared in ghostly form and 
operated with such skill that on awaking the 
royal patient found the calculus in his hand, 
and only the cicatrix of the wound through 
which it had been removed. Of course the 
grateful Emperor could do no less than richly 
endow the monastery and bestow upon it ad- 
ditional privileges. 

Desiderius, the Benedictine abbot from 
1058 to 1086, and in the eleventh century 
promoted to the papal chair under the title 
of Victor III., was distinguished for his at- 
tainments in medicine and in music, and 
founded a new hospital in connection with 
the monastery; he also composed four books 
detailing the miraculous cures wrought by his 
patron saint. It was really within this mon- 
astery that Constantine the African, one of 
the most learned men and the most famous 
Christian physician of his time, compiled his 
numerous medical treatises. 

About Constantine there is much of ro- 
mance. He was born in Carthage in 1018, 
and died in 1085. He vis ted all the prominent 
schools of his day in Egypt, Bagdad, Baby- 
lon, and even India, and for thirty-nine years 
pursued the various branches of knowledge 
away from home. Returning to Carthage, 



misunderstood and feared, be w -ed of 

. and compelled to fly to 
save- his life. Disguised 

raped to Salernum, which had been recently 
captured by Robert Guiscard, and on the 
recommendation of some royal visitor, who 
had known him at another court, he 
made private secretary to Guiscard. His 
new duties BOOH became irksome, how 
and he retired to a cloister to devote himself 
to literary labors. These for the most part 
were translations of Greek and Arabic writ- 
ings, often made verbatim and without credit. 
Whatever may be said about this lack of 
honesty, and the barbaric nature of his Latin, 
credit must be given him for reviving the 
study of Hippocrates and Galen in France; 
and he is generally credited with being the 
first to introduce into Europe knowledge of 
Arabian medicine. 

From Monte Casino the Benedictines at 
an early day spread to Salernum, where by 
the middle of the tenth century three mon- 
asteries were established, in all of which were 
kept holy relics. It now appears that, al- 
though there may have been some previous 
institution of learning at this point, and pos- 
sibly even medical teachers, the real organ- 
ization of a regular school of medicine was 
due to the Benedictines. In the annals of 
Naples of the middle of the ninth century, 
the names of Salernian physicians are men- 
tioned; and it is known that toward the close 
of the tenth century Archbishop Verdun 
visited Salernum for relief from vesical cal- 
culus, and there died. A century later an 
elder son of Robert Guiscard was there 
treated for a wound received in fighting the 
Greeks. 

The earliest medical writings of this school 
which have been preserved are found in the 
Compendium Sakrnitanum, discovered in manu- 
script form in 1837; and among the more 
prominent authors quoted are: Pctronius, 
who wrote about 1035; Gariopontus, who 
wrote about 1040; Bartholomews, FerrariuA 
and Afflacius — the latter a disciple of Con- 
stantinus Africanus. 

The preaching of Peter the Hermit, which 
marked the close of the eleventh century, 
was followed by an outburst of crusading 
enthusiasm that quickly converted Europe into 
a vast camp, and Salernum, being situated

upon the high road to the East, was benefited 
in no small degree, and its reputation as a 
medical school materially enhanced; likewise 
its teachers gained in experience as regards 
military surgery. In this way it became a 
favorite resort for Crusaders when disabled, 
wounded, or diseased. Robert of Normandy, 
son of the Conqueror, returning from the 
Holy Land, remained here for some time 
with a poisoned wound in the arm, received 
in 1097 at the siege of Jerusalem, and it was 
decided it could be healed only by suck- 
ing out the poison, a process deemed danger- 
ous to the operator. History declares that 
Robert's wife, daughter of Geoffrey, Earl of 
Conversana, being denied permission, took 
advantage of her husband's unconsciousness 
during sleep to withdraw the poison, when 
the wound speedily healed. At the time of 
the departure of Robert, hastened by the 
death of his brother William, John of Milan, 
the then chief of the medical school, pre- 
sented him with the famous Regimen Sanitatis 
Salemiy said to have been composed largely 
for Robert's benefit. This was a Latin poem 
that enjoyed most unexampled popularity 
for many generations, and was the vade mecum 
of well educated physicians for centuries. It 
is said to have passed through 240 different 
editions, and that more than one hundred 
manuscript copies are to-day to be found in 
various European libraries. The latest Eng- 
lish version was published by Professor Or- 
dronaux in 187 1 — a sample is here sub- 
mitted: 

" Salerno's school in conclave high unites 
To counsel England's king; and thus indites: 
If thou to health and vigor would'st attain, 
Shun mighty cares, all anger deem profane; 
From heavy suppers and much wine abstain; 
Nor trivial count it after pompous fare 
To rise from table and to take the air. 
Shun idle noonday slumbers, nor delay 
The urgent calls of nature to obey. 
These rules if thou wilt follow to the end, 
Thy life to greater length thou may'st extend." 

During the twelfth and thirteenth cen- 
turies the glory of the School of Salerno 
reached its zenith; it was the most famous 
school of medicine in Europe, and was fostered 
by various kings. The celebrated Jew, Ben- 
jamin of Tudela, traveling from Spain to 
India, visited Salernum in 11 64 and called it 
the "principal university of Christendom." 



Early in the twelfth century flourished Cophon, 
Archimatheus, and Nicholas surnamed Prae- 
positus, all of whom were distinguished teach- 
ers. The latter published a work known as 
"Antidotarium" which was for several cen- 
turies the standard pharmacopoeia, and which 
contained a table of weights that correspond 
very closely to those of the modern apothe- 
cary. The younger Cophon, who has been 
confounded with his father (as both seem to 
have written extensively), wrote two treatises, 
one on the anatomy of the hog, the other en- 
titled "Ars Mede?idi." The first is interesting 
as the only anatomical treatise of this school 
which has been preserved, and is an index of 
the degradation of anatomical science of that 
time. 

The names of John and Matthew Platea- 
rius are of frequent occurrence in the records 
of this school, and have given rise to consid- 
erable confusion. The former is supposed 
to have been the husband of Trotula, a 
female physician of whom I shall have more 
to say later. 

Bernard the Provincial, who seems to have 
escaped the notice of most historians, wrote 
about 1 155, and his commentary offers much 
interesting information concerning the thera- 
peutics of the day; he formulated a large 
number of recipes to enable the sick to 
escape the omnipotence of the apothecaries, 
and recommended wine for the delicate 
stomachs of the more exalted of the clergy, 
and inasmuch as these stomachs did not bear 
medicine well, he directed, in accordance with 
the practice of Archbishop ^Efanus, that 
emetics should be prescribed after meals, 
when their action is less injurious and more 
agreeable; he advised young men and women 
tormented with love which they could not 
gratify, to tie their hands behind their backs, 
and drink water from a vessel in which a red- 
hot iron had been cooled. — Indeed, his work 
is full of curious information and advice, and 
is not without therapeutic interest. 

A name which figures largely in the history 
of this school is that of Magister Salernus, 
about which there is great uncertainty; it is 
not positively known whether this refers to a 
particular person or is a generic name cover- 
ing various individuals. The name has been 
mentioned as that of one of the four reputed 
founders of the school; it is positive there

certain treatises which bear this name—

In the latter half of the twelfth century 
lived John iA St. Paul, one of the teachers of 

G bert the Englishman; also Musandinus, 

who left a curious treatise on d and 

Urso, who wrote on the pulse and on the 
urme. Here in uoo resided and studied a 
certain Alcadmus from Syracuse, whose 
knowledge of philosophy and medicine was 
sueh that he acquired great reputation and 
w.is made a professor; he even composed 
Latin medical DOC 

lust at the close of this century flourished 
ji lius, who studied at Salernum, and also 
at Montpellier where a school of medicine had 
been founded in 11S0; he was physician to 
Philip Augustus of France, and became pro- 
fessor in the University of Paris. Three 
treatises, all in Latin hexameter, are ascribed 
to him. A contemporary was Johanes Rogeriis 
of Palermo, a graduate of Salernum and 
author of several works. 

Early in the thirteenth century flourished 
Roger of Parma, one of the most distin- 
guished of the alumni of this school, and the 
earliest pioneer in modern surgery — his 
work on this topic, familiarly known as 
Rogeriana, enjoyed the greatest reputation 
in its day and was for a long time the surgi- 
cal text-book of Italy; his predilection for 
poultices and moist dressings in the treat- 
ment of wounds, abscesses and ulcers be- 
came, in the hands of his successors, the 
distinguishing feature of the surgery of 
Salernum in opposition to the school at Bo- 
logna, where Hugo Di Lucca and Theodoric 
(his great rival) contended for the superior- 
ity of the dry treatment. Roger was also the 
first to use the term seton and to give practi- 
cal demonstration to this means of derivation. 
Roland of Parma, a pupil of Roger, and a 
surgeon of great distinction, became profes- 
sor at Bologna and wrote a treatise on 
surgery which was for the most part a com- 
mentary on the works of his master. The 
treatise of Roger and that of Roland fur- 
nished the basis for a work entitled " The' 
Treatise of the Four Masters" supposed to 
have been written about 1270, and manu- 
scripts of which have been long known in 
various European libraries. It is divided 



into four books. S no little SU1 

ability, ami from its title would appear to 
haw been the joint composition of four ; 
ers; indeed, it ifas long attribute h ma- 

theus, Platearius, Petro CelluS, and At:;. 
though it is now pretty generally understood it 
the product of but a single pen and its 
author most likely a !• renchman. The ascrip- 
tion of authorship to four masters was prob- 
ably for the purpose of increasing its weight 
and authority, and it constituted a reliable 
exposition of the surgery of Salernum in its 
day. It is quoted quite freely by Guy de 
Chauliac, who was the restorer of French sur- 
gery in the fourteenth century, and occasion- 
ally by later writers. 

Another of the distinguished Salernian 
physicians of the thirteenth century, one 
highly esteemed by Frederick II., was John 
of Procida, who also was active in pro- 
ducing—if not the real author of — the Mas- 
sacre of the Sicilian Vespers, a.d. 1282. 
In a dispute concerning the question of the 
two Sicilies he embraced the cause of P ince 
Manfred, for which he was banished by 
Charles of Anjou, and took refuge at the 
court of Peter III. of Arragon, by whom he 
was created a baron; and he was inlluential 
in persuading the latter to assert his claim to 
the throne of Sicily. By various intrigues at 
different courts he succeeded in organizing 
an alliance, which betrayed its existence in 
this massacre and finally resulted in the 
overthrow of the French in Sicily and the 
transfer of the Island to the ciown of Spain. 
He was author of at least two treatises de- 
voted to medicine and philosophy. 

Other writers of the School of Salernum 
were: a learned Jew of Agrigentum known 
as " Farragus;" Matthew Sylvaticus; Graph- 
aeus; and Cappola. About the middle of the 
fifteenth century flourished Saladino, famous 
as an authority on materia medica. 

It is of no small interest that now, for the 
first time in history, women began to figure 
somewhat prominently as writers, practi- 
tioners, and even teachers of medicine. About 
the middle of the eleventh century appeared 
a work entitled "-De Mulierium PassionibusA 
attributed to the before-mentioned Trotula, 
wife of John Platearius, which has descended 
even to these days. There is nothing in the 
work to indicate the name or sex of the

author, who is invariably spoken of in the 
third person, consequently Trotula's connec- 
tion therewith has often been disputed. It 
mentions a certain " aqua mirabilis" com- 
posed largely of brandy, which spirit is said 
to have first been employed medicinally by 
Thaddeus of Florence, who died in 1295; 
there is also an account of a patient who 
wore spectacles! The diseases of women and 
children are also largely dealt with. The 
work is undoubtedly an anonymous produc- 
tion of .the eleventh century, disfigured by 
additions of a later day, and ascribed to 
Trotula, perhaps because of the celebrity 
that attached to her; at all events it is the 
earliest work ascribed to a female physician, 
and thus possesses special claims to interest. 

Later we read of Sichelguada, wife of 
Robert Guiscard and a graduate of Salernum, 
who endeavored to poison her stepson Bohe- 
mond in order to secure the succession of her 
own child. This infamous plot was furthered 
by some of the Salernian physicians, and 
thwarted only by the prompt action of Guis- 
card, who swore he would slay his wife with 
his own sword should the malady of Bohe- 
mond prove fatal. 

Certain other female physicians of this 
period are mentioned, notably Abella, who, 
in spite of the modesty that is supposed to 
hedge about her sex, produced in Latin hex- 
ameter a work entitled " De Natura Seminis 
Hominis." Mercuriolus in the fifteenth cen- 
tury produced treatises on the cure of 
wounds, pestilent fevers, and on the nails. 
The most celebrated of all, however, appears 
to have been Calenda, who lived during the 
reign of that notorious profligate John II. of 
Naples (1414-1435), and was particularly 
distinguished for her personal attractions. 
She graduated with great honor from the 
school at Salernum, and soon after, in 1423, 
married a nobleman of the court, which per- 
haps accounts for the fact she never exer- 
cised the privilege of authorship. A little 
later, Marguerite of Sicily or Naples, also a 
Salernian graduate, acquired an extended 
professional reputation, and was licensed to 
practice by Ladislaus, King of Poland. 

Daremberg informs us there were numer- 
ous female physicians at Salernum, much 
sought after because of their talents, and 
moreover highly esteemed by the professors 



of the school who freely quoted the writings 
of their fair pupils and contemporaries; fur- 
ther, that they employed ointments in paral- 
yses, fumigations, vapors and antimony for 
coughs, and lotions of aloe and rose-water 
for swellings of the face; they combined 
scientific knowledge with facetious playful- 
ness in a manner peculiar to the sex, in that 
they tendered unsuspecting beaux bouquets 
of roses doctored with powdered euphorbium, 
and hugely enjoyed the forced sternutations 
of their victims. 

It will thus be seen what a widespread and 
long continued influence the School of Saler- 
num exerted. At first physics and philosophy 
were the principal branches taught, but later 
the other sciences were cultivated. The Em- 
peror Frederick II. united the different schools 
of the city into a university — a term, however, 
that, as then applied, appears to have cor- 
responded to what in the nineteenth cen- 
tury is understood by corporation. The Em- 
peror likewise published several decrees which 
revised the duties and privileges of practi- 
tioners of medicine and surgery in his king- 
dom, and, in 1224, ordered that no person 
should practice within the two Sicilies until 
examined by the faculty of the university and 
licensed at the royal hands; further, practi- 
tioners were compelled to devote at least one 
year to the study of anatomy. — The faculty 
at this time consisted of ten professors, whose 
salary probably depended upon the number 
of pupils. A candidate for graduation was 
required to present proof of majority, of 
legitimacy of birth, and of proper duiation of 
preliminary study, and then was examined 
publicly in the Synopsis of Galen, the Aphor- 
isms of Hippocrates, or the Canon of Avi- 
cenna. On passing he swore to conform to 
all the regulations hitherto observed in med- 
icine, to give gratuitous treatment to the poor, 
and to expose all apothecaries detected in 
adulterating drugs. A book was then placed 
in his hands, a ring upon his finger, and a 
laurel crown upon his head, when he was 
"dismissed with a kiss." The degree con- 
ferred was that of " Magister," the modern 
title of Doctor — at that period employed 
almost exclusively to designate a public 
teacher or professor. 

But the watchfulness of King Frederick 
was not confined to the regulation of medical

The earlier teachings and practice of Saler- 
num were a curious mixture of methodism, 
dogmatism, and superstition. The latter may 
be better understood when it is recalled that 
the practice of medicine for an extended 
period was confined almost exclusively to ec- 
clesiastics, who by their very education were 
prone to superstition and upheld the efficacy 
of charms and relics, and the active inter- 
vention of saints and martyrs as well as the 
myrmidons of evil; hence arose many of the 
conflicts and absurd notions peculiar to the 
period. The prevalence of the doctrine of 
medical methodism was due to the character 
of the writings most accessible to students of 
that day, such as of Ccelius Aurelianus and 
others; and it is curious that Celsus, the most 
elegant of medical authors, was never popu- 
lar among medical monks. The Hellenic 
language having almost disappeared from 
Italy by the sixth century, the works of the 
Greek authors had become a sealed book to a 
vast majority, even of the better educated, 
hence the purer sources of medical knowl- 
edge were not available. Although the School 
of Salernum at a later date prided itself upon 
its devotion to the "Father of Medicine," 
the Hippocratic writings were not known at 
this period; and when Constantine the Afri- 
can, by the translation of Arabic works, in- 
troduced a new element into the Salernian 
school, he engrafted upon its medical teach- 
ing a form of doctrine which found a congenial 
atmosphere in which it throve vigorously; 
while a century later the translations of Ge- 
rard of Cremona gave a stronger impulse to 
the growth of Hippocratic medicine than to 
Hippocratic doctrine. 

From the "Commentary of the Four Masters " 
we learn that Salernian practitioners recog- 
nized the diagnostic importance of nausea, 
vomiting, and the flow of blood from the ears 
in injuries to the head; that they resorted to 



the trepan for tares and the rew 

• intracranial extravasation; that hernia 
&gt;ri was treated by pressure and caustics; 
that ligatures, both above and below the 
opening, 1 plied for the treatment of 

wounds of the carotid arteries and jugular, 
veins. It \\\. d to decline patient! 

suffering from wounds of the heart, lungs, 
diaphragm, stomach, or liver, in order to 
avoid the disgrace of losing them: and in 
penetrating wounds of the intestines and 
those complicated with protrusion of the 
wounded gut, instruction was given how to 
envelop them in the warm abdomen of a 
slaughtered animal until natural color and 
temperature were restored, and then to insert 
a cannula of alder-wood into the wounded 
intestine, which was to be neatly closed and 
stitched; finally the protrusion was to be 
carefully washed with warm water and re- 
turned into the abdominal cavity, enlarging 
the opening for this purpose if necessary. 
Also was advised the extraction of diseased 
teeth; and the operation of lithotomy was 
described with considerable care. Compound 
fractures were to be treated with splints. On 
the whole this commentary of the alleged 
Four Masters is the most interesting and 
ancient Salernian work which has been pre- 
served, and is well worthy the attention of 
even modern surgeons. 

Such was the School of Salernum in its 
prime, during the twelfth and thirteenth cen- 
turies. My readers will not have failed to note 
how few names have been mentioned which 
are prominent in medical history, and how, 
few improvements were made in medical art 
by those who have been mentioned. Onei 
naturally inquires, then, what was the source; 
of the widespread fame of Salerno as a 
school, since it was distinguished neither by 
notable discovery in science nor by celebrated 
teachers, and the predominant element was 
doubtless one of obstinate conservatism and 
unswerving devotion to ancient doctrines. I 
Founded during the dark period of the Mid-i 
die Ages, at a time when ignorance, bigotry 
and superstition prevailed, it preserved amidst 
the gloom that had settled upon Europe a 
few rays of that intellectual light which had 
shone so brightly in the golden ages of Roman 
history. These rays, made more conspicuous 
by the intellectual night which they barely

illumined, were a beacon for men who were 
groping for more light. Thus the name of 
Salernum became synonymous with intellec- 
tual advancement in later ages. As the 
parent and model of our modern university 
system, Salernum yet deserves, in a measure, 
to enjoy the esteem of a numerous scholastic 
offspring. At a time when priests were par- 
ticularly active in passing off rudimentary 
knowledge for the science of healing, this 
school began to secure all information possi- 
ble from the laity for the progressive develop- 
ment of medicine. It began, in other words, 
to hold aloof, and then to break away from 
the fetters of a fanatical church. The de- 
cline, too, was as rapid as its career had 
been brilliant. One very serious blow was 
struck when, in 1224, Frederick II. founded 
the University of Naples and forbade Nea- 
politan subjects to seek instruction at any 
other university. The next year a revolt in 
the city provoked the closure of the schools 
of Bologna, which were, however, opened 
again two years later. Within a short time 
the universities of Naples, Montpelher, 
Padua, Paris and Bologna all entered into a 
contest for preeminence with a rivalry which 
was not always generous; in 1224, it is said, 
the latter university had no less than 10,000 
students. Happily, however, the period of 
the Renaissance proved to be one of emanci- 
pation from the fetters of ignorance and 
superstition, and an appeal for liberty which 
the conservatism of Salernum could not 
brook. Roger Bacon in England, Lanfranc 
and Guy de Chauliac in France, Mondino at 
Bologna, Savonarola at Padua, found no 
rivals at Salernum to successfully contest 
their fame. Thus this ancient school fell 
behind the age, and in a short time sank into 
a mediocrity which was scarcely brightened 
by the reflection of a departed glory. In 1 342 
Robert I. renewed the decree of Frederick 
II. which closed all the schools in his king- 
dom, save those of Naples, but excepted 
Salernum solely because of its antiquity and 
the traditions of his predecessors. In 1413 
King Ladislaus excepted the Salernian 
alumni and professors from all taxes, duties, 
and tribute. In the middle of the four- 
teenth century the poet Petrarch speaks of 
the school as a memory of the past; but its 
last appearance was in 1748, when a dispute 



at Paris relating to the rank of physicians 
and surgeons was referred to its university for 
arbitration and final decision. In 1 8 1 1 a formal 
decree reduced this parent of all European 
universities to a mere gymnasium or prepara- 
tory school; and now one may wander 
through the streets of the modern town and 
among the ruins of its ancient predeces- 
sor, and seek in vain to trace some reminder 
ot those who were illustrious during some of 
the most terrible ages in the world's history. 
No echo of tradition, no stone of ancient 
edifice, no library preserving precious manu- 
scripts, not even an edition of the old Saler- 
nian regimen, in the whole city; in fact, none 
now so poor as to do it reverence.

WHAT PATIENTS SHOULD BE COMMITTED 
TO THE ASYLUM, AND WHEN? 

BY E. A. CHRISTIAN, M.D. 

The points which arrest attention in con- 
sidering this question attach themselves so 
equally to each branch of the interrogatory 
that it seems wise to treat the queries as one. 
The decision as to the sanity or the insanity 
of the individual, as to the form of mental 
alienation which the disease assumes if he is 
insane, and the further question of when it is 
wisest to commit to the hospital or asylum, 
rest for decision, in many instances, upon 
considerations which cannot be eliminated 
from any one of the questions. Once grant- 
ed that the individual is insane and suffering 
from some special form of disease, then the 
propriety of his commitment may follow with 
logical and impelling conclusiveness. I bring 
to the subject also the question of diagnosis, 
because I feel the majority of physicians are 
lacking in sufficient knowledge of mental dis- 
eases to make such scientifically, especially 
in instances where doubt calls for refinement 
and accuracy of observation. — I make this 
statement in no disparagement of individuals, 
but as applicable to the profession in general, 
though perhaps less so now than formerly, 
since greater attention is given to these sub- 
jects in college curriculums. My experience 
is, the family physician is far more apt to err 
in refusing certificates of insanity where such 
would with greater propriety be granted, than 
in assisting in the commitment of individuals

not properly subjc asylum custody or 

care. 

rations which decide these i 
tions arc: Those which concern the individ- 
ual himself: those which concern his friends: 
and those which concern the public. 

It may be a- - neral proposition, 

that the chances of the patient for improve- 
ment are better with early resort to asylum 
treatment — not that asylum treatment in its 
medical features may be different or more 
skillfully applied than that afforded to the 
patient at home, but because it may be more 
systematically and surely directed, and be- 
cause of the advantages derived in psycho 
logical channels from change of associations. 
The treatment of mental disorders in their 
incipiency is an advantage not often afforded 
to asylums, and the reception of such cases 
brings to the asylum physician a feeling of 
hopefulness for the future not inspired by 
the majority of annual admissions. — I refer 
particularly to the class of cases presumably 
curable, organic changes being absent. 

I would not lay the fault of tardy commit- 
ments altogether at the doors of family physi- 
cians, for I recognize that such are often 
contending against the scruples of friends 
and the opposition of the patients; still there 
are cases where the only opposition is the 
hesitancy of the physician to certify the pa- 
tient is actually insane. The patient may 
talk freely of himself; may describe his 
symptoms clearly, and not the less accurately 
because they are, perhaps, all subjective; 
may attend to his business, perhaps, though 
always with failing or faulty powers of 
application. He is not lacking in proper 
appreciation of his relations to others, or of 
a due sense of responsibdity for his acts; 
may not objectively seem out of harmony 
with his environment, and — what is most 
troublesome to the examining physician — 
may not present any delusions. Certainly it 
would be difficult to pronounce such a man 
insane, and I am not disposed to find fault if 
he were not so pronounced provided there 
had been no previous attack of mental dis- 
turbance by which the physician might be 
guided; nevertheless, such persons may be, 
and often are, insane and imperatively in 
need of the assistance which can be afforded 
only in an insane retreat. 



A former patient recently consulted me for 
Bymptoms bu&lt; h a^, a Dumb rs before, 

had ushered in an a&lt; ute attack of i: 
cholia unaccompanied by delusions. He- 
wished to anticipate and abort the attack 
which he felt - 3 destined to come, and 

to be I as a voluntary patie: 

of the difficulty which would be encountered 

j of insanity from p 
cians and an order for commitment from the 
court. To wait for the advent of deli 
before being satisfied of the existence of 
mental disease may not only prejudice the 
patient's chances for the future, but in some 
cases injure the comfort and safety of others. 
Insanity may, and not infrequently does, 
exist without delusions, the morbid 
manifesting itself, not in disordered precep- 
tion and faulty judgments, but in disturb- 
ances of the common sensations upon which, 
we are taught, the personality of the individ- 
ual hinges, — the normal ebb and How of 
spirits having given place to an unhealthy 
depression beyond the patient's power to 
control. Patients of this class are the more 
unfortunate and especially deserving of sym- 
pathy, in that their condition is so little un- 
derstood and receives so little consideration 
from people in general. 

I would not advise the commitment of 
such where the indications are not positive; 
but oftentimes timely advice from the physi- 
cian may be of great service in strengthening 
half-formed intentions of the patient. It is 
mistaken economy to permit a man who is 
insane to remain at home so long as he may 
be able to contribute to the support of his 
family or self, since for every month that is 
thus saved to his family or to the county, 
years may accrue in which he will be a charge 
upon the public. Of the total admissions to 
the Eastern Michigan Asylum, over 62 per 
cent, were committed after the disease had 
been in existence two years and upwards; only 
about 34 per cent, where the malady had 
been less than nine months in existence. Is 
it surprising then that only about 21 per cent, 
make good recoveries? 

1 do not wish to dwell at any length upon 
the considerations which concern friends, but 
merely to emphasize what must have force- 
fully presented itself to all when confronted 
with certain forms of mental decay, viz.: 






THE MEDICAL AGE.

That grave harm may result to other people 
than the patient. The evil effects of daily 
association of a family with an insane person, 
and especially upon the younger and more 
impressionable members, are not sufficiently 
considered. The mental health of a house- 
hold as a whole receives a taint from this 
bit of unhealthy ferment, and individuals are 
warped or stunted in their mental or moral 
development. And this is not all: The con- 
tinued care of an insane person has a dele- 
terious influence upon the strength and 
health of those ministering to him, and loss 
of physical energies leading to breaking- 
down not infrequently ensues. The unselfish 
devotion in ministering to the exactions of 
an aged parent or grandparent whose mental 
faculties are lost from senile decay, may be 
morally beautiful, but likewise may lead to 
disastrous consequences in those whose ener- 
gies should be conserved for others. — I have 
known such servitude to be followed by in- 
sanity. Unfortunately the asylums are not able 
to afford relief as fast as demands are made 
upon them, but I feel that no sentiment should 
deter friends of the patient, or the attending 
physician, from exerting every effort to secure 
institutional care for this class of insane. 

Regarding considerations which concern 
the public: Americans are proverbially a 
long-suffering people as regards those evils 
which are general and affect all more or less 
alike; the common nuisance, in whatever 
form manifested, is apt to be tolerated long 
after the individual has disposed of that 
which torments him alone. The crank thrives 
in this country as he does nowhere else; and 
long after he is entirely out of harmony with 
his environment, when his ideas and conclu- 
sions are at variance with rational human 
experience and incompatible with public ex- 
pediency, he is tolerated, until the community 
is at length startled by an unusual extrava- 
gance or crime that forces measures for his 
restraint — too often only after the innocent 
have suffered. Physicians should so famil- 
iarize themselves with the literature of such 
abnormal mental manifestations as are typi- 
fied in paranoia, that they may be in position 
to recognize the Guiteaus and the Prender- 
gasts, and lend their influence to the seques- 
tration of such before the pistol is fired or 
the bomb thrown. 



I will illustrate by a case the indifference 
with which the public treats those unfortun- 
ates who, while suffering themselves, are at 
the same time a menace to others: 

The individual in question had been under 
treatment in the Asylum. At the request of his 
wife he was sent home, improved but not re- 
garded as recovered. Subsequently for two and 
a half years he was able to work when work was 
to be had. At infrequent intervals letters came 
from his wife and from the patient himself, 
asking for advice and treatment; he was still 
self-conscious of mental disorder, which he 
explained in an irrational manner, but was 
unwilling to be committed regularly, desir- 
ing to return as a voluntary patient. One 
day he appeared at the Asylum, foot-sore 
and dirty, having walked all the way from 
Detroit to interview the superintendent, who, 
he believed, could if he would rid him of his 
burden. It took careful, delicate and per- 
sistent questioning to elicit a statement of 
symptoms, and then to draw out his own ex- 
planation thereof. — It is not my purpose to 
detail these symptoms, many and interesting 
as they were. 

When asked why he had come, and what 
he expected the superintendent to do, he re- 
plied: "That is for you to decide." He did 
not want medicine now, nor institution care; 
but with earnestness, as though he must 
finally unburden himself, he went on to say 
there were various people, some his fellow- 
workmen, some in the " marine service," 
some in the "criminal service," others in the 
"postal service" ("all federal office-holders"), 
who used his brain too much; they had de- 
prived him of individuality, sending him here 
and there against his will, using his mind as 
a medium for conveying information from 
one to another. This lost individuality he de- 
sired should be restored. These people had 
been working upon his intellect too much, 
and "it must be stopped." He had been to 
the United States District Attorney to com- 
plain, and, deeming him a harmless crank, 
the people in the office had good-naturedly 
promised to consider his complaints; but the 
persecutions still went on. He did not mind 
being thus involuntarily utilized for the 
benefit of his fellow- workmen if they were 
poor and needed help, but did object to 
being made an instrument of advantage for

Time will not permit discussing more than 
a few of the points raised by the question: 
What patients to send to the asylum, and 
when? Hut I may pertinently touch upon 
some of the governing principles: 

An individual who fears the advent of 
mental disturbance is at the earliest moment 
entitled to the asylum observation and care 
for which he asks, if the physician can con- 
sistently recommend such: 

An insane person, whether suffering from 
senile insanity, from attacks of epileptic con- 
fusion, from hypochondriacal melancholia, or 
from any other form of mental perturbation, 
even such as are ordinarily regarded as 
harmless, but whose care involves wear and 
tear upon the household, and whose resi- 
dence at home is persistently detrimental to 
the development of the younger members 
thereof, should most certainly have asylum 
care: 

An individual whose continued eccentrici- 
ties, based upon mental perturbation, make 
of him a dangerous person, or in any way a 
nuisance, shouldbe restrained for the benefit 
of society: 

The presence of actual delusions is not 
necessary for the diagnosis of insanity: 

Finally, in all cases where doubt as to the 
existence of mental disorder exists in the 
mind of the family physician, I know of no 
more simple evidence than "A prolonged de- 
parture jrom the individual's normal standard 
of feeling, thinking, and acting."

SYMPATHETIC OPHTHALMIA. 

BY I,. B. MAIRE, M.I). 

Sympathetic ophthalmia is induced by pre- 
existing inflammation in the fellow eye, and 
the onset thereof may be violent and painful 



or — as . -insidious in 

Chara&lt; ming on slowly and stealthily, 

until the patient, ignorant of the danger, finds 

elf hopelessly blind; hence the import- 
ance of an early recognition of the prodro 
mal Stage of sympathetic inflammation 
not be too strongly set forth. The phyfl 
should anxiously watch the progress of an 
inflammation m an old phthisical, useless, or 
dally) recently injured eye containing a 
foreign body or a wound in the neighborhood 
of the ciliary region. It is his duty to ac- 
quaint the patient with the danger of such 
inflammations and injuries as regards the 
sound eye, so that on the occurrence of the 
slightest sympathetic irritation he may have 
the benefit of prompt treatment. 

The prodrome is generally well marked, 
consisting of intolerance or fear of light, suf- 
fusion of tears, occasional pain, weakness of 
accommodation, and more or less congestion. 
When the disease is well established, the&gt;e 
symptoms are exaggerated. 

Foreign bodies within the eye, especially 
within the iris-ciliary region; wounds of the 
eyeball, particularly in the reg'on of the cil- 
iary body; atrophy of ball resulting from 
wounds or inflammatory changes; and occa- 
sionally, as a result of inflammatory changes 
in the choroid, ossification of its structure: 
such are the common causes of sympathetic 
ophthalmia. The existence of osseous de- 
posits within the choroid will frequently 
cause sympathetic irritation and. if neglected, 
sympathetic inflammation. Incarceration of 
iris tissue in the corneal wound, by constant 
dragging also' becomes a source of danger. 
Luxation of the lens and swelling of the lens 
substance, due to traumatism, occasionally, 
by pressure on the iris and ciliary body, will 
set up a severe reaction; also intraocular 
tumors act in a similar manner. Generally 
sympathetic ophthalmia need not be appre- 
hended in phthisis corneae due to suppura- 
tion, in staphyloma, glaucoma absolutum, or 
phthisis of the eyeball following an attack of 
panophthalmitis. It is a curious fact that the 
starting-point of the disease, as well as its 
culmination, is in the offending eye, and that 
it appears first as an iridocyclitis; in other 
words, the disease commences with an irido- 
cyclitis in the first eye and ends with the 
same disease in the second. 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 



81 



The pathological changes that take place 
may be divided into those affecting the iris 
and ciliary body directly, in the form of a 
plastic inflammation, and those affecting 
these tissues as a serous exudate; and occa- 
sionally is met a third variety, first affecting 
the optic nerve, and in succession the retina, 
choroid, ciliary body, iris, and finally the 
vitreous and lens; this variety, as the result 
of personal observation, I am inclined to 
classify as a sero-plastic change. 

It will be seen that no matter where the 
first sympathetic change originates, it ulti- 
mately and invariably affects the iris-cil'ary 
region and culminates as an irido-cyclitis. 
The inflammatory changes may be rapid or 
chronic, rapidity depending more or less upon 
the character of the exudate. If the latter is 
plastic, the course will be brief, apparently 
spending its full force upon the iris and 
ciliary body — these delicate tissues, as well 
as those surrounding, will be destroyed by an 
excessive plastic exudate, and the ravages 
finally involve the tissues of the eye back of the 
iris, resulting of course in complete loss of 
vision. In cases marked by a less active re- 
action and distinguished by serous or sero- 
plastic exudate, loss of vision is not so com- 
plete though always compromised. — A patient 
suffering from this variety of sympathetic 
ophthalmia, who still possesses sufficient 
vision to be able to move about comfortably, 
should consider himself fortunate. In some 
cases the disease may manifest itself by re- 
peated attacks, each increased in severity and 
effect upon vision, until total blindness re- 
sults. 

The query is often propounded: At what 
time during an irido-cyclitis is an injured eye 
most liable to induce sympathetic disease in 
its fellow? Experience teaches such is more 
frequent when the inflammation is at its 
height, a period of about four to eight weeks; 
during subsidence there is little danger, un- 
less the atrophied and useless eye subse- 
quently becomes congested and painful — and 
this may occur at almost any time, even years 
after the original injury (it has been known 
to supervene forty years after the initial 
lesion), hence an injured eye must always re- 
main an object of more or less suspicion 
according to circumstances. An interesting 
point in this connection is that sometimes, 



after the sympathetic process has done its 
work, the eye originally affected turns out to 
be the more serviceable of the two. 

The most perplexing feature of sympa- 
thetic ophthalmia is the precise means where- 
by the disease is transmitted — an enigma that 
has never been definitely answered. Years 
since Mackenzie called attention to the fact 
that a good eye may become inflamed sec- 
ondarily through some influence exerted by 
its fellow, and he supposed the infection was 
by way of the optic nerve. Another and 
somewhat plausible theory is that transmis- 
sion is by means of the ciliary nerves, which 
supply the uveal tract or the vascular pig- 
mented portion of the eyeball, consisting of 
the iris, ciliary body, and choroid; but it is 
difficult to explain how the ciliary nerves of 
one side can communicate with those of the 
other, since they have no immediate connec- 
tion; in such case the route would be by way 
of the nerve centre and return along the fel- 
low ciliary nerve to the eyeball. The short 
ciliary nerves contain motor, sensitive, and 
sympathetic nerve fibres derived from the 
ophthalmic ganglion. Just what influence 
the sympathetic system and the lymphatics 
may exert has not been determined, but be- 
yond question they hold an important re- 
lation. Some attention has been also given 
the question whether transmission may not 
be by way of the circulation and the circle 
of Willis, but this would apparently be al- 
together too roundabout and far-fetched, as 
it involves the choroidal vessels, ophthalmic 
artery and internal carotid of one side, and, 
on passing the circle of Willis, a return in 
reverse order to the other eye. 

It must be admitted the optic nerve offers 
the most plausible solution of the problem, 
and recent investigations lend additional 
strength to this view. Deutschman has dem- 
onstrated that cultivations of staphylococci 
instilled into the eyeball or along the sheath 
of the optic nerve do travel from the point of 
injection along the nerve itself to the brain, 
and from thence return along the opposite 
nerve to its eye. Further, in confirmation of 
the theory, I may be permitted to briefly cite 
a recent case that came under observation: 

B. S , aged 16, was kicked by a horse 

in the right eye, in the latter part of April, 1 894,

Examination of the enucleated eye revealed 
the optic nerve infiltrated and of dark color, 
which, taken in conjunction with the appear- 
ance of neuro-retinitis, would appear to go 
toward evidencing the sympathetic ophthal- 



mia was in this instance the sequel of infec- 
tion by way of the optic commifi 

fellow optic nerve. 

The treatment chiefly followed embraced 
liberal use of atropme sulphate instillat 
and internally potassium iodide and mer- 
cury bichloride. Often nothing is demanded 
in )re than relief from the offending of the 
injured eye, which should of cour&gt;e take 
place during the prodromal stage. And 
if the defective optic is highly painful and 
harbors a foreign body, with loss of vision, 
it is wiser to enucleate than to run chances, 
since once a sympathetic ophthalmia is estab- 
lished, but little benefit can be had from the 
operation. But if the exciting eye retain 
power of vision, even in slight degree, enucle- 
ation is not warranted, since it may ultimately 
prove the better eye for vision; at all events, 
it is better to await the subsidence of inflam- 
mation. The question whether it is best to 
immediately enucleate an eye injured in the 
region of the ciliary body is still mooted, 
though personal experience suggests an eye 
wounded in the region of the iris and ciliary 
body is* dangerous to carry around; and if 
the ciliary body is penetrated, and there is 
loss of vision, I believe no chances should be 
taken, but prompt enucleation effected. If 
the wound of the ciliary body is extensive, it 
should be enucleated without regard to 
vision, as in all probability the latter will be 
destroyed during the progress of the super- 
vening inflammation.

CESAREAN OPERATION AFTER VERSION

Ugeskrift for Lceger (Copenhagen) narrates 
a case of labor, primipara, forty years old, in 
which the head presented, was movable and 
high up; the umbilical cord and one forearm 
had prolapsed. The pelvis was contracted. 
Version and extraction were performed under 
chloroform, and the body of the infant disen- 
gaged, but not the head. As the neck was 
torn, it was found necessary to complete the 
separation, and to perform Cesarean section 
for extraction of the head, which was tightly 
impacted in the superior strait. The woman 
recovered, but only after a protracted attack 
of peritonitis.

Editorial 



PARTURIUNT MONTES, NASCETUR RIDIC= 

ulus nus. 

A most interesting little pamphlet, yclept 
medical journal, emanates from Richmond, 
Virginia, under the editorial auspices of an 
"all-round good fellow," Doctor Bryce — we 
say "good fellow," since all who know him 
concede his right to the title in its most 
liberal acceptation. It is a matter of regret 
to his friends, however, that he ever entered 
upon the " troubled waters of journalism," 
since his own honesty of purpose leads him 
to readily assume like rectitude on the part 
of all with whom he comes in contact, and 
oftentimes renders him the too easy prey 
of the Philistines; thus he is sometimes 
induced to stab in the back with his editorial 
stylus those with whom he has no quarrel and 
who are very far from wishing him harm. 

In a recent issue of the Southern Clinic 
which reached our table bearing in bold two- 
inch black letters the legend "Marked Copy," 
we find reproduced under the caption "Look 
on This Picture," an editorial that appeared 
in The Medical Age some three months 
back, followed by a clipping from the Detroit 
Free Press duly re-baptized "And Now Look 
on This!" 

The former was a production intended to 
discourage, on the part of our fellow-practi- 
tioners, too great haste in accepting new 
remedial agents — and Antitoxin in particu- 
lar — as specifics against all the ills to which 
humanity is heir; the article from the Free 
Press covers reference to local enterprise in 
the manufacture of Antitoxin. 



The natural assumption is, an endeavor on 
the part of Brother Bryce to show there is 
"a cog loose" somewhere in the connection 
between the firm that is preparing to manu- 
facture Antitoxin, and the editor of this jour- 
nal, as he carefully notes The Medical Age 
"is published by Mr. Geo. S. Davis," who is 
also interested with the aforesaid manufac- 
turing house. Though not expressed in so 
many words, it is intended to query why The 
Medical Age apparently opposes the trade 
interests of its publisher. 

Perusal of the two lucubrations so care- 
fully copied by Brother Bryce would seem to 
convey sufficient reply, and evidence that the 
editorial policy of The Medical Age is en- 
tirely separate and distinct fro ca. the mercantile 
policy of its publisher — a fact that has been 
made sufficiently patent on many occasions 
during the past eighteen months. And it 
may now be understood, once for all, that 
The Medical Age, as a purveyor of medical 
literature, is beholden only to its editor. 

Incidentally we were somewhat curious to 
know how our Richmond friend became pos- 
sessed of the information that to him appears 
so astounding and incongruous, since The 
Medical Age does not exchange with his 
periodical, and it is hardly within the bounds 
of probability that he subscribes for the daily 
Free Press. But on another page was found 
the following scientific paragraph: 

"Daily Reminder." This is the name of a 
pretty and valuable little diary sent us from 

Messrs. F k S -s &amp; Co., of Detroit. We thank 

you very much, gentlemen, and trust it may re- 
mind us to prescribe your excellent remedies all 
through the year 1895. 

Pursuing the investigation, it was found 
Doctor Bryce advertises the above firm, which 
has obtained no little notoriety of somewhat 
questionable character through its exploiting 
of "non- secrets" and direct and indirect ad- 
vertising of its wares to the laity. We also 
note that the house with which the publisher 
of THe Medical Age is connected does not 
patronize the Southern Clinic, which would 
appear to afford pretty conclusive evidence 
of the advertising value of the latter. And 
herein, too, is apparent the woolly pate of an 
aboriginal denizen of the " Dark Continent" 
but half-concealed in the foliage of the pecu- 
liar growth that gives birth to Cod-liver Oil

kind; and we would prefer to see the Southern 
Clinic representing only the type of gentle- 
man of which its editor has hitherto been 
such a distinguished example. Evidently, 
too. Doctor Bryce had some doubts in this 
matter, since he took special pains to favor 
us with his journal— a procedure quite con- 
trary to the policy of those who supplied h&gt;m 
with the material for the "sensation" men- 
tioned above, and who make it a rule, in so 
far as possible, to conceal attacks of this kind 
by publishing in periodicals of limited circula- 
tion and supposed not to come under our eye. 
For no one is better aware of the fact than 
these instigators that The Medical Age, in 
so far as literary text may be concerned, is 
controlled exclusively by its editor.

THE SPHINCTER OF THE BLADDER. 

Doctor Joseph Griffith, in the Journal of 
Anatomy and Physiology, who has been giving 
very close study to the physiology of the 
bladder and urethra, says that the supposed 
sphincter muscle of the bladder is a myth. 
All writers agree that the chief resistance to 
the outflow of urine from the bladder under 
natural conditions is at the urethro-vesical 
orifice, but some, such as Budge, Heiden- 
hain, Colberg, Sauer, and Uffelmann, attrib- 
ute the resistance to the action of a special 
muscle, "internal sphincter vesicae," sur- 
rounding the neck of the bladder, while 
others, again, uphold the influence of the 
"external sphincter vesicae " of Henle. But 
there does not exist either in animals or in 
man a special muscular thickening or sphinc- 
ter; the office is sufficiently performed by 
the ordinary muscular wall of the urethra 
and urethro-vesical orifice. Further, the ex- 
ternal sphincter vesicae of Henle does not 
commence at the urethro-vesical orifice even 
in man, and in some of the lower animals, 
such as the cat, it is at a distance of one and 
one-half inches from this point. 



It is in by k.'hiraiiM h that the 

J of the detrusor uriiia*, or tlx 

longitudinal muscular fibres of the bladder, 
are inserted at right angles into the mythical 

internal sphincter and he BUp 

the oeck of the bladder is opened by these 
longitudinal fibres pulling upon the \\h 
the sphincter, whereby the sides of the 
urethro-vesical orifice are separated. The 
majority of the external longitudinal mus- 
cular fibres of the bladder, however, if care- 
fully traced, will be found to gradually change 
their direction, becoming oblique and trans- 
verse before they reach the neck, conse- 
quently are not inserted into the exterior of 
the urethro-vesical orifice and cannot exer- 
cise any influence upon the walls thereof. 

The natural or normal retention of urine 
depends upon the state of the muscle in the 
wall of the bladder during the accumulation, 
and upon the resistance offered by the ure- 
thra to the outflow. Doctor Griffith does not 
wish it to be inferred that there exist no 
"special muscular mechanisms for the con- 
trol of the escape of urine," but desires to 
emphasize the fact that these muscular mech- 
anisms are not ordinarily exercised in the 
normal retention of urine, and indeed are 
not essential to it; as already remarked, the 
essential factor in retention is that the pres- 
sure of the urine in the bladder when retained 
in small or large quantities exceeds but little 
the mere hydrostatic pressure. The amount 
of piessure in excess of the hydrostatic in 
any given case is exerted upon the muscular 
walls, and whether the viscus be nearly empty 
or pretty fully distended, this portion of the 
total pressure usually remains small and 
much the same. Therefore the bladder walls 
are ever undergoing not only dilatation, but 
also actual relaxation, and during the ac- 
cumulation of urine the muscular fibres ac- 
commodate themselves to the increased 
quantity of fluid This power has its limit, 
but that limit is not reached under normal 
conditions. 

Thus the urine is naturally retained by 
virtue of the physical resistance to the open- 
ing of the urethro-vesical orifice, and by the 
muscular wall of the bladder relaxing and ac- 
commodating itself to the increased quantity 
of urine without causing an increase in the 
intra- vesical pressure beyond the hydrostatic.

NUCLEIN-CAUTLON. 

Now that this new remedy seems to have 
established itself as a therapeutic agent of no 
little merit, it becomes necessary to call the 
attention of the profession to the fact there 
are a number of products marketed under this 
title that do not at all coincide with the de- 
mands for a Nuclein. 

It must be remembered that Nuclein re- 
quires to be constantly and persistently 
employed in doses of fifty to a hundred 
minims daily of a one percent, solution; and 
that this must be continued for weeks, months, 
and perhaps even years. 

Again, there are purported solutions of 
Nuclein which upon chemical test afford a 
neutral or alkaline reaction, and likewise are 
strongly alcoholic. True Nuclein, however, 
is an acid solution, and when brought into the 
presence of alcohol is instantaneously de- 
stroyed. 

Nuclein can in no way be compared with 
such substances as morphine or atropine 
when employed hypodermatically. Tablets 
of these alkaloids for subdermic use are es- 
sential products, but they are rarely used 
more than once or twice for any case, or at 
most not employed continuously for more 
than a few days; are dissolved in small 
quantities of water, and injected in strong 
solution for immediate effect; yet with all due 
precaution these alkaloids sometimes induce 
abscesses, even when the syringe employed 
is given a great deal of care. 

Nuclein, as already remarked, must be 
employed constantly and persistently in large 
doses for long periods, and this too in cases 
where the inherent resistance to infective 
toxins is at a minimum. It is evident, there- 
fore, that this therapeutic agent cannot be 
employed in the form of a hypodermatic 
tablet without becoming dangerous to the 
patient and inimical to the standing of the 
drug itself. 

To employ Nuclein, then, it is demanded 
that the solution be examined and tested, 
first, for its chemical reaction, and, second, 
for the presence of an alcoholic constituent; 
next, that it be employed by means of a 
hypodermatic syringe especially reserved for 
such purpose, and that is constantly sub- 
jected to most rigid antisepsis. 



ANTITOXIN VS. ANTITOXINE — WARNING. 

It may not be generally known to the medi- 
cal profession that there are two medicaments 
in market bearing this title. The Antitoxin 
Serum is the remely which is heralded for 
the treatment of diphtheria. The other " An- 
titoxine " is claimed as " a fine white powder 
quite soluble in water, more so on the addi- 
tion of a little glycerin," put up in ounce 
boxes; moreover is a proprietary remedy 
manufactured in Great Britain, which, like 
most of its ilk, claims wonderful antipyretic 
and analgesic properties. 

Thus it behooves physicians who desire to 
investigate the serum treatment of diphtheria 
to be assured of the material ordered. It is 
not unlikely that even the druggists and 
general purveyors of therapeutic remedies 
may be misled, and that the individual order- 
ing Antitoxin may at times receive instead 
" Antitoxine." 



EDITORIAL NOTES. 



The Dominion Medical Honthly.— 

The secession from the ranks of a number 
of collaborators seems to have given rise to a 
belief that the Dominion Medical Monthly has 
suspended or is about to do so. 

We are very glad to be able to state of our 
own personal knowledge that the Dominion 
Medical Monthly will continue to flourish 
under the able editorial and publishing man- 
agement of our friend Doctor Beattie Nesbitt. 
Number i of Volume IV, January, 1895, is 
on our table, and we observe the periodical 
has lost none of its old-time merit, but is, on 
the contrary, materially improved. We are 
glad to know too that Doctor Nesbitt will 
henceforth devote more personal attention 
thereto, which certainly will greatly enhance 
the value of this esteemed exchange. 

Defense of the Dude.— 

The National Medical Review defends the 
dude on the ground of his cleanliness — " not 
one little part of him, simply, but as a whole 
individual." It calls attention to the fact 
that " his collar is never melted with the heat 
of summer, nor his shoes covered with the 
sands of time; his linen is not stained with 
the drippings of a tobacco press, neither are 






red with the Of an- 

tiquity; h ifl not the sign of a pool 

barber, neither are his fingers plowed with 
the deep fissures of the bichloride." Finally, 
the Review insists that the dude is "surgically 
clean, the latest teacher, and that the world 
in general can profit by his leSSOIlfl 

A Lost Art.— 

A few years since physicians knew enough 
of drugs and pharmacy to prescribe medi- 
cines from a pocket-case and secure practi- 
cally accurate division by the unaided eye. 
But the development of tablet triturates has 
done away with this, and the modern gradu- 
ate if deprived of these would find himself 
entirely at sea. Under these circumstances 
the tablet triturate has worked more harm 
than good. Besides, the triturate as generally 
manufactured carries no evidence of accur- 
acy when it embodies a fluid preparation. 

Urocidin.— 

Under this title appears another of the 
myriad proprietary preparations which are 
so rapidly multiplying, the promoters of 
which claim it as a "sure remedy" for uric- 
acid diathesis. It is said to be merely a 
mechanical mixture of citrates of potassium, 
sodium, and lithium, with Glauber's salt 
added. 

The Popular Science Monthly and Antitoxin 
Serum.— 

The February number of the Popular 
Science Monthly presents a very complete 
article on "The Serum Treatment of Diph- 
theria," by Doctor Samuel T. Armstrong, 
Visiting Physician to the Hospital for Con- 
tagious Diseases, New York. 

Death of Doctor Loomis.— 

The medical profession generally will be 
grieved to learn of the death of Professor 
Alfred L. Loomis, of New York, which oc- 
curred on Wednesday, the 23d ult., from 
pneumonia. He had been ill only from the 
previous Saturday. 

Personal.— 

Doctor George H. Goodger, of the class of 
1890, Detroit College of Medicine, is located 
at Davisburgh, Michigan, and would like the 
different members of his class to communi- 
cate with him.

Losing Hold on Life.— 

I old countries the lower orders, as a rul&lt; 
have bin a low vitality. It may be truer to 
say that the vital volition is weak. let the 
learned settle the definition. The fad is 
easily accounted for. During generations 
upon generations the majority ol Kuropean 
agricultural populations live upon vegetable 
food, like the majority of Eastern Asiatics, 
and with the same result. Hard labor pro- 
duces hard muscles, but vegetable food \ 
a low vital tension, so to say. Soldiers know 
it well enough. The pale-face.d city clerk 
who eats meat twice a day will outfight and 
outlast and outstarve the burly laborer whose 
big thews and sinews are mostly compounded 
of potatoes, corn, and water. — "Casa Brad 
cio," by Marion Crawford in the February 
Century. 

Death of the Oldest Negro Woman in Amer- 
ica.— 

Millie Jefferson, believed to have been the 
oldest negro woman in America, died at the 
residence of her great-grandson in New York 
on December 17th. The date of her birth, 
March 30th, 1785, is definitely known; so 
that at the time of her death she was one 
hundred and nine yeais, eight months and 
sixteen days old. She was born on the plan- 
tation of Thomas Jefferson in Virginia, and 
married the body-servant of thatdistinguished 
statesman. Three of her nine children sur- 
vive her, and there are fifty-seven grandchil- 
dren and twenty-six great grandchildren liv- 
ing. After the Civil War she moved from 
Virginia to Louisiana, and had resided in 
New York only for the last eight years. — 
Boston Medical and Surgical Journal. 

Locked Nymphce. — 

A recent issue of the Medical Times con- 
tains what under other circumstances we 
should be tempted to call a "cock-and-bull 
story," about a lady who consulted Doctor 
Collyer, of New York, for "locked nymphae," 
the nymphae aforesaid being padlocked by a 
jealous husband during his occasional ab- 
sences. The most remarkable part of the 
story is that the poor, suffering wife is al- 
leged to hare submitted to this treatment for 
upwards of five years before consulting any- 
one. 1 his brutal method of enforcing physical 
chastity goes far beyond the plan adopted by 
the suspicious French king whose "girdle of 
chastity " is one of the curiosities that tempt 
English travelers to the Musee de Cluny, in 
Pans. — Medical Press and Circular.

Warning.— 

An editorial in the Journal of the A?nerican 
Medical Association refers to the total failure 
of erysipelas toxin injections for the cure of 
sarcomata and other malignant growths, and 
the 'fact that though the remedy has been 
faithfully tried, not a single well authenti- 
cated case of recovery has been report&lt; d. 

This leads to the rema k that the New 
York City health department warns physi- 
cians to have care during the present craze 
that fraud be not practiced on them by prepa- 
rations of the different toxins, especially the 
diphtheria serum as placed on the market by 
mercantile houses. Such fraudulent prepa- 
rations, it declares, are nowjn the market. — 
Omaha Clinic. 

Why? 

Doctor J. P. Dake, a leading Tennessee 
homceopathist, claims [Medical Current) that 
the law of similars is not applicable to 
any diseases which are characterized by de- 
struction of tissues, or when the cause cannot 
be removed, or to such as are due to chemi- 
j cal action, mechanic^ violence, or unhygienic 
I surroundings. This would reduce homoeop- 
athy to the treatment of functional disorders 
, exclusively. Under the circumstances it is 
I difficult to see why Doctor Dake should re- 
I tain a sectarian title, unless it be for advertis- 
1 ing purposes. — Medical Standard. 

Literary Note. — 

The Medical and Surgical Reporter, speak - 

I ing of medical literature, says: 

" ' Of the making of books there is no end,' 
thanks to the prevision of generous publish- 
ers, and the literary crop of the year contains 
some wheat among the tares. A few works 
have been issued in special lines whose value 
ju-tifies their existence. For pronounced ex- 
cellence, general utility, and widest applica- 

j tion, Doctor Gould's new medical dictionary 
deserves specific mention among the publi- 
cations of 1894." 

Support for the Index Medicus.— 

The Boston Society for Medical Improve- 
ment, at its annual meeting on January 7th, 
appropriated a sum from its reserve funds 
- for the support of the Index Medicus, on con- 
dition that similar steps should be takea by 
other societies and institutions in Boston and 
other cities, which are or ought to be inter- 
ested in securing the continued publication 
of this valuable periodical. — Bostu?i Medical 
and Surgical Journal. 



Book Reviews, 



The Cosmopolitan. Price, 15 cents; $r 50 a year. 
Cosmopolitan Publishing Co., Irvington on- 
the-Hudson, N. Y. 

In the January number begins an old- 
fashioned sea story, full of interest and 
adventure, by W. Clark Russell. Ouida con- 
tributes an installment of the " Great Passions 
of History" series, which has been appearing 
in this magazine. A discussion is aroused by 
Mr. Edward Bok's article on "The Young 
Man and the Church." Just preceding the 
famous Charcot's death he prepared an arti- 
cle for The Cosmopolitan on Pasteur, to be 
published after Pasteur's death, but Charcot 
has died first, and so with the consent of his 
executors the a tide is given now. 1 he 
present " I heatrical Season in New York" is 
critically considered by Mr. James S. Met- 
calfe, and there are stories by Tourgee, 
Howells, and the famous French writer 
Francois Coppee. 

In the February number General Lord 
Wolseley makes a most important contribu- 
tion to the literature of the China Japan war 
in an article entitled "What China Should 
Do." Two other noted foreign authors con- 
tribute interesting articles to this number — 
Rosita Mauri, the famous Parisian danseuse, 
gives the history of the ballet, and Emile 
Ollivier tells the story o; "The Fall of Louis 
Philippe." Juban Hawthorne writes of " Sal- 
vation via the Rack," which is illustrated with 
drawings and puotographs of the var ous in- 
struments used to torture poor humanity. 
Mrs. Reginald de Koven, Anatole France, 
W. Clark Russell, Albion W. Tourgee and 
William Dean Howells also contribute to this 
number. 



Review of Reviews. Price, 25 cents; $2.50 per 
year. The Review of Reviews Co., New York. 

The January issue is especially interesting. 
The frontispiece is a portrait of Robert Louis 
Stevenson, and there is embodied in the text 
a sketch of this not^d author, and likewise 
another picture, drawn from life by Victor 
Gribayedoff. Mr. Robert Donald presents a 
pen picture of John Burns, and an account 
of the public and private life of the latter 
that is calculated to cause Americans to view 
this gentleman in a new light. 

In the department of " Progress of the 
World " attention is called to the decline of 
smallpox and typhoid fever, and the increased 
efforts of modern sanitary science to grapple 
with children's diseases, especially diphtheria 
and scarlet fever. In the same department 
is discussed the Nicaragua Canal question,

it is never laid down until it has been read 
from title-page to finis.

Lourdes. By Emile Zola. Cloth; i6mc; pp. 486. 
Price, $1.25. . Chicago: F. Tennyson Neeley. 

This is one of the few books of Zola's 
which we can unhesitatingly recommend; 
moreover, it is the best and most powerful, 
and will excite curiosity and interest in that 
it aims to tell as exactly as possible what 
may be seen by a person who accompanies 
the pilgrimage to Lourdes without any belief 
regarding its miracles, either for or against. 
It is an impartial study of what goes on at 
the, great Continental shrine of the Virgin 
— an excellent study of the faith cure, and 
moreover a truthful picture of the evils that 
surround such minglings of religion and 
mammon. 

It is stated that this work has been put on 
the Index Expurgatorius of the Roman 
Catholic Church. If this be true, no graver 
error could have been committed, since no 
church or class of religionists can afford to 
bolster up what \sper se a manifest fraud and 
means of illicit money-getting.

a better criticism than to oiler the motto

&gt;m but a unitary conception of the 
world, no dogma but religion, no creed but

This is the second revised and enlarged

peared as a series of editorials in The Open

discussed in that journal, the results accru-

OPHTHALMIC Diseases and Therapeutics. By A. 
B. Norton, M.D. Half morocco; Svo; pp. 555. 
Price, $4.50. Boericke cS: Tafel, Philadelphia. 

This is nominally a homoeopathic book, 
being the work of a homoeopathic practi- 
tioner. Nevertheless it is a volume the equal 
of any that has proceeded from any source 
upon this topic. It is a complete exponent 
of ophthalmic diseases, and abounds in new 
and clever ideas which must necessarily be of 
great advantage to the student. It is, more- 
over, elegantly illustrated, there being no 
less than fifty three plates exclusive of a 
dozen lithographic figures. We cordially 
recommend the volume as a most valuable 
text-book to the medical profession at large 
without reference to "pathy" or u ism." 



Practical Urine-Analysis and Urinary Diag- 
nosis. By Charles W. Purdy. M.D. Cloth; 8vo; 
pp. 360 Price, $2.50. The F. A. Davis Co., 
Philadelphia. 

The fact that this work is by the author of 
"Bright's Disease and Allied Affections of 
the Kidneys," and also of " Diabetes, its 
Symptoms and Treatment," is sufficient evi- 
dence of its value. It is fully up to date, 
and deals with urine-analysis in all its phases, 
simple and compound, hence is available for 
the chemist as well as the physician. In 
matters of diagnosis it is especially full, and 
since the publication of Bird's work there 
has been none in the English language that 
so completely fulfills the wants of the practi- 
tioner. 



In Sunny France. By Henry Tuckley. Cloth;

This is a most readable book, being both 
easy and interesting, portraying present-day 



in the French Republic. It pr- 
a picture of Gallic lite, manners, CUStomd 
laws, and religion. If one has never had a 
desire to visit the Republic, such will be 
speedily stimulated by reading this delight- 
ful little work. Lt is almost a complete guidl 
book to Paris, and the contrast which is diawn 
between this city of beauty and gaiety, and 
London, which is all stability ami commerce, 
only adds to the interest every American 
must have in both cities. We cordially re 
mend the work to all.

Costa, M.D. Cloth; i2mo; pp. 809. Price, 
W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia. 

The aim of this volume is to present in 
clear and concise form the fundamental prin- 
ciples, chief operations, and exact methods of 
modern surgery — in fact, its scope is to stand 
between the cumbrous text book and the 
concentrated compend; which necessitated 
the elimination of obsolete and unessential 
methods in favor of the living and essential 
A large amount of space is devoted to frac-

is well taken up, the most important proced-

That this attempt to reduce the practice 
of medicine within concise and assimilable 
limits has not failed, is evidenced by the fact 
that a third edition was called for within two 
years of its appearance. 



Twentieth Century Practice — An International 
Encyclopaedia of Modern Surgical Science. 

Messrs. William Wood &amp; Co. announce under 
this title a new work by leading authorities of 
Europe and America, to be complete in twenty oc- 
tavo volumes. 

They say: " Considering the vast progress 
which medical science has made during the past 
twenty years, and the complete revolution which 
theory and practice have in many cases undergone, 
the time has seemed ripe for a full presentation by 
master hands of medicine as it is at the close of the 
nineteenth and opening of the twentieth century. 
To this end a large number of writers, nun of 
acknowledged international reputation and undis- 
puted authority, have been invited to undertao 
the work; each one is a master, and conceded to be 
such by the entire medical world In fine, no pains 
will be spared to make the work what its name indi- 
cates — an authoritative guide to the practice of 
medicine at the opening of the twentieth century. 

This work will be under the immediate super- 
vision of Doctor Thomas L. Siedman, of New York 
City, and the first volume may be expected some 
time in February. A complete prospectus will be 
sent upon application to the publishers.

Therapeutic Brevities. 



Cocaine Hypodermatically . — In the Virginia 
Medical Monthly, Doctor W. P. Carr gives a 
table of 283 cases showing the varied uses to 
which Cocaine can be put. About the mouth 
it is usually unsatisfactory, and disagreeable 
symptoms are often produced; the effect is 
also confined to a small area, is incomplete 
and transient. The only dangerous symp- 
toms ever noticed arose from the use of 
cocaine in the mouth, and this was a case of 
extreme susceptibility. Hypodermatic in- 
jections can be used in inflamed and highly 
sensitive tissues without the slightest pain, 
but it is never necessary to insert the needle 
at an excessively tender spot. He injected 
one grain in about the middle of the extensor 
surface of his own forearm, and found, in 
eight minutes, loss of sensation following the 
cutaneous branches of the radial nerve down 
to the middle finger, forming a strip of coca- 
inized skin eight or ten inches long and not 
over an inch in width. He prefers four- or 
eight-per-cent. solution. 



Antitoxin and Nephritis. — I regret to have 
to record that a further experience of anti- 
toxin has resulted in six deaths out of a total of 
eight cases treated, all due to inflammation of 
the kidneys. This is a sad but singular con- 
firmation of the testimony published in the 
Medical Press from Doctor Benda, of Berlin, 
who, on post-mortem examination of thirty- 
nine subjects dying under the antitoxin treat- 
ment, found nephritis in thirty- three cases, 
eight of which were of severe grade. 

From an analysis of 1,000 consecutive 
cases of diphtheria, I find that death under 
the usual treatment resulted from uraemia in 
only 2.7 per cent., the total mortality being 
at the rate of 27.4 per cent. It is perfectly 
clear that if we are to get at the truth of the 
result of antitoxin treatment, an autopsy 
should be made on every case dying under 
it, that we may learn the exact cause of 
death in each case of fatal issue. — Doctor 
Lennox Browne, in Medical Press and Cir- 
cular. 



Croton Chloral an Antidote for Strychnine. — 
In the course of some experiments to deter- 
nine the action of toxic substances upon the 
excitability of peripheral nerves and muscles, 
&gt;igorescu developed the fact that Butyl- 
chloral opposes the toxic action of strychnine. 
[rle found that if injections of strychnine 
»vere made in frogs, those which also received 
|3utyl-Chloral remained torpid, while those 



with strychnine alone were tetanized. The 
least noise increased the tetanus of the latter, 
but the former did not show any spasm. 
After some hours the Butyl-Chloral was elim- 
inated, then these frogs were seized with 
tetanus as were the others. On repeating 
the antidote up to the elimination of. the 
strychnine, complete cures resulted. On ex- 
perimenting with larger frogs similar results 
were obtained. The observations demon- 
strate that Butyl-Chloral energetically opposes 
its physiological action to the physiological 
action of strychnine. — Archives de Physiologic 



Nitro- Glycerin in Vomiting. — I have used 
Nitro- glycerin systematically for the last three 
years in every form of vomiting. In vomit- 
ing of gastric catarrh, whether adult or in- 
fantile, acute or chronic, alcoholic or anaemic, 
it acts almost as a specific — the vomiting 
ceases at once. In vomiting of advanced 
pregnancy it is of the greatest service; and 
in many cerebral cases it also markedly 
checks the sickness. In peritonitis alone it 
increases the vomiting, not, however, to a 
distressing extent, and the effect soon passes 
off. In vomiting in connection with pul- 
monary phthisis it is of little value; atropine 
is better. In combination with catechu it 
acts very well in lienteric diarrhoea. The 
vomiting of influenza is often relieved by it, 
though not to the same extent as by atropine.

Journal. 



Ipecac as an Oxytocic. — A contributor to the 
British Medical Journal says: In the course 
of general practice extending over many 
years I invariably carried a bottle of Wine 
of Ipecac in my midwifery bag, and rarely 
if ever gave a dose of ergot in the first stage 
of labor. Time after time on coming to a 
confinement case where the pains had been 
feeble and inefficient, or had totally ceased, 
two or three ten- or fifteen-minim doses of 
the wine at intervals of fen minutes have been 
followed in a surprisingly short time by en- 
ergetic uterine action, with a rapid termina- 
tion of the labor. It never produces the 
quasi-tetanic contraction so often met with 
as the result of ergot, the pains continuing 
to recur regularly, just as they do in natural 
labor, but with greater force* and at shorter 
intervals.

meat Consequently he enters ■ 

ISt the torture which only patient 
and confiding woman can endure. He fur- 
ther addfl that by the use of such m&lt; 
ments as Liquor Sedans and Saw Palmetto, 
Surgery could be done away with, and these 
- "arc destined to produce a new era in 
JOlogy;" that in "irregular, painful, 
Suppressed and excessive menstruation Liq- 
uor Sedans is almost a specific," while in 
uterine or ovarian neuralgias or displace- 
ments " it acts like magic." 



Diphtheria, — A doctor of good standing 
affirms that he obtained in the treatment of 
diphtheria as favorable results from the ad- 
ministration of a combination of Iodide of 
Sodium and Salicylate of Soda as those re- 
ported from the use of the serum therapy, 
without its risks. His mixture is: 

Iodide of sodium, 30 grains. 
Salicylate of soda, 1 drachm. 
Syrup of orange, 1 ounce. 
Water, sufficient to make 8 ounces. 
Dose: A tablespoonful every hour for a child. 

Out of seventeen cases thus treated, only 
three ended fatally. Under the influence of 
the mixture the false membranes become 
rapidly detached, and their reproduction 
ceases in a short time completely. — Medical 
Press and Circular. 



Lactophenin and Acute Articular Rheuma- 
tism. — Doctor von Roth, in the Wiener Klin- 
ische Wochcnschrift, declares that in acute 
articular rheumatism Lactophenin is far su- 
perior to sodium salicylate, and moreover 
induces no unpleasant effects. Twenty-eight 
cases were treated with this preparation, and 
in all, pain, local redness and swelling disap- 
peared after twenty four to forty eight hours, 
thus ushering in convalescence; the tempera- 
ture was permanently depressed. Doctor 
von Roth also adds " the remedy rendered 
excellent service in individual cases of chorea, 
and mitigated the severest neuralgias of the 
tabetic." 



Alstonia Cons trie la — Given as a tonic in 
cases of debility dependent upon defective 
assimilation due to faulty digestion; also in 
debility following uterine disorders. Cath- 
cart, of Australia, used it with success in the 
debility following parturition, or arising from 
lactation, or prostration from fevers. In 
atonic dyspepsia with loss of appetite, and in 
the diarrhoea following indigestion, it pro- 



duces good results. In DerVOUS prostration 
following uterine displacements, that are 

without anaemia with the consequent 1 

live faults, Alstonia is most valuable.— . Mcd-

Epileptic Insanity. — Bondurant, in the Amer- 
ican Journal of Insanity, declares borax, anti- 
pyrm, acetanilid, phenacetin, and many other 
alleged anti-epileptic agents, save m rare 
. are without influence: that while the 
bromides may postpone the occurren&lt; I 
the Convulsions, in mOSl cases they "do more 
harm than good." In dealing with the ma- 
niacal attacks, seclusion may be necessary. 
Sedatives should be employed very rarely, if 
at all. The best single remedy in the status 
epileptic us is Blo^d letting, and of drugs the 
most valuable is Chloral. 



Parsons' Local Anaesthetic. — 

Chloroform, 12 grammes. 
Tincture of aconite, 12 grammes. 
Tincture of capsicum, 4 grammes. 
Tincture of pyrethrum, 2 grammes. 
Oil of cloves, 2 grammes. 
Gum camphor, 2 grammes. 

Dissolve camphor in chloroform, add oil of cloves, 
and lastly the tinctures. 

This is accredited with almost magical 
local anaesthetic effects. 



Tapeworm. — The Medical Brief recom- 
mends the flowers of Mignonette. Two 
ounces of the flowers are steeped in a pint of 
boiling wa'er for an hour, or until their 
strength is exhausted. The decoction is then 
strained and the whole taken at one dose, 
fasting — that is, nothing must be eaten for 
twenty-four hours previous to taking. In 
half an hour two ounces of Castor Oil must 
be ingested, and in a short time the parasite 
is expelled whole. 



Cannabis Indica for Itching. — Mackenzie 
declares Indian Hemp will give relief in the 
itching of skin diseases not amenable to local 
treatment. The full effect of the drug must 
be produced promptly. He employs the 
tincture in doses of five or ten drops 00 
sugar, repeated as often as is necessary. 



Sparteine Externally. — Doctors Guinard 
and Gustave Geley report to the French 
Academy of Sciences that they have found 
the external application of Sparteine to give 
remarkable results in cases where the skin is 
the active seat of disease, more particularly 
in cases of erysipelas.

Cod Liver Oil — What is It?* — Ever 
since 1841, when cod-liver oil was so strongly 
advocated by Bennett, it has held a promi- 
nent place in the confidence of physicians. 
From this date we find that many and care- 
ful studies have been made, so that we may 
say that its scientific use is of comparatively 
recent origin, although it has been employed 
empirically for nearly two hundred years. 
The chemistry of this subject is by no means, 
even now, complete, although many analyses 
have been made, so that at intervals one 
finds in the literature various hypotheses as 
to what ingredients this remedy's virtues may 
be attributed to. In spite of discordant theo- 
ries and the contradictory results of chemi- 
cal analysis, cod- liver oil is still regarded as 
a remedy of the highest value in diseases 
marked by malnutrition, of which pulmonary 
tuberculosis is the most frequent occasion 
for its employment. 

What then can be said of its composition? 
Briefly, it is principally, first, olein glyceride 
(70 per cent.) with variable quantities of 
stearin, palmitin (nearly 25 per cent.), and 
myristin glycerides, the latter increasing with 
the darker color. So far no controversy has 
arisen beyond the unconfirmed statement of 
Winckler (1852) that glycerin could not be 
obtained from cod- liver oil, which he regarded 
as a whole, containing propyl oxide. Second, 
iodine, in from 0.0012 (Bird) to 0.004 P er 
cent. (De Jongh), its presence first demon- 
strated by De l'Orme, but even now it is not 
known in what form it exists; on the other 
hand, several observers have failed to detect 
it in all specimens. Third, bromine. Fourth, 
phosphorus: as pre-existent phosphoric acid, 
0.0789; as obtained by total oxidation of the 
oil, 0.1047 per cent. (De Jongh). Fifth, sul- 
phur. Sixth, biliary acids. Seventh, free 
acids, calculated as acetic acid, 0.01 to 1.80 
per cent. (Charles, 1882), and regarded as 
butyric and acetic acids by De Jongh (1849). 
It is quite likely that free oleic, palmitic and 
stearic acids exist in the oil. Eighth, gaduin, 
C 35 H 46 9 , identical with morrhuic acid 
(Gautier and Mourgues, 1888), existing as 
an unstable compound resembling lecithin, 
and in contact with acids and alkalies de- 
composing into morrhuic acid, C 9 H 13 N0 3 , 
phosphoric acid and glycerin. Ninth, gadic 
acid (Luck, 1857), deposited from light-brown 
oil. 

Under the name of morrhuolins are in- 
cluded the so-called alkaloids of cod-liver

and Mourgues found, however, in yelloi 
six definite bases: butylamin, amylamin,

and morrhoic and. It will be observed that

stances and tr are concerned, there is

A.S to the so-called alkaloids, or definite 
. there is abundant opportunity for criti- 
cism. It is remarkable that they are most 
abundant in the brown oils, and from these 
mmercially obtained morrhuol, the name 
applied to an alcoholic extractive derivable 
from cod- liver oil and of probably indefinite 
chemical structure. Similarly the term 
duol " has been employed. Presumably mor- 
rhuol, which according to Lafarge (1885) is 
a very aromatic substance of a sharp, bitter 
taste found in b own oils 4.50 to 6.00, yellow 
oils 2.50 to 3.00, and in white oils 1.50 to 2.00 
per cent., contains most of the so-called alka- 
loids, together with the iodine, bromine, and 
pho-phorus, and is the substance which is 
supposed to represent the active principles 
of the oil. 

The physiological properties of the six 
alkaloids have been determined by Gautier 
and Mourgues to be as follows: 

Butylamin: In sufficient doses this produces 
in animals fatigue, stupor, vomiting, and a 
certain degree of paresis. In small doses it 
excites the urinary secretions; in large doses 
it is at the same time convulsive and para- 
lyzing; in medium doses it throws the ani- 
mals into a sort of somnolence, with muscular 
paresis, but with complete conservation of 
the intelligence. Although poisonous, it does 
not produce death unless given in very large 
doses. 

Amylamin: This is a very active base. In 
small doses it excites the reflexes and the 
urinary secretion. In large doses it provokes 
convulsive trembling, then regular convul- 
sions and death. 

Hexylamin acts almost like amylamin, but 
with less intensity. 

Dihydrolutidin is a rather toxic base, even 
in small doses, when it produces a notable 
diminution of sensibility In larger doses it 
provokes trembling and convulsions in the 
muscles of the face. With still larger doses 
in a guinea-pig tne trembling increases and 
becomes more general. Very lively periods 
of excitation are followed by profound de- 



uon with insensibility an - - |

Morrhuin is one of the n ive princi- 

ples of the oil; it is also in larger quantity—

stimulant to the function of nutritn

\s we read the results of the- 
ments, we cannot but be impressed by the 
fact that these symptoms are the symptoms 
of ptomaine poisoning. And when one re- 
members that the process of manufacturing 
hitherto employed is such that putrefaction! 
is an important factor in the product on of 
the oil. as anyone will testify who has visited 
the North Cape, where the stench encoun-i 
tered upon the journey is as prevalent and, 
repulsive as that found near the menhaden- 
rendering works of the Atlantic Coast, the! 
impression becomes a certainty. Without 
doubt, the alkaloids contained in morrhuol 
are putrefactive or cadaveric alkaloids, and 
of these amylamin, asellin, dihydrolutidin are) 
assuredly poisonous and are so classified in 
Gould's table as modified from Vaughan and 
Novy. Amylamin can also be obtained frorni 
horn and from putrid yeast. Morrhuin, as is: 
stated above, is probably diuretic and dia- 
phoretic. Butylamin may or may not be toxic; | 
it is quite probably the latter. That any of I 
these alkaloids are present in cod-liver oil) 
when prepared at the place of the fisheries, 
by a proper process, is extremely doubtful. 
So far as I can learn, no analyses have been 
made of such cod-liver oil. To assume that 
morrhuol represents in any way the active 
therapeutic properties of cod-liver oil, is to 
assume that cod liver oil is useful only in the 
proportion that it is putrefied. My attention 
having been called to the reports of Lafarge 
(1885), and later o( Germain S£e, I experi- 
mented with morrhuol for several months, 
and finally, convinced of its absolute failure, 
I abandoned its use. I was so thoroughly 
positive of its uselessness that the paper of 
Bouillot did not induce me to repeat my ob- 
servations. If there are any medicinal prop- 
erties in the preparations of the so-called 
active principles from which oil is removed,

or which are removed from the oil, they must 
be entirely due to the other substances with 
which they are incorporated. The substitu- 
tion of active principles in place of crude 
drugs is praiseworthy, when it is proved that 
these active principles represent the proper- 
ties of the drug or possess in themselves 
definite physiological action. No digitalin, 
or digitonin, or digitoxin, has yet been iso- 
lated which fully represents digitalis; why 
then need we expect that alkaloids shall 
represent cod-liver oil, even if they arise from 
its putrefaction ? 

To what then can we attribute the bene- 
ficial action of cod-liver oil in wasting dis- 
eases? That cod-liver oil is a food, a food 
of special value, because of its peculiar prop- 
erties. 

To quote Farquharson: "It has been 
proved by experiment that animal are more 
digestible than vegetable oils, and ccd-liver 
oil is the most readily assimilated of all. 
After being emulsified by the pancreatic 
juice it comes in contact with the bile, which 
distinctly increases its power in passing 
through moist animal membrane; and it is 
probable also that the biliary principles in- 
corporated in its own structure aid in en- 
abling it to be easily absorbed by the lacteals. 
Its action in the system is to improve the 
general constitutional tone, to evolve force 
and heat, and to aid in supplying those fatty 
elements which are so essentially requisite 
for the construction and repair of the tissues. 
It supplies the fatty matter on which the 
proper functions ot cell growth and develop- 
ment depend, the nuclei of the cells being 
formed of fat." The free fatty acids con- 
tained also aid in emulsification and absorp- 
tion from the alimentary canal. 

It improves the nutrition and supplies the 
fatty ingredients necessary for the growth 
and repair of the nervous system. It im- 
proves the quality of the blood, increas- 
ing the number of the red corpuscles, and 
strengthens the heart muscle. Although the 
•quantity of iodine, bromine and phosphorus 
is small, so far as their influence goes they 
are of use. Brunton has pointed out that, 
because it nourishes the young epithelial 
cells of the bronchial mucous membrane, en- 
abling them to grow instead of being con- 
verted into pus, it is of undoubted efficacy as 
an expectorant. 

Tno isands of lives would undoubtedly 
have been saved, had the profession under- 
stood that beef tea, as formerly made, con- 
taining scarcely more than the soluble 
extractives, possesses about as much value as 
a nutrient as urine. Shall we now go on to 
administer the extractives of cod-liver oil, 



cadaveric alkaloids of demonstrated poison- 
ous properties— of which the best that can 
be said is that one is diaphoretic and diuretic 
in its action and increases the appetite- and 
discard the real y valuable constituents, 
which make up the food? A tuberculous 
patient can generate a sufficient amount of 
ptomaine without any assistance from the 
physician. It is the prevention of the forma- 
tion, not elimination, that one seeks in treat- 
ment. An analogous procedure would be 
the administration of beef-tea made from 
putrid meat. 

The use of the extractives of cod-liver oil 
is no new idea. In 1866 an extract, an evapo- 
rated watery extract, made from the livers in 
preparing the oil, was used. It soon fell into 
disuse. Granting that the ptomaines of pu- 
trid oil are harmless — which is as yet by no 
means proven, for the quantity in which they 
have been administered has been too small 
for any definite conclusion, — if there are any 
remedial propertes in the extracts or wines 
it must be in the substances incorporated 
with them, but which are better administered 
separately. 

How then shall we prescribe cod-liver oil? 
By emulsions, which are heavily charged with 
mucilage and contain water which favors 
rancidity? Of all which I have used — and 
every one which I could obtain has been 
used in my hospital and dispensary service — 
but one has been satisfactory, and that only 
when freshly made. For fourteen years I 
have used an oil of which the only recom- 
mendation it claimed was that it was obtained 
from fresh livers by cold expression. It was 
of American origin, and on that account was 
not obtained from the cod when in as good 
condition as when off the shores of Norway. 
As it was, its use was far more satisfactory 
than that of emulsions or mixtures of what- 
ever sort. 

During the past few months I have used 
with great satisfaction the Improved Lofoten 
Cod-liver Oil made by Parke, Davis &amp; Com- 
pany, which is simply an oil obtained on the 
site of the fisheries from the livers of the fish 
at the time they are taken from the water. 
The process of manufacture is carefully 
carried out so that absolute cleanliness and 
freshness of the material shall be secured and 
that no decomposition shall take place. The 
disagreeable odor and flavor is removed, bat 
no constituent important for its use as a food 
is taken out. Specimens kept for months 
have as yet shown no change. The problem 
seems to be solved. A food to be of its high- 
est usefulness must be palatable; the most 
weighty objection is now done away with. 

The oil should be given during the height

increatic digestion, one to two hours 
eating, so that it may pass 

itomach ami be absorbed ilurmg intes- 
tinal digestion. Tl i should be watcbed 
that more shall not be administered than can 

be absorbed. If the oil should "repeat," a 

fact winch I have not as yet observed, .t 

of ether added to the dose is likely to 

obviate that difficulty. 'The dose is fro:: 

ispoonfuls. My conclusions are: 

Cod-liver oil is a food, important be 
of its peculiar properties: 

Since it is a food, no extractive can repre- 
sent its value: 

The purer the oil — the more free from 
cadaveric alkaloids— the more palatable will 
it be and the better adapted for its puq 

The best that can be said of the cadaveric 
alkaloids is that they may possibly represent 
its eliminative, they certainly do not repre- 
sent its reconstructive, properties: 

It is not proven that the administration of 
appreciable quantities of the cadaveric alka- 
loids is devoid of danger. — Doctor R. W. 
Wilcox. 



Physiology ok the Carbohydrates. — 
In the Croonian Lectures for 1894 Doctor 
Paw dealt a severe blow at the glycogenic 
function of the liver. In his introduction, 
Doctor Pavy first discussed the physiology 
of the carbohydrates, the dehydration of 
carbohydrates by physiolog'cal action, the 
destination of starch in the plant, and the 
origin of proteids by incorporation of carbo- 
hydrates. He then proceeded to sketch the 
steps by which he had been led to the con- 
clusion that a carbohydrate could be ob- 
tained from the cleavage of a proteid body 
by chemical means available in the labora- 
tory. Finally he arrived at a method of 
treating egg albumen which yielded a carbo- 
hydrate body readily soluble in water, yield- 
ing no coloration with iodine, and possessing 
no cupric-oxide reducing power. In his sec- 
ond lecture he commented on the glucoside 
constitution of proteid matter; showed that 
carbohydrate could also be cleaved off from 
the proteid by ferment action; and discussed 
the part played by the proteids in nutrition, 
and the conversion of carbohydrates into 
fat. The conclusions reached so far were to 
be summed up in the following: Not only 
can carbohydrate matter be hydrated by fer- 
ment and chemical action, but when in these 
conditions of increased hydration it can be 
transmuted by dehydration, under the influ- 
ence of protoplasmic action, into substances 
having more complex molecules — amyloses: 
In both the vegetable and animal kingdoms 



carb - take part in the synth&lt; 

rbohydrates are, under the in fid 
i. transformed infl 

The acceptance of this position involved 
the abandonment of the glycogenic tl 
which taught that carbohydrate mattei 

derrd soluble by hydration in the alinu 
canal, was carried by the portal vein t*. tin 
liver, there to be m part stored, ami eventual! 

permitted to escape from the liver in 
hepatic veins, from which it reached th&lt; 
eral circulation, and through it the system! 
Capillaries, for disposal in the tissues in 
unknown manner. The theory was sup; 
by the contentions: That the liver is mort 
saccharine than other organs: That the blood 
leaving it contains more sugar than the por- 
tal veins: That the blood on the venoi 
of the systemic capillaries contains les- 
than on the arterial side. 

All these statements had now been shown tc 
be incorrect. It might, indeed, be affirmed not 
only that there was no support for the glyco- 
genic theory, but that it was incompatible 
with the observed order of things in the ani-l 
mal economy. — British Medical Journal. 



Tm Structuri of the Palatine GlandJ 

— At a meeting of the Pathological Society 
(London), Mr. S. G. Shattock exhibited a 
tumor of the palate which in structure re- 
sembled the growths of the parotid and sub 
maxillary glands. This raised the question 
whether the palatine and labial glands in 
man were salivary. Mr. Shattock made a 
number of experiments by finely mincing 
gland tissue, triturating with weak starch so- 
lution, and then placing the mixture in an 
incubator at the temperature of the body 
The results were tested by the action o 
iodine solution, care having been taken thai 
any acid reaction of the glands had bee 
originally neutralized. The presence of 
ptyalin was demonstrated in only a few in 
stances — two children and one adult. The 
question has an interest from a dental point 
of view, for if the glands, or some of them, 
situated upon the hard palate should be 
proved to possess some amount of amylolytic 
function, they can scarcely act to the best 
advantage when a complete upper denture 
covers the roof of the mouth. — British Jour 
rial of Dental Science.

SIMPLE REHITTENT FEVER.* 

BY DOCTOR JOAO VINCENTE TORRES HOMEM. 

With us the malarial infection is usually 
manifested by a simple pyrexia of remittent 
type. Except the absence of an apyretic 
stage, in which the thermometer reveals a 
normal temperature, this nosological species 
does not show the slightest difference from 
intermittent fever. In a certain number of 
cases the fever, which was at the beginning 
intermittent, becomes remittent, and this 
ordinarily takes place when the patient is not 
properly treated or abandons the disease to 
the sole resources of nature. At other times 
we observe the converse; the pyrexia begins 
with the remittent type and after the use of 
a few doses of quinine the paroxysms become 
manifestly periodic. 

There is nothing particular as regards aeti- 
ology and symptoms, in remittent that is not 
applicable to intermittent fever. In place 
of complete apyrexia, thermometric examin- 
ation shows that there is barely diminution 
of febrile heat; this diminution is almost 
always one or two degrees (Centigrade) 
and appears from 6 to S a.m. or 3 to 4 p.m.; 
lit coincides sometimes with the presence of 
jsome perspiration on the forehead and neck; 
but at other times, despite the lowering of the 
I temperature, the skin remains dry. It is not 
rare for the fall of fever to take place in the 
(early dawn, and thus to pass unnoticed by 
the physician and the persons who take care 
of the patient; if there is no perspiration to 
indicate the remission, and if the thermometer 
ibe not employed, the practitioner may be led 
nto error, unless he is accustomed to observe 
:he fevers of our country, especially if he 



attaches too much importance to the infor- 
mation given by the nurses. 

To arrive at the diagnosis of simple ma- 
larial remittent fever the physician should 
pay attention, first, to the absence of any 
visceral lesion which can explain the febrile 
reaction present; second, to the results of 
thermometric investigation, which reveals a 
lowering of temperature of one or two de- 
grees (Centigrade) at certain fixed hours: 
third, to the furred state of the tongue, the 
upper surface of this organ appearing as if 
it had been whitewashed;* fourth, to the con- 
gestion and sensitiveness of the liver and 
spleen; fifth, finally, in some cases, to the 
splenic pain to which Doctor Debove attaches 
so much importance. It is needless to men- 
tion the diagnostic value of the knowledge 
furnished by anamnesis, for this element dom- 
inates the entire history of malarial fevers, 
and is the first to sink into the mind of even 
the most inexperienced physician. 

Simple remittent fever, once recognized at 
its commencement and suitably combated, 
terminates by recovery in a few days. After 
the first few doses of quinine, either the fever 
ceases at once, with the appearance of a fresh 
paroxysm, or the type of the pyrexia changes 
and the patient is attacked by one or two in- 
termittent paroxysms before recovering. 

After previously removing the gastro- 
intestinal disorder, which almost always ex- 
ists, quinine is employed, in the dose of 
eighteen to twenty-four grains (one gramme 
to twelve decigrammes) at the time of the 
diminution of the febrile heat. In some 
cases the period of remission is so brief, so 
transitory, that the physician needs to be

there was not the slightest difficulty in recog-

Case i — Manoel Suzano, Portuguese, aged 
thirty-eight, recently arrived in Brazil, ser- 
vant, lives in an unhealtnful cortico* of the 
Praia Formosa, where he fell ill on ihe after- 
noon of the i ith of June, 1S72. Two hours 
after dining he was seized with a moderate 
chill, nausea, and afterward vomiting, reject- 
ing the food he had swallowed; he went 10 
bed, and an intense fever set in, accompanied 
by frontal headache. He took two cups of 
an infusion of laurel leaves and orange buds. 
convinced that he had an indigestion, and 
thus passed the whole night. The next day 
the fever and pain in the head continued, a 
dull pam appeared in the right hypochon- 
drium, and the urine became very scanty and 
high-colored. The patient came on the 13th, 
at 7 a m., to the Mizericordia Hospital and 
was assigned a bed in the Santa Izabel (clin- 
ical medicine) ward. 

He presented the following symptoms: 
Face flushed; eyes a little injected; axillary 
temperature 102. 6°; pulse no and strong; 
tongue much coated; anorexia, thirst, nausea 
from time to time; bowels constipated; epi- 
gastric sensitiveness; liver a little enlarged 
and painful on pressure and percussion; 
spleen normal; urine scanty, very high-colored, 
and free from albumen. The other organs 
in normal condition. 

In view of the information given by the 
patient, saying that his fever dated from 6 p.m. 
of the 1 ith, without ever leaving him, I diag- 
nosed malarial remittent fever. Recommend- 
ed the internes to take his temperature at 1 
and 5 P.M. Made the following prescription:

quinine up to the 13th. 

In this second case the fever yielded more 
promptly to the quinine than in the first, not- 
withstanding there having been previously a 
series of quotidian intermittent paroxysms, 
attended by congestion of the liver and spleen.

MEDICINE AMONG THE JEWS. 

BY RABBI LOUIS GROSSMAN, D.D. 

The fight between religion and science has 
been settled; the clergy, who are rarely 
graceful and never gracious in polemics, have 
had to make the amende honorable. They 
have submitted to the inevitable with a cer- 
tain kind of suavity, which reflects credit at 
least on its tardy tact. On the other hand, 
it is refreshing to notice that the fraternity 
of scientists has given an anxious band of 
pastors a compensating surprise. Far from 
displaying a reckless skepticism or an unre- 
generate heterodoxy, which theologians were 
sure was implicit in scientific pursuits, scien- 
tists (especially unavoidable physicians) have 
been found to be neither irreligious nor irre- 
sponsible. On the contrary, an ingenuous 
deference has arisen between clergy and 
scientists such as doctors, whom they meet 
not infrequently in the conscientious per- 
formance of a helpful profession; each was 
dispossessed of prejudgments. The one came 
to see that polemics as to speculation was 
not so important, after all, and that solemn 
unction could not do much; the other found 
that bravado might be condoned in a begin- 
ner, but was unworthy of the mature and the 
earnest. Both found that they were not ex- 
clusive of each other; that, in fact, religion 
and science are supplementary one of the 
other. Some physicians, for instance, have 
displayed a heroism and a noble martyrdom 
I'm the cause of the world's good and prog- 
ress, not a whit less grand and holy than that 
of mediaeval monk or ascetic, perhaps in ser- 
vice somewhat more substantial. Science, 
• too, has touched our aspects of life and has 
enhanced them, has made us more apprecia- 
tive of life; has brought us into the presence 
oi the majesty of organism, into the mystery 



of the cell, which is as profound and sublime 
as any theology tantalized us with. We see 
now the glories of creation not only through 
the illusive poetry of faith, but also in the 
very things with which we are busy in our 
prosy lives. The very dust at our feet is re- 
plete with meaning now. The search after 
God is now a holy business, not a barren 
ecstasy. The mediocre may indulge in indo- 
lent composure; but we know that they have 
only that modicum of religion which such 
listlessness in a world of living wonders can 
have. A loftier aspiration, however, an in- 
tellectual alertness, a hunger, an insatiable 
thirst to know, to see the beautiful— that 
alone brings truth, brings God. 

Theologians and scientists are beginning 
to have respect for one another. A little mis- 
understanding is, after all, not an unmixed 
evil. Of course we all regret that this mu 
tual distrust brought us so much mischief. 
The church cast out some of its most valu- 
able men, and made enemies of them, whereas 
these might have been its profitable helpers. 
Religion got into ill-repute and the churches 
were shorn of their most efficient servants. 
Theology is, in itself, a very respectable bit 
of earnest poetry, but its magnificence was 
cheapened by the fuss of babblers who had 
more zeal than love. Still we are glad that 
the mischief these did was in the end not 
irreparable. Men of inventive idealism in a 
real, not fantastic world, must inevitably en- 
rich mankind some day. The delay to let 
sound judgment, exercised in a sound world, 
prevail, was expensive to us all, to be sure; 
but we are over "the late unpleasantness" 
and willing to let " bygones be bygones." 
Perhaps there was a compensating good in 
it. Both have gotten the wholesome lesson 
of moderation. We extend hands to each 
other for comradeship, and we can begin 
some sort of concerted action. Thoughtful 
people were all along heartily ashamed of 
the indefensible obstinacy which zealots sup- 
posed to be ardor, and they knew there was 
enough of usefulness on both sides — on the 
side of the Voltaires and the Buechners as 
much as on the side of the Jonathan Ed- 
wardses and the John Calvins; and perhaps 
they would have liked to unlearn history. 
But we really need be ashamed of nothing. 
The doings of Providence are justifiable at

all time&gt;. and only those find fault or apolo-

he still remains a boy. I shall never blame

good cause ought to intoxicate those who 
drink at its source. Exuberance of spirit is 
perhaps the only capital which pioneers have. 

'Hie hygienic significance of a day of rest 
is not the least of the points made by the 
churches for securing a respect for any ob- 
servance of the Sabbath. It has not been 
made out as yet that the continued strain of 
a week's labor does not act deleteriously on 
the health of the organism; and even the 
laity feel that just as virile exercise of the 
functions in a methodic manner is an ab- 
solute necessity, so also an incessant and 
unrelieved slavery of the organism entails 
functional exhaustions, and that a host of 
general diseases, such as consumption, dia- 
betes, etc., may have some germinal source 
in continuous labor, which taxes with an 
equal amount of force-expenditure the heter- 
ogeneous organs, which have various degrees 
of reactive power and may thread out in en- 
ergy therefore in unequal ways. The Day 
of God, consecrated by biblical tradition, is 
still the most eminent instance (not only the 
most ancient) of a prophylactic institution 
of social hygiene. 

In fact the Decalogue gives hints of the 
fact that Moses was not only a discriminating 
connoisseur of the niceties of speculation, 
passion, and will, but that he also was saga- 
cious in matters of public interest and public 
necessity as to life and health, which, if left 
to even the best-intentioned whim of the in- 
dividual, it would be hard to conserve. The 
only way in which religion can substantiate its 
claims on the good will and the good sense of 
the people is when it proves that it helps them 
in an organizing, a constructive, a statesman- 



like manner to maintain and to promote the 
healthy life of the largest number of the 
people. 

I think - 1 sit in judgment 

on the founders, as well as on th . aes, 

religion, and award to them not sfmply ad- 
miration for personal charms of intellect or 
pathos, for pleasing us aesthetically or philo- 
phically; but we shall endeavor to make 
out for ourselves how much they knew of the 
social significance which is inevitably impli- 
cated in large movements and in world- 
action. It is not the least interesting bit in 
the biography of M«»ses and Jesus, and in 
the legendary account of even the humblest 
Messiah of African and American abo- 
rigines, that they were medicine-men, and 
it is our privilege to put not only a new but a 
more appreciative estimate on their fame, if 
we shall make clear to what extent they 
thought of the health of the body, strove to 
arrange social conditions so as to bring a 
'salutary effect on the vigor of the average 
man and woman, and to what efficient use 
they turned religion for hygienic profit and 
for the permanent health of the race. 

The Pentateuch comprises sanitary arrange- 
ments, the emulation of which, though they 
are rudimentary, would do no small credit 
to our own more progressed time. Moses 
knows, for example, of the disinfecting qual- 
ity of the soil; he knows of public sanitation; 
he knows of the great danger to public 
health which lies in the negligent exposure 
of offal and of putrid stuff. "And a place 
shalt thou have without the camp whither 
thou shalt go forth abroad. And a spade 
shalt thou have with thy weapons; and it 
shall be that when thou sittest abroad, that 
thou shalt dig therewith and shalt afterward 
cover that which cometh forth from thee." 
(Deut., XXIII, 13-14.) 

In Leviticus a number of what are called 
leprous diseases are enumerated, from the 
spread of which there is a constant danger to 
a community (13, 2-3). The priest is told 
to make a diagnosis — think of it: a diagnosis, 
and that made by a priest ! And this is no j 
mean diagnosis, I think. The language iM^ 
quaint, but we can make a very sensible mean- j 
ing out of it. The patient is brought before 
the priest; this one inspects the obvious symp- 
toms. The hair about the wound, or lacer-

ated or erupted part — is it white (has it lost 
its pigment) ? Is the affected portion sunk 
deeper than the surrounding — in modern 
technical phraseology, is there a degenera- 
tion of cellular tissue? The priest is to de- 
clare the patient unclean, and he is to be 
isolated for seven days. At the expiration 
of this enforced " isolation" the priest-doctor 
subjects the patient to another diagnosis. If 
the erupted part has become pale — that is, if 
the recuperative energy has failed and there 
has been no reconstruction of the tissue — 
then it is fair to presume that the circulatory 
system either has become impoverished or 
has failed. He is unclean; it is an eruption. 
He must then, after the issue of his disease, 
perform ablution, offer a sacrifice— a solemn 
seal to a matter which would be conceived of 
more light-mindedly if it had the sanction of 
the utilitarian aspect alone. 

The patient who has been found really 
affected tears his clothes, uncovers his head, 
and cries: "Unclean, unclean!" (a better 
placard has not been invented). "He shall 
remain solitary without the camp." When 
ready for disinfection and for restoration to 
the camp, he washes his clothes, cuts off his 
hair, bathes in water, and still remains seven 
da\ s longer outside of his tent. On the seventh 
day he repeats the ablutionary procedure, and 
then at last he may be held as clean. 

We have here primitive inspection, isola- 
tion, quarantine, disinfection. But there is 
more — Moses knew of infection, contagion, 
and, I say boldly, of disease-germs. If the 
priest had discovered a sign of leprosy (such!) 
on any garment of wool, linen, or leather, or 
any other wearing apparel, the suspected 
garment had to be kept apart, to be reex- 
amined after seven days (it was in the days 
when the industrial arts were in their in- 
fancy, and none could afford to destroy 
expensive garments). If the traces of sus- 
picion had then enlarged, it was leprosy. 
" When the plague of leprosy is on a house 
of the land of your possession, then shall 
he that owneth the house come and tell 
the priest, saying, Something like a leprosy 
hath shown itself to me in the house. And 
the priest shall command that they clear 
out the house, before the priest shall go into 
it to see the plague, that all be not made 
unclean that is in the house [a commendable 



prophylaxis, which modern physicians can 
afford to heed who pass from venereal pa- 
tients to diphtheritic ones, and from harm- 
lessly afflicted to the most criminally afflicted 
without much scrupulous forethought!] and 
after this shall the priest go into the house. 
And he shall view the plague, and behold if 
the plague be in the walls of the house, in 
depressions [chinks, we would say], dark 
green, or dark red, and their appearance be 
deeper than the wall [that is, lying in spots 
not so easily detected],* then shall the priest 
go out of the house to the door of the house 
and lock up the house seven days. And the 
priest shall come again on the seventh day, 
and if he see that, behold, the plague has 
spread in the walls of the house [how ances- 
tral the bacteria theory is!], then shall the 
priest command that they break out the 
stones on which the plague is, and they shall 
cast them forth without the city in an un- 
clean place. And the house he shall cause 
to be scraped within round about, and they 
shall pour out the rubbish that they have 
scraped off without the city in an unclean 
place.f And they shall take other stones 
and put them in place of these stones, and 
the mortar he shall take [Moses seems to 
fear the treacherous pores in lumber, stones, 
and brick] and shall plaster the house afresh. 
And if the plague come again and break 
out in the house, after he hath taken away 
the stones and after the house hath been 
scraped ad after it hath been plastered, 
then shall the priest come, and if he see 
that, behold, the plague hath spread in 
the house, it is a corrosive leprosy in the 
house, it is unclean. And he shall break 
down the house, and the timbers thereof, 
and all the mortar of the house, and he 
shall carry them forth to without the city, 
unto an unclean place. And he that goeth 
into the house all the days that it is locked 



*If our Health Board had been a little more 
pious, and had read their Bible before they sent 
out the contractor to build the Eruptive Disease 
Hospital, lives would have been saved. 

f We in our day could emulate the biblical 
example with much profit. I have a suspicion 
against the conventional papered room and against 
oiled walls and against the dangerous absorptive 
coatings of ceilings and walls. A scraping here and 
there would harm very few modern households!

THE MKDICAL AGE. 



np shall be andean until the evening. And 

be that lieth in the house shall wash his 
clothe so he that eateth in the hoi. 

Finally, after a sacrifice (to give religious 
sanction ami prestige to the very important 
work) "the priest shall take [notice this pro- 
vision, a quite creditable if not absolutely effec- 
tive process of disinfection] cedar wood and 

hyssop, and the scarlet yarn and the living 
bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain 
bird [the sacrificial animal] and in the run- 
ning brook, and sprinkle on the house." (In 
other words, the disinfectant is a mixture of 
vegetable and animal matter: vegetable mat- 
ter as a preservative, hyssop as a deodorizer.) 
In Chapter XIX it is provided that a stock of 
disinfecting fluid be kept constantly on hand. 
The greatly offending but embarrassingly 
small animalculae and most modern microbe 
miscreants, we find, are old familiar acquaint- 
ances of Moses. I depone as a layman, that 
the ancient lawgiver (or for him and in his 
name somebody later, but not less sagacious) 
knew a thing or two about medicine and diag- 
nosis and of those esoteric matters of which 
you know expertly both the grand importance 
and the social significance. Moses had no 
microscope, but he had a superb instinct and 
a keen, watchful, and conscientious eye on 
the traditions and experiences of the world. 

The best known Jewish provision as to hy- 
giene is that of circumcision. I wish more 
time and better information were at my dis- 
posal to speak of this great tradition in Juda- 
ism. I must be concise and content myself 
with making laical statements about it. The 
purpose in this surgical operation, I take it, 
lies in a subtle ambition to combat the ter- 
rible curse of venereal disease, or, to put it in 
a more positive phrase, to come to the rescue 
of an undisciplined passion which is the germ 
of the legitimate and inevitable function of 
propagation. The great value of circumci- 
sion lies, it seems to me, in the first place in 
the fact that the removal of the foreskin re- 
duces the sharp craving by early exposure, 
and the consequent early hardening miti- 
gates the provocation to venereal indulgence; 
in the second place, the freeing from an un- 
necessary tegument relieves the duct, which 
otherwise might be hampered; in the third 
place, it accommodates cleanliness and has 
an all-around prophylactic importance. It is 



a fact that as long as the modern leu 
spec-ted this traditional custom of circunu 
sion (disrespect to it is rare, even in th&lt; 
dav.s) they had a fortunate immunity from the 
decimating and noisome diseases and vices; 
the small number of cases of congenital dis- 
ease, and the infrequency of insanity, can be 
traced among jews to this initial precaution. 
Perhaps also we ought to put our moral 
estimate upon the sexual instinct from the 
sociological standpoint. The passion is not 
a gift of the devil, but a function, which can 
be (and we shall some day see, must be) in 
the service of what is valuable and chaste in 
the race. The perpetuation of life, the sanc- 
tity of marital cohabitation, and all the vir- 
tues and worthy delights which come from 
home and through home, all along the pro- 
gressive line of childhood and parenthood, 
are brought to all of us and to all who come 
successively upon the earth to share in its 
life and its pleasures and in its rich unfolding 
of beauty, of truth and goodness, by the pure 
and healthy way in which we have empow- 
ered man and woman to minister in this 
world-maintaining function. There is no 
higher aspiration in mortal man, in prophet 
or in statesman, to serve his race better and 
more enduringly, to the unfailing reward of 
immortal fame in the midst of a thoughtful 
mankind, than to succeed in giving us such a 
doctrine, law and custom as shall endow the 
lowest of our passions with an ennobling 
significance, and by his tact and his discre- 
tion and his legislation to raise our organic 
necessities and defensible indulgences into 
holy and beneficent functions. 

We are prudish, nowadays, despite out 
intelligent convictions. We know that some- 
thing must be done in order to breed a better, 
a sturdier race; but we are oversen itive, we 
trip up our modest feet. The facts stare 
every observer in the face. The immorality 
of the present day, the laxness, even in cir- 
cles in which fidelity and confidence before 
were intense, and the scandal of irresponsible 
womanhood and manhood (which latter is 
often allowed a riotousness which even the re- 
fined members of society agree not to speak 
of), have so inured us to reserve and extreme 
distrust, that agitation in the matter is simply 
impossible; the handling of a sweeping- broom 
and the dusting of a garbage-wagon are 



THE MEDICAL AGE.

unaesthetic bits of business to which we will 
always stoop ungracefully and unwillingly. 
But think of this! Moses promulgates a 
law in Israel as to the sexual instinct, and 
Jewish tradition enforces it with publicity, 
and still, despite the unaesthetic and plain 
publication of it, the moral sense of no Jew 
all along has ever been shocked by it, nor 
has his passion been whetted by it; nay, he 
has rather been chastened by it. How much 
we modern people of etiquette and formali- 
ties can learn from the rugged and natural 
sense of the ancients, and how have even the 
leaders of our religions fallen from the grand 
heights of prophets not only in idealism but 
also in practical sense! 

I have not spoken of the marital laws, 
which come more properly under the care of 
the physician than under the speculation of 
the theologian. These, too, deserve a fuller 
treatment, and I regret that I must satisfy 
myself with simply referring to them with a 
fugitive but respectful notice. Perhaps a 
considerable number of necessary divorces 
can be accounted for on other than church 
lines, and it is not improbable that if our 
legislators, who are theologically conditioned 
and churchily prepossessed more than they 
are aware (because opinions are matters of 
instinct as well as of training), would inform 
themselves of the sociological sense of law, 
they would be readier to clip the wings of 
freedom in some cases, and slower in others 
to weight them down. 

One provision of the Mosaic dispensation 
is worth a special remark. Moses provides 
that a man who has recently married a 
woman shall not go into war within one year 
after his marriage. Moses knew that the 
soldiery constituted the most virile part of 
the people, and he wished to conserve the 
sturdy quality of their reproductive capaci- 
ties. What wars have done toward depriving 
the nations of their most healthful stock and 
of the vital germs of other possible lives, we 
can surmise. 

If you wish to have additional instances of 
the way in which Moses economized life and 
germ, both mature and infant, read Chapters 
XV and XVIII of Leviticus. They are re- 
plete with precautionary measures of such 
obvious truth as to physiology, hygiene, and 
implied morals, that we do not know which to 



admire most, the versatility or the ingenuity 
or the organizing power of the man, leader, 
prophet. 

It is possible that much of that which is 
now ascribed to primeval Moses is really a 
tradition which accumulated through the his- 
tory of the race and acquired a growing 
prestige and influence. This would involve 
questions of literary criticism and of his- 
torical precision. It would in no way affect 
the value of the matter we have spoken of. 
The people of Israel maintained the pro- 
visions, and obeyed, not only voluntarily but 
also advisedly and to the degree of religious- 
ness, the wise and helpful ^1 might almost 
say necessary) laws; if they liked to make 
them more august in repute by ascribing the 
origin of them to a great man who lived, or 
who was thought to have lived, long ago, 
that they had a right to hold as they felt 
piously inclined to do. But it is an unques- 
tioned credit to the people of Israel that 
these laws and customs were held in great 
esteem by them, and that, in spite of the 
skeptical touch which every later century puts 
upon every antecedent one, they continued 
uninterruptedly with undiminished fidelity to 
conform their personal and communal inter- 
ests and needs to these traditions Here the 
history of Israel has a feature of interest and 
of worth to posterity.

Although I have taken up so much time with 
an account of the School of Salernum, a few 
words must be devoted to the School of 
Montpellier, which was second in time and 
in importance among the great influences in 
the culture of Western Europe. There was 
a time when to have studied there lent a 
special halo of glory, for, being near the sea 
and in the vicinity of thermal baths, even so 
early as a.d. 1153 it was famous as a school

of medicine; moreover, those who presided 
over u did not lapse unconditionally into the 

church or into mediaeval philosophy with its 
bewildering subtleties. It is said to have 

founded a d. 738, but first mention of 
iree of med cal education occurs in 

137, when Bishop Adelbcrt 11., of Ma\ • 

I the city q to its medical teach- 

\ : . I y • philosophy was added in 
124a, and one of law in 1298. Within the 
walls of the city sojourned both Christians 
and Jews, the latter being subject directly to 
the civil authorities, and particularly esteeme I 
as translators. One of the most famous of 
the sons of Israel was ProfaHus fudicus % who 
became a rector of the faculty. 

Prior to 1370, when the university became 
subject to the kings of France, it was under 
the control of the Pope; and then, as now, 
the school of medicine was the chief orna- 
ment of this ancient seat of learning. 

One of the most illustrious and famous 
pupils of Montpellier was that religious 
mystic and alchemistic visionary, Raimond 
Lull, or Lulli, a would-be transmuter of 
metals and seeker for the philosopher's 
stone. Born in 1234, at the age of thirty he 
began to see visions, and was thereby roused 
from an atheistic tendency to soon become 
wonderfully pious; ultimately he entered the 
order of Minorites, studied Arabic, and ap- 
peared as a missionary in Africa, seeking to 
convert the Saracens — who, however, declined 
the honor and finally (in 13 15) rewarded his 
zeal by stoning him to death. Beside works 
on alchemy and theology, he wrote on med- 
ical subjects, and, like all great minds of the 
period, passed among the common people as 
a sorcerer in league with the devil. Never- 
theless he was a notable figure in his age and 
country. 

Quite celebrated became the compendium 
of Cilbert of England (1290), which con- 
tained the same speculative nonsense, the 
same polypharmacy, and the same supersti- 
tion as other works of that time; what little 
it contained of value was taken largely 
from other writers. While this Gilbert, often 
known as Gilbertus Anglicus, was not the first 
English writer on practical medicine, he was 
the earliest whose works have been preserved. 

Still more famous was John Gaddesden, 
physician in ordinary to the King of England, 



in Merton College, Oxford, who 
the famous treatise known . 

which appeared between 1305 and 
ttis&lt; was characterized by 
mysticism and disj therapeutic meas- 

and tainted l&gt;y medical avarice, super- 
stition, and charlatanry. Gaddesden was 
perhaps the first to formally recommend the 
"laying on of hands" by the king for the 
cure of scrofula (first performed by Edward 
the Confessor, 1042-1056), whence comes 
the ancient name for this dis e. "king's 

evil "* 

Arnold de Villeneuve $13) studied 

seven years at Montpellier, twenty years at 
Paris, visited all the universities in Italy, 
then went to Spain to levy on the Arabian 
authors He wrote on medicine, theology, 
and especially on chemistry — in which art he 
obtained great renown both as an author and 
teacher. To him is due the discovery of spirit 
of wine, oil of turpentine, aromatic waters, 
besides several preparations of less note, and 
the introduction of chemical compounds into 
therapeutics. His was a very stirring life, 
for he traveled extensively; he became a 
teacher at Bologna, and physician to Peter 
III. of Arragon. Shortly before his demise 
he went to Paris, having fallen under the ban 
because of a declaration that papal bulls, far 
from being sacredly inspired, were human 
works, and that acts of charity were dearer to 
God than hecatombs, etc. He finally per- 
ished by shipwreck, but the spirit of fanati- 
cism followed him after death, for his 
volumes were condemned by the Inquisition, 
because they promoted experiments rather 
than mere speculations. In spite of his gen- 
eral honesty, in accordance with the spirit of 
the times he inculcated deceit in medicine, 
and one of his declarations is: " If thou canst 
not find anything in the examination of the 
renal secretion, declare that an obstruction of 
the liver exists. Particularly use the word 
'obstruction,' since it is not understood, and 
it is of great importance that people should 
not understand what thou sayest." He was 
one of the first to administer brandy, which 
he regarded as the elixir of life — whence the 
modern "Eau de Vie" 



* A special "Service of Healing" was used in 
the English Church under Henry VIII., 1484-1509. 



THE MEDICAL AGE.

Connected with this school also, or well 
known as having studied there, were many 
men whose names became more or less 
famous: among them John Arden, who set- 
tled in London about the middle of the four- 
teenth century; Vinario, a contemporary of 
Guy de Chauliac; and the well known sur- 
geon and anatomist Henri de Mondeville, 
who was a teacher of Guy de Chauliac. But 
an idea of the doctrines prevalent in the 
medical literature of this part of the world, 
at this time, may be had from the fact that 
most writers chose titles for their works after 
the style of ballad-singers; for instance, those 
describing the plague and venereal diseases 
were called u Flowers and Lilies of Medicine;' 
the " Rosa Anglica " of John Gaddesden was 
another example. Matters had arrived at 
such a pass, indeed, that men of science no 
longer hesitated to confess superstition and 
mingle it openly with deceit, to oppose the 
interests of the most needy, and to extort 
from their fellow-creatures fees in proportion 
to their supposed ability to pay. 

In the time of Charlemagne each cathe- 
dral possessed a school in which were taught 
arithmetic, theology, singing, and sometimes 
medicine; the episcopal college had medical 
teachers who gave advice and dressed 
wounds at the doors of the church of Notre 
Dame, Paris; but when the medical profes- 
sion had been divorced from the sacerdotal, 
by councils and popes, many of these cathe- 
dral schools closed. In order to preserve the 
jurisdiction which they for a long time had 
exercised over the learned professions, many 
were erected into universities, and thus the 
clergy gave instruction in philosophy, theol- 
ogy, and later in medicine. During the 
thirteenth century arose many of the great 
universities in Europe, notably those of Bo- 
logna, Padua, and Naples, in Italy; of Paris, 
Montpellier, and Toulouse, in France; of 
Valencia and Tortosa, in Spain; of Oxford, 
in England. Pope Innocent III. by papal 
bull guaranteed that the professors and stu- 
dents at Paris should be exempt from all 
excommunications save those which eman- 
ated directly from the Holy See; French 
sovereigns conferred many privileges upon 
the universities, and soon the members of 
the University of Paris formed practically a 
second city, with its own laws, customs, po- 



lice, citizens, and magistrates. Still, however, 
all science belonged to the clergy, and its 
teachers, though removed from the cloister, 
were none the less Roman Catholic, so that 
the popes reigned over the people through 
the parish clergy, and over the latter by the 
clerical teachers and professors. Neverthe- 
less, in all candor it must be acknowledged 
that these studious men, thus associated 
together for mutual instruction and emula- 
tion in learning, contributed in a large meas- 
sure to elevate Christian civilization above 
all others, though several generations were 
required to secure results calculated to make 
men celebrated; hence the early periods of 
the universities developed very few names. 
Many were conspicuous by their love of in- 
struction, but not by originality of research. 
Men undertook expensive and wearisome 
voyages without encouragement or hope of 
reward, simply to obtain some rare manu- 
script or to hear some renowned professor; 
and they appeal to us of the nineteenth cen- 
tury by their devotion, if not by the results of 
their work. 

Among the somewhat scattered and more 
or less eminent men of this period was 
Gerard, of Cremona in Lombardy, a man of 
great purity and studiousness, who arduously 
pursued all that Latin authors could teach 
him, and, not being able to procure in Italy 
certain manuscripts which dated from the 
time of Ptolemy, determined to go to Toledo 
in search of an Arabian translation. At this 
time he was unacquainted with Arabic, but 
soon mastered it, and, armed with this 
powerful resource — which no other physician 
had possessed since the time of Constantine 
the African — he could not see so many 
Arabic works devoted to all branches of 
science as were gathered at the Spanish 
University, without a desire to translate and 
transmit the same to his own country; hence 
he gave the remainder of his life to this 
work. He rendered into Latin the treatises 
of Hippocrates and Galen, of Serapion, and 
of all the famous Arabian authors from the 
time of Rhazes, including the Canon of 
Avicenna and the work on surgery by Albu- 
casis. He died at the age of seventy-three, 
in 1 187, at Cremona, and left all his books to 
the monastery of St. Lucy, within whose 
walls he was buried.

a professor in the

medicine, ami earned 

geon that preserves his fame to the pi

literature depends in in the 

fact that be was perhaps the first to refuse 
slavish obedience to preceding auth&lt; - 
preferring, Instead, to draw upon the n 

Of personal Study and experience. He died 
in 12S0. 

Lanfranc, or Lanfranchi (according to 

whether one prefers his French or Italian 
name), studied under William of Salicet. I I 

- arly life very little is known, save that 
he practiced surgery In Milan at the time of 
the great dissension between the Guelphs 
and Ghibellines, and, attaching himself to 
the weaker party, was exiled and forced to 
seek an asylum in France; he resided in 
Lyons for several years, and here wrote a 
work on minor surgery; in 1295 he went to 
Paris on the invitation of the faculty of med- 
icine, opened a course on surgery which met 
with great success, and then published a 
second and larger treatise on the subject. It 
is said of him by Malgaigne that, less from his 
fault perhaps than that of his age, after his 
death (about 13 15) surgery began to decline. 
From the time of Brunus, who practiced in 
Padua in 1250, the barbers had done the scari- 
fying and bleeding. After the time of Lan- 
franchi there were others who applied leeches 
and often cauteries, and even the women med- 
dled with surgery and in all operations com- 
peted with the barbers; the lay surgeons held 
themselves rivals to the clergy. Lanfranchi 
inherited from his old master, William, an 
aversion for them all, and often had to con- 
tend with uneducated and incompetent lay- 
men. Clerical surgeons regarded operations 
as beneath their dignity; and Lanfranchi, 
who deplored this condition of affairs, con- 
fessed he had sometimes bled with his own 
hands, but had never operated for ascites, 
hernia, cataract, or stone. 

John Pitard has descended to fame, not as 
a writer but as the founder of the surgical 
schools of St. Come and St. Damien, which 
occupy so eminent a position in the surgical 
annals of France. In 1306 he was surgeon 



to the King of Prance, Philip le Be}, ami the 
sworn surgeon of Chatelet The &lt; 

St Come, in 1311, was little brother- 

hood of I mis, who gradually grew in 

importance as the result of the ODStinati 

struggles sustained— on the one ha 

the faculty of medicine, and on the other 

against the barber surgeons ' le has 

with great patience and clearness shown that 
the importance of this body of men has 
great ted by historians; he has 

1 their various turns of fortune from 
ning to end; I shall have occasion to 
consider them again further on. 

Mondino, sometimes known as Mundinus, 
born in 12 ime a professor in the Uni- 

versity of Bologna, and died in 1327. He 
was the author of a celebrated treat.-- 
anatomy, said to have reached twenty -five 
editions, and which was the first of its kind 
since Galen. This science had been greatly 
neglected: in Salernum, for instance, they 
were for a long time contented with the treat- 
ise of Copho on the anatomy of the hog, and 
most of the anatomical knowledge of the 
age was apparently derived from this source; 
Mondino resurrected the st idy and pursued 
it with interest and enthusiasm, though un- 
der the greatest difficulties. His works for 
more than two centuries, along with the writ- 
ings of Galen and the Arabic authors, served 
for anatomical demonstration, although very 
incomplete — as witness the statement: 

Beneath the veins of the forearm we see 
many muscles and many large and strong 
cords, of which it is not necessary to attempt 
the anatomy on such a corpse (#&gt;., a recent 
one), but on one dried in the sun for three 
years, as I have shown otherwise, in develop- 
ing the number and the anatomy of those of 
the superior and inferior extremity. 

On the other hand he took the opposite 
course to discover and demonstrate the nerves, 
and advised maceration in running water. It 
required almost superhuman boldness to sub- 
stitute demonstrations on the human cadaver 
for those upon swine, yet this was done by 
Mondino; and at the time the prejudice 
against dissection was so general that for 
more than a century after Mondino — who 
died in 1327 — no one dared, at least publicly, 
to emulate his example. It was in the year 
13 15 that he probably dissected the bodies of

two women in Bologna. Anatomical study 
was further complicated at this time by cer- 
tain bulls of Pope Boniface VIII., forbidding 
evisceration or boiling or cooking any part 
of the human body; these deliverances were 
really aimed, not against scientific investiga- 
tion, but at the absurd custom introduced by 
the Crusaders of cutting up and boiling the 
bodies of their relatives who died in infidel 
countries, in order to send them home for 
burial in holy ground; nevertheless, the papal 
injunction certainly operated to discourage 
and prohibit anatomical dissection, since 
nearly 200 years later the University of Tu- 
bingen was obliged to apply to Pope Sixtus 
IV. for permission to authorize dissection. 

Guy de Chauliac, born in Gevaudan about 
1300, was the most famous physician and 
surgeon in Christendom during the Arabic 
Period. He studied at the cathedral college 
of Mende, which at that time was quite cele- 
brated, and was taught medicine at Mont- 
pellier under the best masters of his day. It 
is probable also that he studied in Paris, and 
certain that later, in Bologna, he saw dissec- 
tions made. Dissatisfaction with the writings 
of the ancients and the knowledge which he 
obtained at the schools, stimulated his own 
.powers of observation, and he became in 
every respect an original student and ac- 
quired a degree of erudition far more ex- 
tended than that possessed by any of his 
contemporaries. He practiced in various 
places, longest at Lyons; and finally entered 
the service of Pope Clement VI., at Avignon, 
and probably enjoyed the same honor under 
Innocent V. and Urban V.; when the latter 
was made pope, in 1362, De Chauliac became 
his chaplain, or chapel reader. In 1363 he 
published a work on surgery called "The 
Inventory" upon which his fame chiefly rests, 
though several other volumes emanated from 
his pen. None knew better than he how to 
unite respect for the ancients with justice 
toward contemporaries, and he cited a large 
number of Greek, Arabia*! and Latin authors, 
some of whom are now utterly unknown. 
The sciences, he declared, are 
successive additions; the same 
lay the foundation and perfect the super- 
structure. We are as children carried on the 
neck of a giant; aided by the labors of our 
predecessors we see all that they have seen, 



"created by 
man cannot 



and something beside." In tracing the char- 
acter of a surgeon he recommends that he 
be " learned, expert, ingenious, bold where 
he is sure, timid when in doubt, avoiding bad 
cures and practices, being gracious to the 
sick, generous and compassionate, wise in 
prediction, chaste, sober, pitiful, and merci- 
ful; not covetous nor extortionate, but re- 
ceiving moderate fees according to the cir- 
cumstances of his patients, the character of 
the case, and his own dignity." " Never since 
Hippocrates," says Malgaigne, " has medicine 
learned a language stamped with such nobility 
and in such few words." Although a fol- 
lower of Galen, in anatomy he insisted on 
the necessity of dissection, and proposed to 
make use of the corpses of executed crimi- 
nals for this purpose. The drawings made 
by Henri de Mondeville were known to him; 
he divided abscesses into hot and cold, al- 
though among the latter he included cedema, 
tympanites, dropsy, scirrhus, and other con- 
ditions. In practice he was more timid, yet 
more active, than Lanfranchi, who never cut 
for stone but left that operation to the travel- 
ing surgeons. — De Chauliac described it as 
he had seen it performed; he opened the ab- 
domen for dropsy, did not hesitate to attempt 
the radical cure of hernia, and operated for 
cataract. The plague which raged during 
the fourteenth century and depopulated the 
known world of one-fourth of its inhabitants, 
twice appeared in Avignon while Guy de 
Chauliac was a resident there — and he ac- 
knowledges that nothing but shame pre- 
vented him from fleeing. He remained at 
his post, visited the sick, and was himself 
attacked and left for dead. " In this fright- 
ful position he had sufficient presence of 
mind to follow the peculiarities of his case, 
analyze his own sufferings, and to give a de- 
scription of them worthy of Hippocrates." 
(Renouard.) His work soon became the 
surgical code of Christendom, and was com- 
mented upon and translated into all tongues, 
remaining for a long time a classic, and even 
at this day it preserves much of its interest 
as representing the condition of medical 
science at the close of the Middle Ages; 
moreover, its literary style was much superior 
to that of any of his contemporaries, all of 
whom wrote very barbarous Latin. He died 
about 1370.

THE MEDICAL AGE. 



With the death of De Chauliac terminates 

our interest, not merely in the Arabian phy- 
sicians and those who were intiinat. 
nected with them, but in the so-called Arabic 

riod It may be added, in passing, that 
the followers Of Mahomet, like those of Christ. 
erected by the side of each of their mosques 

school, and often a hospital endowed with 
more or less generosity by caliphs or the 
wealthy, who hoped to purchase redemption 
and eternal happiness by such liberality. 

A certain number of religious orders 01 
communities were established during the 
Middle Ages to give succor to the deserving 
sick, the most widely known being those of 
St Mary, St. Lazarus, St. John of Jerusalem, 
and the Daughters of God. To be sure, 
some, through the endowment of the opulent, 
became rich beyond all reason and departed 
from their primitive purposes, and thus not 
only excited the covetousness of monarchs 
but had even the temerity to resist their 
authority. This compelled, every now and 
again, a suppression of some order or institu- 
tion — partly, perhaps, for laxity of morals, 
and partly because of their turbulence. Of 
this period it may be said that charitable zeal 
for the sick was never more pronounced; 
princes, bishops and popes gave examples of 
devotion by dressing with their own hands 
the ulcers of lepers — and leprosy was in those 
days a frightful disease, having been con- 
tracted by the Crusaders in the Orient, and 
everywhere spread as they returned, being 
moreover favored by the miserable unclean- 
liness which was then so common. Ignor- 
ance, dread and fear rendered this disease 
worse than usual, and it was confounded 
with other maladies less formidable. It has 
been estimated that in the fifteenth century 
Europe harbored no less than 19,000 lepers; 
and that the disease was a great terror is mani- 
fest by the excessive caution taken against its 
spread: its victims were forbidden to enter 
cities, and on the highway were compelled to 
turn aside lest they should taint passers-by 
with their breath; even a healthy person con- 
victed of being touched by a leper was ban- 
ished from society; any infraction of these 
rules was punishable by death. It will thus 
be seen what depth of genuine humanity it 
required to have anything to do with one of 
these outcasts. 



Another institution prevailed widely during 
these days — namely, public baths, which were 
established in oearly every city and incn 
to such an extent that in the fifteenth cen- 
tury the bathers of Paris constituted a pow- 
erful brotherhood — so powerful, in fact, that 
lacque Dcspars, physician to Charles VII. 
and one of the most renowned professors of 
the faculty, for speaking openly against the 
abuse of public baths was obliged to leave 
the capital to avoid persecution. 

Study of the general history of the Arabic 
Period reveals that the Arabs, previously ob- 
scure and uncivilized, emerged rapidly from 
the demi-savage state and took the first 
rank among the polished nations of the world. 
During the earliest portion of this period 
these people were religious vandals and de- 
structive fanatics, but later embraced with 
enthusiasm and persistence a study of the 
humanities, and endeavored to repair their 
early ravages by collecting the debris of the 
literary and scientific monuments of Greece; 
but though they cultivated medicine with zeal 
and success, they added little to the Greek 
treasures. Later, Arabia was overrun by 
hordes from the deserts of Tartary, a people 
yet more barbarous and unknown, who estab- 
lished themselves in all parts of the globe 
then under Saracenic dominion, and by their 
brutal despotism degraded the Arabians to a 
condition approaching that from which they 
had emerged. — This seems to have been ever 
the result of Turkish conquest. 

Meanwhile the Greek nation, which was 
for so many ages at the head of civilization, 
gradually lost its power, virtue, courage, 
glory, and independence, and continued to 
descend until now it exercises no influence 
whatever on the course of events. During 
the course of the Arabic Period only one 
Grecian physician merits mention on account 
of his writings, and in these there was nothing 
new except what he had borrowed without 
credit from the Saracens. 

The Empire of the West — that is, the west- 
ern part of the ancient Roman Empire — after 
subjugation by barbarians from Germany 
and Scandinavia, fell under a cloud whose 
darkness overwhelmed it. Its people, how- 
ever, gradually received new life by com- 
mingling their blood with that of the

invaders. Later they were able to repulse 
the Saracens who poured in upon them from 
Spain; then they turned their armies against 
each other, and wrought mutual havoc and 
ruin for several centuries. Again, roused by 
religious fanaticism, as had been the Moham- 
medans previously, they rushed by thousands 
upon the plains of Asia Minor, Syria, and 
Egypt, which had been for centuries occupied 
by the Arabs; and their adventures and en- 
terprises, and the new and varied scenes 
through which they passed, gave rise among 
the "Francs" to some taste for poetry and 
works of imagination. During the twelfth 
and thirteenth centuries governments became 
more stable, liberal institutions were created, 
the rust of ignorance gradually disappeared, 
and by the end of the Arabic Period there were 
really apparent brilliant streaks of mentality 
in the horizon of the nations of Europe. In 
this progressive movement the study of medi- 
cine shared. In the thirteenth century it was 
worthily represented in Italy, in Paris, and 
became established in Montpellier. Not- 
withstanding, up to this time physicians ap- 
parently only knew how to timidly follow in 
the track of the Arabians, and approached 
little or not at all, in their studies, the purer 
lore of the Greeks. 

The Age of Renovation, according to 
Renouard, is divided into two periods — the 
" Erudite," comprising the fifteenth and six- 
teenth, and the "Reform," embracing the 
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries— and 
in fact I think the latter should embrace the 
present century. In general the literature of 
this age is known as that of the "Renais- 
sance," of the beginning of which a great 
deal has been written. 

At the commencement of the Erudite 
Period, Arabic literature still predominated 
in medicine. ' Rhazes, Haly-Abbas and Avi- 
cenna were universally invoked and ex- 
plained. But a taste for Greek literature 
began to prevail in the universities of Italy, 
and was finally extended to every r part of 
Europe, especially after the taking of Con- 
stantinople by Mahomet II., Emperor of the 
Turks, in 1483. This disaster, which at first 
bade fair to be a mortal blow to Greek litera- 
ture and language, strange to say served only 
to hasten their resurrection in the Occident. 



Constantinople having been given over to 
pillage at this time, most of its learned men 
escaped, carrying with them all manuscripts 
that could be seized; most of these found 
refuge in Italy, and enlightened protectors 
in the all-powerful prince of the house of 
Medici, in Florence, in the popes at Rome, 
and in Alphonso of Arragon, King of Naples 
and Sicily. Everywhere these fugitives spread 
the knowledge of the chef d'auvres of Greek 
literature and art, and in this way a taste for 
books, libraries and sound erudition was dif- 
fused, while the Greek and Latin classics 
were hunted up and published with great 
patience and ardor; thus the works of the 
old writers were edited, translated, com- 
mented upon, and everywhere disseminated 
throughout Europe. 

Among those who devoted themselves to 
the thankless task of editing, and purifying 
from interpolations, the works of the classic 
writers, was Nicholas Leonicenus, born near 
Vincenza in the year 1428, who studied 
medicine at Padua and taught it for more 
than sixty years at Ferrara. He possessed 
great vigor of mind, with purity of manners 
and serenity of soul, and was the first to 
translate directly from Greek into Latin the 
aphorisms of Hippocrates and portions of 
the writings of Galen. He combated in 
every way the infatuation of his contempo- 
raries for the Arabians and their lore, and 
called attention to many of the errors of 
men who, like Pliny the naturalist, had fallen 
for lack of fully understanding the Greek 
authors they compiled. At the ripe age of 
ninety-six he died, regretted by all. 

Thomas Linacre, of Canterbury, a contem- 
porary of Leonicenus, though younger (1461- 
1524), studied first at the University of Ox- 
ford, went to Italy in 1484, and in Florence 
attracted the attention of Lorenzo de Medici, 
who made him the companion of his own 
children, to whom he gave the best possible 
advantages. In due time he returned to 
England, where his talents speedily won him 
high station, and he became physician to 
King Henry VIII., and later to Queen Mary. 
Linacre was the first Englishman, it is said, 
who spoke purely the language of the 
Romans. He translated several books of 
Galen, that are still esteemed; and caused 
the founding of two chairs, one at Oxford,

the other at Cambridge, whose incumbents 
were charged with the duty of explaining the 
works of Hippocrates and Galen. Bat he is 

most entitled to the gratitude of his country- 
men for his influence in founding the Co 
of London. To appreciate properly its im- 
portance ami his merits we must remember 
the obstacles that had to be surmounted; for 
at that time bishops alone had the right to 
accord, in their own dioceses, permission to 
practice medicine, and consequently the heal- 
ing art was abandoned entirely to monks 
and illiterate empirics. It was well that Lin- 
acre had influence at court, else he could 
never have obtained the reform of such over- 
whelming abuses; but he triumphed in spite 
of powerful opposition, and secured the issue 
of letters patent which prohibited the practice 
of medicine by any one who had not received 
a degree in one of the two universities in the 
Kingdom, and been examined by the presi- 
dent of the College of London assisted by 
three others. This was the achievement 
which gave this learned man the title of 
" Restorer of Medicine " in England. 

Leonicenus and Linacre, who were of the 
early Erudite Period, also merit mention not 
merely because of literary talents, but because 
they were the first eminent physicians to em- 
brace the study of Greek classics and to 
propagate the knowledge therein contained. 
Subsequently others followed the same course 
— too many, in fact, to be enumerated; but 
it was easy to follow after such leaders. 
From the time when men began to realize 
the superiority of Greek models over prolix 
Arabian commentaries, they were anxious to 
seek the light at its source, and applied them- 
selves with avidity to the study of the origin- 
als. At this time copies of Greek authors 
were few in number and in a deplorable con- 
dition, owing to neglect. To rediscover them, 
to purify, to eliminate what was not original, 
to rearrange, and finally to multiply by the aid 
of the printing-press, was an extended labor 
requiring great knowledge, rare sagacity, and 
commendable patience. One of the greatest 
publications in medical literature belonging 
to this epoch was a complete edition of the 
Hippocratic writings, translated into Latin 
by Anuce Foes — a poor but learned practi- 
tioner, who lived on the products of his busi- 
ness as pension physician in the city of Metz 



—and issued from l'rankfort-on-the-Main in 

1495. To this master-work 1 

forty years of his life. Another treatise 

belonging to this same time, less important 
perhaps from a medical point r, but 

nevertheless showing great erudition, I 
treatise on the gymnastics of the ancients, by 
Jerome Mcrcurialis, a work said to be not 
less preClOOS to historians than to anti- 
quarians. It was by such intense /eal and 
hard labor that true erudition was restored 
in Europe. 

Following now some of the special branches 
of medical learning and their development, 
let us look first at anatomy and physiology. 
I have already related the salient points of 
the life and labors of Mondino, of whom it is 
said that, about the .year 1315, while profes- 
sor at Bologna, he dissected the bodies of 
two women, and shortly after published an 
epitome of anatomy illustrated with wood- 
cuts Also has been mentioned the prohibi- 
tion of anatomical study pronounced by Pope 
Boniface VIII. in 1300. It was only towards 
the close of the fifteenth and the early years 
of the sixteenth century that this prejudice 
began to abate: the popes who then stood 
at the head of scientific movements withdrew 
their interdictions, and the universities of 
Italy gave public dissections. Achillini, Ben- 
edetti, and Jacques Berenger dissected at 
Bologna, Padua, and Pavia, previous to the 
year 1500; soon after, their example was 
generally followed. 

Jacques Dubois, whose name was Latinized 
into Jacobus Sylvius, was born in 1478, in a 
village near Amiens; he studied in Paris, 
where he worked most industriously at anat- 
omy, which later he was so successful in 
teaching. He was the first to arrange all the 
muscles of the human body, to determine 
their functions, and to give names to those 
of them which had not yet been so desig- 
nated. He discovered the valves of the large 
veins, and was the first to study the blood- 
vessels by means of colored injections. He 
gave tUe same careful attention to pharmacy, 
and in Paris, before a large class of students, 
began lectures on anatomy, physiology, hy- 
giene, pathology, and therapeutics; these he 
continued until the faculty, on account of 
jealousy, interrupted them. He then, in 1529, 
went to Montpellier, but returned two years

Ill 



later to become a member of the faculty, and 
once more lectured with the greatest Mat. 
Later yet he became successor to Vidius in 
the Royal College— a position he retained up 
to his death, in 1555. His medical writings 
were extensive and marked by great accuracy, 
while for anatomy he did a great deal, contrib 
uting much to popularize it. He dissected a 
great number of animals and as many human 
cadavers as he could procure — the number, 
however, being small. Unfortunately he sub- 
ordinated all his own research to the authority 
of Galen, being himself among those anat- 
omists who permitted themselves to be so far 
misled. 

The man of genius and courage, who ac- 
cepted the truth of what his eyes revealed to 
him, and who was the true reformer in anato- 
my, was Andreas Vesalius, born at Brussels 
in 15 14, of a family already illustrious in 
medicine. He studied at the University of 
Louvain, where he early revealed the incli- 
nations of the anatomist, since in his leisure 
moments he was wont to amuse himself in 
dissecting small animals. Near Louvain was 
a place where criminals were executed; and 
Vesalius, having observed the body of one 
from which the soft parts had all been cleaned 
away by ravenous birds, only the bones and 
ligaments remaining, detached the extrem- 
ities separately, and then carried off the 
trunk by night, thus possessing himself of 
his first skeleton. Attracted by the fame of 
Sylvius, he afterwards went to Paris to be- 
come his pupil, but, not content with the les- 
sons of his master, continued to observe for 
himself. On the hill Montfaueon, where exe- 
cutions took place, he disputed with dogs 
and vultures for the remains of criminals, or 
by stealth disinterred bodies from the ceme- 
teries at the greatest personal risk. So great 
was his application that his progress became 
rapid, and at the age of twenty he gave in- 
struction to fellow-students; at twenty-two 
he became professor of anatomy at Padua, 
being appointed by the Senate of Venice; at 
twenty-nine he issued his great work on 
anatomy, which showed a completeness that 
left far in the rear all that had hitherto been 
published on this subject. The following 
year he was called by the Emperor Charles 
V. to the court of Madrid, then the most bril- 
liant in Europe, where he became the first 



physician, and from this time abandoned his 
anatomical labors. 

He was the first who dared to dispute the 
words of Galen and point out his errors — to 
ascertain that the greater part of Galen's de- 
scriptions, having been made from monkeys, 
did not correctly represent human anatomy. 
This audacity raised a crowd of vehement 
opponents, the least reasonable and most 
fanatic being his old master Sylvius; but 
even these onslaughts could not conceal the 
truth. The minds of men generally were 
ripe for the revolution whose signal fire was 
thus lighted, and no sooner did Vesalius ap- 
peal from the decision of Galen to observa- 
tion of nature than a crowd of anatomists 
were ready to follow his method. He died in 
1564. 

One who, at Padua, had been first his pupil, 
then his co-laborer — namely, Columbus, born 
at Cremona in 1490 — succeeded him. Colum- 
bus criticised in some respects the statements 
of his eminent predecessor, which he could 
better do since he is said to have dissected 
fourteen bodies every year, as well as to 
have practiced venesection. He came so 
near to discovering the mystery of the circu- 
lation that it is strange how he could have 
missed it. He even appreciated the systole 
and diastole of the heart and the connection 
thereof with dilatation and contraction of 
the arteries. He knew also that the pulmo- 
nary veins conducted arterial blood, and that 
the pericardium was a shut sac. He even 
appreciated the lesser circulation, since he 
described how the blood left the right side of 
the heart and passed into the lungs, and 
came back through the veins into the left 
ventricle; because of this discovery, and in 
spite of his utter failure to appreciate the 
greater circulation, he has been by some re- 
garded as entitled to the credit which is uni- 
versally given to Harvey. From his position 
as teacher in Jadua, Columbus was called to 
Pisa, and from Pisa to Rome, where he died 

in 1559- 

Another of the great anatomists of this 
period, second only in fame to Vesalius, was 
Eustachius, born about the beginning of the 
sixteenth century. He became physician to 
the Duke of Urbino, and in Rome a city 
physician and professor of anatomy, con- 
tinuing to teach in the latter city until over- 



1 1 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 



taken by hid final sickness. He was a de- 
fender of Ather than an opponent, and 

It to shelter his reputation from the 
attacks of Vesalius. In his praise it must 
. 1 that for his day he . reat anat- 

omist; his chief discoveries were in the 
domain iA comparative anatomy. He brought 
to bear upon his work a knowledge of em- 
bryology which enabled him, for instance, to 

ibe the kidneys and the teeth much 
more ly than would otherwise have 

been possible; he noted also the pathol 
changes in bodies dissected, and is brought 
daily to our minds as we think of the con- 
necting channel between the pharynx and 
the middle ear, to which his name has been 
given. I I :i 1574. 

Fallopius, born in Modena in 1523, was 
professor successively at Ferrara, Pisa, and 
Padua. He cultivated anatomy with the 
greatest ardor, and in consequence his name 
is also linked with that of Vesalius, as are 
those of Herophilus and Krasistratus in the 
history of ancient anatomy. His anatomical 
researches included all parts of the human 
body, and his name has been given to the 
tube through which the ovum enters the 
cavits of the uterus. Death overtook him in 
the year 1562. 

Jerome Fabricius, better known as Fabricius 
ab AquapenJcnte, was born in the town of the 
latter name, near the southern end of the Apen- 
nines, in 1537, received his early education in 
Padua, and studied anatomy under Fallopius, 
whose assistant he also was. After the death 
of the latter he succeeded to the professor- 
ship of anatomy, and later built at his own 
expense a large anatomical theatre in which 
he lectured and demonstrated to students 
from all parts of the world. Toward the 
end of his life he had accumulated a large 
number of specimens, and published exten- 
sively on anatomy, embryology, physiology, 
and surgery. Though often accredited with 
discovering the valves of the veins, he is not 
entitled to that honor, since Erasistratus, Syl- 
vius, Vesalius and others had previously de- 
scribed them, Estiennes had seen them in the 
azygos veins, and Canano in other veins. 
His true claim to glory rests upon embryo- 
logical researches, which he was the first to 
undertake in a comparative way. In u Dc 
Formato Fcetu " he elucidated the develop- 



ment of the embryo and its membranes by a 
long list of observations on lower anim 
many IS probably the first to 

Ibe the uterine decidua. Fabricius tiled 
in 1 6 19. 

This Fabricius must not be confused with 
ilmost-as- renowned Fabricius Hildanna, 

who was bom in Hilden, near Dusseldorf, in 
1560. Fnder the German name of Wilhelm 

Fabry he became widely known as a surgeon, 
and, after traveling through France, settled 

nil llden. but later moved to Cologne, where 
he founded an academy. His first treatise — 
on gangrene and sphacelus— quickly made 
him known, and went through eleven editions. 
From Cologne he went successively to Genf, 
Lausanne, Polen, returned to Cologne, and 
finally, after several other visits, settled in 
Bern, where he died of gout and asthma (in 
1634). His frequent changes of location were 
perhaps less the result of instability than a 
testimony to his reputation, inasmuch as he 
was invited from one place to another. He 
has been with propriety named the " German 
Pare," since he rendered such great service 
to German surgery, and was not only an ex- 
pert therein but likewise a cultivated physi- 
cian and polished humanitarian; in fact he 
was ahead of his time, by many years, in 
these regards, as is shown by his recom- 
mending amputation in cases of gangrene, 
and his writings concerning gunshot wounds. 
He enjoyed a ripe experience also in obstet- 
rics, and even instructed his wife in the ob- 
stetric art and praised her ability most highly. 
His most important contributions to litera- 
ture were in the field of surgery, and these 
passed through numerous editions; while his 
opinions and practice are quoted even to-day. 
During this epoch many modifications were 
introduced and improvements made in the 
teaching of medicine. Permanent amphi- 
theatres were established for dissection, and 
chairs of anatomy created, their incumbents 
being paid out of the public treasury. The 
popes appear to have taken the initiative in 
this respect, which accounts for the great 
number of subjects with which Eustachius 
was supplied, as compared with Vesalius, who 
obtained only two or three in a year. Up 
to this time the razor had been the sole in- 
strument of dissection, but was now replaced 
by the scalpel, which remains in use to-day. 



THE MEDICAL AGE.

By the labors of the few men mentioned, 
anatomy acquired a degree of perfection 
which it had never attained under the Greeks. 
Skillful artists put their labors upon paper, 
and plates and descriptions made from an- 
atomical preparations represented the various 
parts of the human body with more fidelity 
than had been supposed possible. Nerves, 
tendons and ligaments were no longer con- 
fused, but traced so far as possible from 
origin to ramifications. Ancient errors gen- 
erally were corrected. It was proven there 
were no bony structures in the tissue of the 
heart, that the partition between its cavities 
was not porous; and attentive examination 
of its valves led to the discovery of the lesser 
circulation by Columbus. — Michael Servetus, 
whom John Calvin burned at the stake, was 
perhaps the first to note this phenomenon. 
He saw that the blood could not penetrate 
directly from the right into the left cavity of 
the heart, but that it was necessary for the 
whole fluid to pass through the lungs where 
it became impregnated with the vital spirit 
of the atmosphere, and reached afterward the 
left auricle; the position of the valves in the 
pulmonary arteries and veins clearly con- 
firmed his conjecture. Moreover, the size 
of the pulmonary arteries was enormous, and 
disproportionate to the quantity of blood 
necessary for the nutrition of the lungs, which 
seemed to prove that this was not, as had 
been believed, the sole purpose of those ves- 
sels. It was about this time that Fabncius 
ab Aquapendente pointed out valves in veins 
in various parts of the body, and that Colum- 
bus and Andreas Cesalpinus explained more 
fully the mechanism of the lesser circulation; 
in fact, the former so closely approached an 
appreciation of the purpose of the vascular 
system that some have thought he really 
knew it, but the passages in his writings 
thought to sustain this opinion are not at all 
conclusive. He seems to have confused the 
action of the heart during sleep with that 
during the waking hours; and although he 
realized the blood could not flow backward 
through the arteries, that the vena cava was 
the only vessel which permitted the entrance 
of blood into the heart, and though he spoke 
of anastomosis between arteries and veins 
and remarked that if a band be applied 
around a limb the veins swell below the liga- 



ture, he contented himself with comparing 
the motion of the blood with the flux and 
reflux of Euripus, as Aristotle had done. It 
is even thus that he tortured his mind in 
trying to reconcile two irreconcilable theories 
— i.e., the opinion of the ancients on the 
motion of the blood, and recent discoveries 
in the anatomy of the vascular system.

THE ABUSE OF THE REPRINT. 

It is a courteous and commendable custom 
for an author who has written an article of 
real value to send reprints thereof to libraries 
for reference, to his friends for preservation, 
and to those pursuing the same line of inves- 
tigation, who might not otherwise become so 
soon acquainted with his researches. When, 
however, the reprint is used merely to ad- 
vertise the fact that the writer is peculiarly 
skillful in a certain specialty, it is less com- 
mendable; and when it is used to advertise 
Messrs. Enterprise &amp; Paywell's Panacea, or 
some similar substance, it becomes anything 
but commendable. These thoughts are sug- 
gested by the receipt of a pamphlet, reprinted 
from a journal published in a neighboring 

city, and bearing the title " Functional ," 

by X. Y. Z., M.D., Professor of in the 

, etc.; which publication, although osten- 



sibly coming to us from the author, is quite 
evidently circulated as an advertisement by, 
and at the expense of, the firm whose "trade- 
mark " product is therein recommended (no 
doubt honestly) as a sovereign remedy for 
the affection in question. Apart from all 
questions of propriety, men who permit their 
names thus to be misused are very short- 
sighted. Their advice, however unjustly, 
comes to be looked upon with suspicion, as 
not wholly scientific and disinterested; and 
their reputation becomes upon a par with that 
of the " advance agents" of theatrical noto- 
rieties — an honorable reputation when one 
does not pretend to be other than an advance 
agent. The advertising reprint and the read- 
ing notice are twin growths of the same poi- 
sonous root, and should be utterly condemned 
by thinking, self-respecting physicians. —

Editorial. 



ANGLE-WORM OIL. 

The Medical Standard recently revamped 
this ancient remedy, which was once official 
in the British Pharmacopoeia — even up to the 
middle of the last century — under the name 
of "Aqua el Spirit us Lumbricorum Magistra- 
tus," and which is said to be occasionally 
called for even now in the pharmacies of 
northwest and southwest Britain. The Stand- 
ard copies the following directions for its prep- 
aration: 

Take of Earth-worms well cleansed, three 
pounds; Snails with shells on their backs, 
cleansed, two Gallons; beat them in a Morter, 
and put them into a convenient Vessel, add- 
ing stinking Nettles, Boots and all, six hand- 
fuls, wild Angelica four handfuls, Brank- 
L'rsine seven handfuls, Agrimony, Bettony, of 
each three handfuls, Rue one handful, common 
Wormwood two handfuls, Rosemary flower 
six ounces, Dock- roots ten ounces, Clove ber- 
ries and root of sorrel five ounces, Turmerick, 
the inner part of Bar- berries, of each four 
ounces, Fenugreek seed two ounces, Cloves 
powdered three ounces, Harts horn, Ivory, in 
gross powder, of each four ounces, saffron 
three drams, small spirit of wine four Gallons 
and an half; after twenty-four hours infusion, 
distill them in an Alembick. Let the four first 
pounds be reserved for Spirit, the last for 
water. 

This is very far, however, from being 
"Angleworm Oil." The nineteenth-century 
individual who seeks the "ile" will not be 
satisfied with the comparatively pleasant 
preparation of an ancient British pharma- 
copoeia — it is not loud enough; it does not 
suggest "smelling to heaven;" moreover, it 



is too expensive and does not appeal to the 

finny tribes whi&lt; h populate our w;i: 

When the lad with the hole in his hat, 
through which his hair waves as a plume; 
clad in hickory shirt, one "gallus," and trou- 
sers rolled to knees; with &gt;e in vol- 
uminous rags on one foot, and a stone-bruise 
on the heel of its companion; sa 
stockings, coat, and vest; duly armed with a 
"stick and a string" — asks for "angle-worm 
oil," he wants the simon-pure preparation — 
solar-distilled, — which there is but one mode 
of preparing: 

Take a green glass bottle of the capacity 
of one quart — preferably a flat whiskey-flask 
of the cheapest kind, with the American eagle 
blown in its side — and fill with angle-worms 
freshly dug from the muck-heap; washing 
or cleansing ruins the combination. Now 
place the flask, duly corked with a corn cob 
wrapped in any old piece of cloth, on the top 
rail of a fence, where the solar rays will reach 
it from early dawn to sunset; and leave it' 
there. In the course of a fortnight or three 
weeks the " beasts " will have disappeared, and 
in their place will be found a smaller volume 
(about one-fourth) of an oleaginous com- 
pound of most hideous and villainous odor — 
it is unnecessary to sample the effluvia more 
than once ! This is the only pure and "ginu- 
ine angle-worm oil," a sure lure for mullet, 
suckers, and bass, but best strengthened by 
the addition of tincture of asafcetida or oil 
of anise or of cumin. 

Try it, ye piscatorially inclined sons of 
.-Esculapius. — One experience will be suffi- 
ciently convincing! "The Complete Angler" 
will never again rouse your enthusiasm for 
bait-fishing, even if you are not inclined to 
classically anathematize the sport with a 
"Walton be — hanged !" 



TREATMENT OF TAPEWORM. 

In a recent communication to The Lancet 
(London), Doctor Leslie Ogilvie attributes 
the frequent failures to remove taeniae to lack 
of attention to usual details in the adminis- 
tration of remedies. When the purgative 
follows soon after the anthelmintic, the worm 
is carried away all but the head; and in such 
cases it is useless to repeat the drug, as is 
frequently done, in a short time, since the 



;

115 



parasite now offers but scanty absorbing sur- 
face, and the chief effect is to poison the 
patient. Doctor Ogilvie does not consider 
castor oil a suitable purgative to give before 
the administration of the anthelmintic, as 
there is in all probability a considerable coat- 
ing of mucus about the taenia which the oil 
does not remove; here Sulphate of Magnesia 
with tincture of Jalap is most efficacious. 

He commands his patients to eat less than 
usual for a few days before treatment, and 
twenty-four hours before to restrict them- 
selves to a milk diet with possibly a little 
stimulant. At bedtime a draught of Sulphate 
of Magnesia and tincture of Jalap is given, 
which is repeated at seven the next morning 
if the first dose is not operative. An hour 
later a drachm of fluid extract of Male Fern 
is administered, and in another hour a second 
dose. At eleven o'clock a dose of Castor Oil 
is administered — even if the worm has been 
passed previously it is well to give this to 
remove any poison which may be left. He 
visits his patients soon after the second dose 
of Male Fern has been given and inspects 
the stools, each one of which should have 
been preserved in a separate vessel. In 
searching for the head he finds it very desir- 
able to employ a dilute solution of perman- 
ganate of potash as a disinfectant and to 
separate the taenia from the faeces. 



A VALUABLE SURGICAL AID. 

In these days, when perfect asepsis is 
deemed a sine qua non to all surgical work, 
any aid thereto, or anything that will sim- 
plify the labor entailed, is of general interest 
to the medical profession. 

In reviewing a recent publication — "The 
Manual of Modern Surgery," by John Chal- 
mers Da Costa — it was observed especial 
emphasis was placed upon the tenets and 
Drecautions of antiseptic surgery, and that 
|:he author gave unqualified praise to the 
ethereal antiseptic soap devised by Johnston, 
pf the Jefferson Medical College Hospital, 
Philadelphia. His experience tallies so closely 
|vith our own, we venture to repeat his rec- 
ommendation that "there is nothing equal to 
t" in preparing the hands and arms of the 
&gt;perator, or the integument of the patient to 
&gt;e operated upon for the knife; and that it 



is equally effective for cleansing or preparing 
sponges for any surgical procedure, especially 
for, or after, use in the abdomen, rectum, or 
vagina. Da Costa further adds, it is invalu- 
able in the treatment of eczema — that bete 
noir of all practitioners,— and for cleansing 
deep cutaneous ulcers prior to the applica- 
tion of plasters and medicaments. 

The fact the preparation is a fluid, is of in- 
estimable advantage — it is always ready for 
use, equally effective with hot or cold water, 
and the one detergent that effectually destroys 
not only all germs with which it comes in 
contact, but those odors which linger about 
the hands after post-mortems and certain 
other examinations. — If this latter were its 
sole property, it would be sufficient to recom- 
mend it to general use by surgeons and phy- 
sicians alike. But it also possesses another 
great advantage in permitting combination 
with bichloride in almost any proportion — 
something that is practically impossible with 
other detergents of this class; heretofore any 
form of mercurialized soap has been a fail- 
ure. 

Thus ethereal antiseptic soap commends 
itself for many medical and surgical pur- 
poses. As a parasiticide it is as effective as 
in the destruction of bacteria, and speedily 
removes pediculi; is a specific for scabies if 
properly applied, and of great assistance in 
the management of tinea, favus, and other 
skin diseases of this class. The editor of 
The Medical Age can personally testify to 
its power as a remover of dandruff. 

Still again: it is one of the few articles of 
the last decade of the nineteenth century 
that, bearing the name of its author, is not 
patented or trademarked. 



NUCLEIN-A CORRECTION. 

By one of those accidents that sometimes 
occur to the busy editor, an editorial upon 
Nuclein in the last issue of The Medical 
Age contains a statement diametrically op- 
posed to that which was intended. We were 
made to say an alkaline Nuclein should be 
regarded with suspicion, when it was intended 
to have said acid Nuclein — for the reason that 
by the addition of acid to this product the 
Nuclein is precipitated in the form of a thick 
whitish-yellow precipitate.

may justly claim as a solution of Nuclei n a

It is essential, too, that the source of Xu- 
clein be mentioned, since it is well known 
that this product may be obtained from j

substance, however, yielding by far the best 
quality. 



EDITORIAL NOTES. 



COD-LIVER OIL ALKALOIDS. 

An Associated Press dispatch from Vic- 
toria, British Columbia, under date of Feb- 
ruary 19th, says: 

William Good's family breakfasted on cod- 
fish from which the liver had not been re- 
moved. Three of the sufferers were brought 
very close to death, but all are now on the 
road to recovery. This is the first case of 
cod liver oil poisoning on record here. 

If the alkaloids arising from putrefaction 
in cod-liver can cause the serious illness of 
a family, what must be the value of these 
same alkaloids and ptomaines when placed 
in solution and advertised as a succedaneum 
for true cod-liver oil ? 

This is not the first case, however, of poi- 
soning of this character, since serious results 
have accrued on various occasions through 
the ingestion of cod-liver oil — expressed, as 
perhaps a majority of the cod-liver oils in 
market are, from putrid and semi-putrid 
livers. 

Cod-liver oil as a medicament depends upon 
the fact that it is the most easily digestible 
form of fat, and it may readily be seen from 
the foregoing that it is most essential in se- 
lecting such a product that it be prepared 
from absolutely fresh livers. 



fatal Poisoning b\ Ouassia.— 

D : Venn, of Chicago, reports to Pro- 
fessor i 1. C. Wood I fatality in a &lt; hild 
as the result of the administration, per rec- 
tum, for the relief of "pin worms," of an in- 
fusion of Ouassia, two ounces to the pint. 
This is the first case of the kind on re 
though, as Doctor Wood remarks, the experi- 
ments of Hoppe show that the active princi- 
ple of Quassia "is a poison to frogs, especially 
affecting the nerve-trunks and the muscles; 
fifteen milligrammes of this principle causes 
in man violent frontal headache, vertigo, ex* 
cessive nervous restlessness with pronounced 
evidence of toxic gastro-enteritis, such as 
burning pains, vomiting, and diarrhoea." 

In Doctor Venn's case nearly a pint of the 
infusion was employed, and ten minutes later 
the child became livid, its lips cyanosed, and 
the skin of a waxy hue; when seen, respiration 
was shallow and labored, muscles entirely re- 
laxed, and pulse imperceptible. It was first 
thought the intestine had been perforated 
by the syringe-nozzle, but such was not the 
case. 

Artificial Fecundation.— 

John Hunter was the first to perform this 
operation. Consulted by a person who de- 
sired family, but whose urethra opened intc 
the perineum, he recommended the use of a 
syringe, previously warmed, to inject, posi 
coitum, the semen into the vagina, during 
the orgasm. Long before, however, Aver- 
roes reported a woman " that conceived in a i 
bath, by attracting the sperm of a man ad- 
mitted to bathe near her" — which may be 
taken for what it is worth, though it was ad- 
mitted by Mohammedan expounders of juris- 
prudence as a precedent. J. Marion Simj 
performed the operation fifty-seven times, 
taking up the semen from the vagina imme- 
diately after coitus and injecting it into the 
uterus; and though some success attended 
his efforts, none of those thus rendered enceinU 
ever proceeded to full term, hence the ulti- 
mate aim was not accomplished; moreover 
the successes were not of a character to en- 
courage further experimentation.

Hypodermatic Catharsis.— 

Recently, in The Medical News, Doctor 
Fincke gave the results of personal experi- 
ence and experiments with Magnesium Sul- 
phate employed hypodermatically as a pur- 
gative. Twenty-five cases were selected and 
fifty injections of from one to six grains 
made. 

In order to compare the hypodermatic 
method fairly with ingestion by the stomach, 
eleven cases were selected that had proved 
refractory to subcutaneous medication. As a 
result, eighty-two per cent, of the cases 
treated hypodermatically proved utter fail- 
ures, while only twenty-seven per cent, of 
failures occurred when the drug was given 
by the mouth. 

This tallies with the experiments made by 
the editor of this journal and others, and 
heretofore reported in The Medical Age. 
It is evident that the claimed purgative prop- 
erty of Magnesium Sulphate when exhibited 
subcutaneously is mythical. 

Precautions in the Use of Pessaries.— 

Neugerbaner has collected 282 cases in 
which pessaries have been the cause of more 
Dr less grave lesions of the genital organs, 
[t is therefore insisted that when a pessary is 
used great care be taken as to its form, size, 
l;he substance from which it is made, and 
hat the patient be subsequently under con- 
trol of the physician. Neugerbaner prefers 
globular or ovoid pessaries, and lays stress 
l&gt;n the point that the patient should herself 
exactly understand how to withdraw the pes- 
ary at night and insert it in the morning, 
md, in case it is employed for retro-displace- 
nents, to withdraw it as soon as it causes the 
lightest pain — not being compelled by ignor- 
nce to await the aid of a physician. 

•Tiysiology and the Fair Sex.— 

The effect of physiological knowledge on a 
soman's mind is not always to be calculated, 
^he Lancet (London) is authority for the fol- 
ding letter, received by one of the examin- 
es of the College of Physicians, from a 
imale aspirant for a medical diploma, who 
ad been plucked but permitted a second 
go:" 



Sir: — Don't you dare refuse me again in physi- 
ology, when you know I know all about physiology. 
I very likely know more than you do. I shall 

write to Mr. , if you do, about it. Very soon 

doctors will be drawn only from we pure, noble- 
minded women, and you vile, drunken, filthy men 
expelled forever. 

"Travailleurs de la nort."— 

This is the title of a semi-medico-legal 
work by Doctor P. Meguin, recently published 
in Paris, and descriptive of the various kinds 
of life which act as scavengers of dead 
bodies. It aims to* show that these scavengers 
make their appearance at definite points of 
time, so that a knowledge of the order and 
class, and of their coming, will enable an 
investigator to determine the length of time 
that has elapsed since death, provided it does 
not exceed three years. 

Strychnia in Uterine Haemorrhage. — 

Recently very extensive claims have been 
made for Strychnine as a specific against all 
forms of uterine haemorrhage. In gestation 
where there has been a previous history of 
flooding, it is advised to administer in one-six- 
tieth-grain doses three times daily for a period 
of from four to six weeks before expected 
labor. It is also declared to be of value 
where previous parturitions have been tardy 
owing to irregular and feeble uterine con- 
tractions. 

The "Liver Pad" Redivivus.— 

Strange to say, the " liver pad" craze which 
ran riot some years ago, and in fact wore it- 
self out, has taken a new lease, and already 
the old advertisement of " cure-all" effects 
are to be seen in the magazines. 

Citric Acid in Pertussis. — 

Moncorvo declares Citric Acid exercises a 
decided action upon whooping-cough and 
may be used with success as a prophylactic 
either in the form of strong lemonade or as 
the juice of lemons. 

Protective Inoculation in India.— 

The protective-inoculation methods for the 
prevention of cholera adopted in India, ac- 
cording to the Medical Press and Circular, 
"have not proved a signal success."

Items and News, 



*• Pithecanthropus." — 

\: B recent meeting ot the Tar- - 

ol Anthropology, M. Manouvriet 
lint of the discovery by M I 

Dubois, - in the Dutch Army at 

cranium and femur with 
rs partly pithecoid, partly anthropoid. 

The remains were found in the lower qua- 
ternary strata in Sumatra, and M. Dubois 

llblished a very complete monograph 
upon them. The cranium of the " pithe- 
canthropus" is described as being interme- 
diate in character between the anthropoid 

and the aboriginal Australian. It ex- 
hibits an ration of the Neanderthal 
skull, with its enormous superciliary emi- 
nences. 'Flit cranial capacity is much greater 
than that ot" the largest gorilla, but it is less 
than in primitive man and does not exceed 
that of advanced imbecility. A molar tooth 
that was found near the skull more resembles 
in its great size that of a monkey than of a 
man. The position of the occipital foramen 
shows that this was seated upon the verte- 
bral column more directly than in any an- 
thropoid ape. It most approximates to the 
gibbon, but the differences between the 
human skull and that of the gibbon are 
greater than between this specimen and that 
of man. The femur, which was the only 
other part of the skeleton found (although, 
as the site of this bone was at some distance 
from the cranium, it may not belong to the 
same individual), shows that the pithecan- 
thropus could walk erect. The femur, in- 
deed, approximated more to the human type 
than the cranium. In the course of the dis- 
cussion M. Duval remarked that the com- 
munication was perhaps the most important 
that had ever been made to the society, and 
thought the Netherlands Government should 
be asked to have casts made for presentation 
to the museum. He considered that the 
more markedly human type of the femur than 
of the cranium suggested that the pithecan- 
thropus had learned to walk in human fashion 
before it had developed human intelligence. 
— The Lancet (London). 

♦'American Orthographical Errors." — 

Our Australian confreres are apparently 
just as decidedly opposed to certain Ameri- 
can methods of spelling English words as we 
are in this part of the world. Here is an ex- 
tract from a review on an American medical 
work, published in " Filadelphia": 

" Everywhere are noticeable American 
orthographical errors quite inexcusable: e.g..

"chemic" it is difficult to know how to 
strain a display of hilarity within the bounds 
of propriety. — Medical Press and Circular. 

The " Danse du Ventre" in Therapy. — 

Physicians who visited " Midway " hardl) 
dreamed that the stomach dance would pla) 
a part in therapy. The Lyon M/dical recently 
i^ave an account of a young actress who sul 
fered from obstipation, supposed to be due 
to uterine displacement. The girl securec 
an engagement to perform the ''danse du ven- 
tre" in the rural districts, and from the time 
of the first representation found her bowel; 
perfectly free; subsequent performance ol 
this dance four times daily is said to have 
kept them in good order. A New York jour 
nal, in commenting thereupon, naturally asb 
whether the girl performed this dance it 
public without previous practice, or whethei 
mere rehearsal lacked the therapeutic actior 
of a public performance ? — Medical Standard 

The Corset in France.— 

A petition has been presented to the Frencr 
Chamber of Deputies against wearing the 
corset as injurious to the health of the fe 
male part of the population. The Chambei 
solemnly received the petition, and passed \' 
in committee. Meantime a Paris journals 
has been gathering the opinions of notable 
women. A great many of them denounce 
the corset, declaring it to be unhealthy anc 
ungraceful; they say it turns the figures intc 
one commonplace mould, spoiling prett) 
ones and doing nothing to improve the ugl) 
ones; yet most of the fair ones interviewed 
who expressed themselves in this fashion 
wore the objectionable garment. — Medico- 
Record. 

Patent and Proprietary Hedicines.— 

The Therapeutic Gazette justly declares the 
majority of these have no real merit. " Mos 
of them represent absolutely nothing tha 
was not previously known to science; the) 
are nuisances; they do not contribute to gen

eral intellectual progress; they discourage 
scientific investigation. . . . The only 
explanation that can be given of this lament- 
able state of affairs lies in the laxity and 
ambiguity of the present patent laws, and 
the almost puerile knowledge which they 
manifest regarding the history of chemistry 
in its broadest sense. A medicinal prepara- 
tion need not represent anything further than 
a new name." 

A Novelty in Poisoning.— 

The Medico-Legal Society of Paris has re- 
ceived a communication respecting the death 
of a child five months old. No symptoms of 
disease were found, but, upon post mortem 
examination, it was discovered that the stom- 
ach and intestinal canal contained numerous 
pieces of sponge. It was concluded that the 
child's mother had utilized for its destruction 
the. method sometimes used with dogs, of 
giving them pieces of sponge soaked in fat 
and pressed tight, so that, as the fat was re- 
moved by digestion, the sponge might expand 
and block the intestinal canal. — Medical Press. 

A Forgotten Honor Recalled.— 

The trephine was first used in the United 
States in the middle of the seventeenth cen- 
tury, by Doctor John Clarke, the first physi- 
cian of Boston, a graduate, " cum laude" of 
the Royal College of Physicians. From him 
directly descended seven doctors, S. John 
Clarke, the last, dying childless in 1807. 
Samuel Clarke, brother of the second Doctor 
John Clarke, also had medical descendants, 
one of whom, the late Doctor E. H. Clarke, 
vvas a leading clinician of New England. — 
Medical Standard. 

-rench Women and Medical Study.— 

According to Le Progres Medical, the 
nedical profession does not have much at- 
raction for French women. Of 165 female 
students registered in the Paris Medical 
"acuity at the beginning of the present 
icademic year, only sixteen were French. 
)n the other hand, of a total of 164 female 
tudents in the Faculty of Letters, 141 were 
r rench. There were seven French female 
-tudents in the Faculty of Science, and three 
1 that of the Law. — Medical Times. 

antitoxin.— 

Doctors should be careful about buying 
reparations labeled "Antitoxin." Thetemp- 
ition to manufacturing chemists is of course 
reat, to offer this promising remedy for sale, 
ut inasmuch as the process of manufacture 



requires several months, there is as yet no 
reliable antitoxin of American make. Thus 
far only the German or French preparation 
can be considered genuine or effective. — At- 
lanta Medhal and Surgical Journal. 

Porous Glass for Windows. — 

The latest hygienic craze in Paris is the 
use of porous glass for windows. It is de- 
clared to possess all the advantages of the 
ordinary window-framing, and, while light is 
as freely admitted as through the medium of 
common glass, the "porous" further admits 
air too, the minute holes being too fine to 
permit of any draught, while they provide a 
healthy continuous ventilation through the 
apartment. — The Hospital. 

Scholarships and London Medical Schools.— 

At the recent examinations for honors at 
the University of London the scholarships 
and gold medals were pretty evenly won by 
students of the principal London hospital 
schools. Guy's and St. Thomas's were first 
in "Medicine," St. Bartholomew's and St. 
Thomas's first in "Obstetric Medicine," and 
St. Mary's and University College first in 
"Forensic Medicine." — Medical Press and 
Circular. 

Suggestive ! — 

He came into my office wearing an expres- 
sion equally venereal and lugubrious. He 
was one of " the boys." "Aha!" exclaimed 
I, "dropped your nickel in the wrong slot?" 
"'Twasn't a nickel," he said, with a sigh, and 
I proceeded immediately to fix up his dope. — 
Doctor Cooper, in Medical Gleaner. 

A Wise Reform!— 

The Italian Government has decided to 
abolish twenty-three universities by convert- 
ing them into preparatory schools. In place 
of these it will create in four or five of the 
larger cities thoroughly modern and well ap- 
pointed State universities. — Lancet- Clinic. 

Science vs. Fact.— 

Scientists say that at about 3 o'clock a.m. 
the human body is at its lowest ebb of 
strength; yet who has not heard of the baby 
that is able to raise the whole house at that 
hour? — New York Medical Times.

Life and Letters of Hahnemann. By Thomas L. 
Bradford. Cloth; bvo; pp. 513. Price, $2.50. 

This is a very complete history of the great 
apostle of homoeopathy, and is of interest not 
only to homoeopaths but to all medical men, 



in that it deals with a portion of medical his- 
tory which is too little understood. What- 
ever may be the opinion regarding homoe- 
opathy, the fact remains that Hahnemann 
was a man of great ability and had already 
earned a reputation before he founded his 
new system of medicine. Of particular in- 
terest to the general practitioner are the 
chapters devoted to Hahnemann's posology. 
We are very much pleased to have the oppor- 
tunity to peruse this work — not because of 
any leaning toward simrfia, but because of 
the historical facts therein embodied. 



Relations of the Eye to General Diseases. By 
Max Knies, M.D. Cloth; 8vo; pp. 470. Price, 
$4.75. Wm. Wood &amp; Company, New York. 

This is an English translation of Professor 
Knies's work, edited by Henry D. Noses, 
A.M., M.D. It tells in a clear and concise 
manner how diseases of the eye often possess 
important significance in relation to the diag- 
nosis and correct understanding of diseases 
of other organs. Throughout the book the 
alliances between the eye and the rest of the 
body are so admirably traced that it will be 
hard to decide upon whom the larger debt 
of obligation to the painstaking author will 
rest — whether upon the general physician or 
upon the ophthalmologist. Indeed, the book 
is really a cross-index between the general 
field of medicine and ophthalmology. 



The Birds of Ontario. By Thomas Mcllwraith. 
Cloth; 8vo; pp. 426. Price, $2.00. William 
Briggs, Toronto. 

This elegant volume should be in the hands 
of all who are interested in the natural his- 
tory of North America or are lovers of birds, 
for it is by all odds the most able comp la- 
tion extant of the ornithology of Canada. 
Its value is materially enhanced by the num- 
ber of engravings which adorn it, and whi h 
are examples of the best efforts of the printer's 
art. 

The introductory chapter, which deals with 
bird life, collecting and preserving of speci- 
mens, etc., is alone worth the price of the 
volume.

Therapeutic Brevities, 



Gonorrhoea. — If gonorrhoea is in the acute 
stage, M Routier advises simple antiphlogis- 
tic treatment, but as soon as the malady has 
become subacute he commences by washing 
out by a continual stream not only the ante- 
rior but also the posterior portion of the 
urethra. To practice these injections a res- 
ervoir placed at a height of five feet above 
the penis of the patient, with a capacity of 
two quarts, is employed, filled with solution 
of Permanganate of Potash, i to 2000. An 
india-rubber tube two yards in length, with a 
small glass cannula at the end, is attached to 
the reservoir. The patient first urinates in 
order to expel any mucus accumulated in 
the canal; then inserts the cannula into the 
urethra, when the liquid penetrates up to the 
neck of the bladder and then flows back, 
thus washing out the anterior portion of the 
canal. This done, the patient is made to 
close the meatus tightly about the cannula, 
when the liquid, failing of other exit, soon 
penetrates to the bladder. The current is 
totally arrested when is felt a desire to uri- 
nate. The operation can be recommended 
once or twice at each stance, and renewed 
the following days. At the end of a week a 
cure is generally effected. In order to make 
sure that the patient is really cured, it is rec- 
ommended he drink a quart of beer, that 
beverage being infallible to reproduce the 
"running" when the disease is not wholly 
arrested. — Medical Press and Circular. 



quarter of a century ago, known the value of 
this remedy, he would have been gratified by 
its influence in the treatment of what he 
termed "irritable uterus."— Doctor H. R. 
Holmes, in Journal of the American Medical 
Association. 



Viburnum Prunifohum. — Like the cinchona 
tree, the bark is the part which yields the 
medicinal virtues. It has a specific action on 
the female reproductive organs, and is anti- 
menorrhagic and anti-metronhagic. Infu- 
sions and decoctions may be used, but in these 
days of refined chemistry the fluid extract re- 
quires no further recommendation than its 
simple mention; compressed pills and tablets 
of the solid extract have also attracted my 
notice. Liquor Sedans, containing not only 
the Black Haw, but golden-seal and Jamaica 
dogwood combined with aromatics, is an ex- 
cellent preparation, to which in certain cases 
ergot may be profitably added. 

I prescribe Black Haw to prevent abor- 
tion; to control menorrhagia and metror- 
rhagia from uterine fibroid or endometrial 
fungosities; as a sedative in ovarian conges- 
tion and its ordinary consequences, etc., and, 
too, in almost all kinds of pelvic irritation, 
congestion, and inflammation. May I just 
here inject the remark that had Hodge, a 



A Case of Poisoning with Nutmegs. — Mr. 
T. G. Simpson, in The Lancet (London), re- 
lates that in December his assistant was called 
to see a strong, healthy woman, twenty-six 
years old, who was found lying on the bed in 
a drowsy condition and very delirious. There 
were fairly lucid intervals, when she com- 
plained of a sensation of great tightness 
across the chest and of vertigo and faintness 
when attempting to rise; she also vomited 
several times. Her pulse was seventy- five, 
rather feeble; heart's action feeble; pupils 
normal. It was ascertained she had taken 
two nutmegs crushed, in a small quantity of 
gin, as an emmenagogue. She was ordered 
to remain in bed, and to take strong coffee 
with a dessertspoonful of brandy every half- 
hour; also was prescribed a mixture of potas- 
sium bromide, ammonium carbonate, sodium 
bicarbonate, spirit of cajeput, and chloroform- 
water. Mr. Simpson saw the patient a few 
hours later and found her condition improved, 
but still showing the same symptoms. He 
continued the treatment, and the next day 
she was very much better, although weak and 
with a little vertigo; the following day she 
was able to get up. 



Arseniate of Soda in Leukcemia. — No one 
denies the efficacy of arsenic in leukaemia 
and lymphadenia. A one per-cent. solution 
©f the Arseniate of Soda hypodermatically is 
an efficient substitute — Fowler's solution is 
too irritating for subdermic use. Injected 
with aseptic precautions the procedure is 
painless, while it leaves no nodules. To ob- 
tain good results one should not fear to em- 
ploy large-sized doses. Begin by injecting 
five drops of the one-per-cent. solution, and 
rapidly carry the dose up to fifty or sixty 
drops per injection. Continue these until 
signs of intolerance appear — dryness of the 
throat, sensation of constriction of the 
pharynx, injection of the ocular conjunctiva, 
slight oedema of the eyelids, rhinitis, cutane- 
ous eruptions, formication, headache, and a 
tendency to diarrhoea. As many as fifty in- 
jections have been given to the same patient. 
Under their influence the spleen and enlarged 
glands diminish considerably in volume, the 
relations of the red and white blood cor- 
puscles approach the normal, and the general 
condition is greatly improved. — Professor 
Rummo, in La Semaine Me' die ale.

f Xail. — Ingrowing nail, or 
income, as the French call it, is, as is 
well known, a very painful affection, and, 
unfortunately, the operation necessary for 
its cure is often dreaded by the patients, 
although local and general anaesthetics are 
employed to render the avulsion as painless 
as possible. A very simple method has been 
frequently employed by a confrere with con- 
stant success. It consists in painting the 
offending portion of the nail with a warmed 
forty-per-cent. solution of Caustic Potash. In 
a few seconds the upper horny layer is ren- 
dered so soft that it can be easily removed 
by a piece of broken glass used as a scraper. 
The application of the solution and the scrap- 
ing is continued until nothing but an exceed- 
ingly thin portion of the nail remains, which 
can be easily removed by a small scissors. 
The patient can now be considered cured, 
without having lost a drop of blood nor felt 
any pain. — Paris Correspondence Medical Press 
and Circular. 



Belladonna in Skin Diseases. — Eliza Dun- 
bar, M.D., ( Woman s Medical Jourtuil) speaks 
in high terms of the benefit she has derived 
from the internal administration of Bella- 
donna in all itching skin diseases. She has 
employed it in pruritus and eczema. Daily 
doses of one drachm are usually enough. It 
may be combined with tr. ferri, and in this 
form is very helpful in pruritus pudendi. In 
some old and obstinate cases, not only was the 
itching relieved, but the cases did well and 
improved under the administration of the 



drug. Persons vary in their susceptibility to 
'rug, and this must be kept in mind.

Croup. — The medical treatment of croup 
that will give the best chance of recovery is: 
A warm room, the air of which is saturated 
with moisture; an emetic of Turpeth mineral, 
to be repeated whenever the respiration be 
comes embarrassed; if the bowels are consti 
pated, a sufficient amount of calomel to move 
them thoroughly; ice to the throat, either in 
a rubber bag or bladder; if thirst exists, 
pellets of ice internally; quinine to decided 
cinchonism, which is to be maintained; a 
sufficient amount of chloral hydrate to allay 
spasms of the air-passages, with decided doses 
of belladonna; the inhalation of steam, medi- 
cated or not as may suit the peculiar belief 
of the individual practitioner; the juice of 
the pineapple (Bromelin), with carbonate of 
soda in warm water, to be supplemented by 
the administration of a suitable amount of 
easily digested food. — Medical Brief.

obstruction with leakage, in a woman thirty 
years of age. The lecturer stated that his 
own experience with this drug had been un- 
satisfactory, and he had not used it for more 
than a year past. In the present instance, 
however, it had been prescribed by his chief 
of clinic, Doctor Riesman, in whose hands 
the result had certainly been good. He was 
therefore encouraged to renew his own re- 
sort to Cactus, and to give it for longer 
periods before again abandoning it. The 
dose, in the case demonstrated, was twenty 
drops three times a day. — Polyclinic. 



and scrotum, a condition so generally con- 
comitant with an anal itch. — La Semaine 
Me'dicale. 



Ergot in Periodic Neuralgia. — Doctor 
Thomson reports in the Medical Record four 
cases of very severe periodic neuralgia in 
which adminisiration of Ergot gave most 
pleasing results. He administers the fluid ex- 
tract combined with an equal quantity of the 
elixir of cinchona, the latter ingredient being 
added to prevent nausea. Two teaspoonfuls 
of this mixture are to be taken in water as 
soon as the premonitory symptoms are 
noticed, and the patient is directed to keep 
very quiet. If no relief follows, in an hour 
another dose may be given, and in another 
still another dose. Should the patient vomit, 
the drug may be given per rectum in two 
ounces of water. Careful attention to the 
condition of the alimentary canal is necessary 
between the attacks. — Therapeutic Gazette. 



In Endometritis. — The local treatment is 
often hampered by the presence in the cervi- 
cal canal of a plug of tenacious mucus or 
muco pus. the more so as it is difficult to re- 
move by cotton or antiseptic solutions. The 
application of alteratives without the pre- 
vious removal of the mucus is quite without 
effect, as very little of the solution comes in 
contact with the membranes. For the re- 
moval of this plug, Doctor Talley recommends 
that the cervical canal be washed with the 
official lime-water (U. S. P.), warmed, and ap- 
plied by means of small pieces of cotton 
twisted on the end of an applicator. — Poly- 
clinic. 



Hydrochlorate of Chalk for Pruritics Ani. — 
Take a piece of cotton gauze two or three 
centimeters long, which has been moistened 
with a solution of Hydrochlorate of Chalk, 
2: 100. Push up in the anus, and leave in 
place until sharp smarting commences. Then 
remove and wipe surface of anus dry, when 
:he itching immediately ceases. — If it should 
return, repeat the same procedure. It ap- 
pears that this solution simultaneously clears 
ap all the eczematous patches about the anus 



Medicine for Man, Not Man for Medicine. — 
Enthusiastic advocates of the use of com- 
pressed tablets seem disposed to trust to them 
too exclusively on account of convenience in 
dispensing them and their portability, which 
makes them acceptable to the physician and 
to many patients. We believe, however, that 
the best results are to be had from a skillful 
adaptation of different forms of medicines in 
different conditions and according to the 
exigencies of each case. — Doctor John V. 
Shoemaker. 



Chloral in Hcemoptysis. — In the Berliner 
Klinische Wochenschrift, Doctor Pal praises 
Chloral Hydrate very highly in the treatment 
of pulmonary haemorrhages when administered 
per rectum in doses of from fifteen to thirty 
grains. He declares its action is usually 
manifested in from thirty to forty minutes, 
and that it is rarely necessary to repeat 
the dose; moreover, it sometimes acts as a 
prophylactic. A normal heart is, of course, 
essential. 



Sparteine in Chloroformization. — By the hy- 
podermatic injection of one centigramme of 
morphine together with three to five centi- 
grammes of Sparteine sulphate, before chlor- 
oformization, one may obtain a rapid response 
to the anaesthetic, of which but a slight quan- 
tity will be necessary to maintain anaesthesia. 
The pulse continues regular and full, even if 
toxic apncea set in. — LANr.LOisand Murange, 
in Revue Internationale de Bibliographic Me'di- 
cale.

Cimicifuga and Caulophyllu?n. — Cimicifuga 
is very much valued in obstructed menses, 
leucorrhcea, rheumatism, and neuralgia. It 
may be compared with Caulophyllum, or blue

since both are valuable in the rheumatic dia-

Diabeti if Mental Shock.— Th&lt; 

a form, and a vei . form, of diabetes 

which is brought i ally in the young, 

by mental shock. I treated on this a good 

many yeai wing to my attention 

ing been turned to a striking case of the 
kind; and recently I have met with two other 
examples of the same nature The first 
that came under my notice was that of a boy 
about twelve years of age, the son of B I ai &gt; 
penter. He was a very bright little fellow, 
and had enjoyed all his life the best of 
heatlh, escaping remarkably from the usual 
infantile and childish diseases. Near where 
his father lived was a woodyard, kept by a 
very ungainly, Quilp-like sort of fellow, who 
delighted in rough jokes and in threatening 
weaker than himself. One of the freaks 
of this man was to tie up a very savage dog 
to a kennel in the yard. The pathway lead- 
ing to the office passed this kennel, but was 
so far distant that the dog at the length of 
his tether could not reach it by four or five 
feet. The little boy went down with a mes- 
sage from his father, knowing nothing of the 
chained animal; and when the dog suddenly 
burst out iij^on him, it so frightened him that 
he stood half-paralyzed, screamed, became 
faint, and got back home extremely ex- 
hausted. As if he had been mechanically 
injured in the brain near the fourtn ven- 
tricle, he began at once to pass large 
quantities of urine, which the practitioner J 
who was called in thought at first, naturally 
enough, manifested a mere hysterical condi- 
tion. Soon, however, it occurred to him that 
the diuresis was too prolonged. He there- 
fore tested for sugar, found it in abundant 
quantities in the urine, and brought the pa- 
tient to me. The poor boy remained under, 
our care until his death from diabetes, the 
disease running its course with great rapidity 
and defying every means of cure. We medi- 
cal men were of opinion that the savage who 
kept the woodyard was liable to an action 
for the injury done; but the lawyers whom 
his father consulted, including eminent coun- 
sel, were of opinion that there was no suffi- 
cient proof of a legal kind that could con- 
stitute a ground for action. They urged 
that a precedent was wanted to support the 
argument that diabetes could be induced by 
mental shock in the manner suggested; and 
so the idea of a trial was abandoned. 

I have now under my care a case of a sim- 
ilar kind. A young woman took fright in 
consequence of a fire which broke out near to 
her — on the floor, in fact, where she slept. 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 



127 



She was exceedingly alarmed, and was seized 
quickly afterwards with diabetic symptoms in 
an extreme degree. She is twenty-five years 
of age, and up to the time of her attack had 
enjoyed an unusually healthy life; but there 
is in her history this curious fact, that her 
brother, one year older, a few months ngo 
died from acute diabetes immediately follow- 
ing a severe mental shock. 

Physiologically there is nothing peculiar in 
these phenomena, for perhaps there is no fact 
more clearly established than that certain 
mechanical injuries to the brain are capable 
of setting up the diabetic condition. I have 
noticed that men engaged in whitewashing 
ceilings sometimes become giddy during their 
work, from the prolonged position of the head 
thrown backwards, and that a temporary dia- 
betes may then present itself. Four examples 
of this kind came before me when I was car- 
rying out my inquiries on occupation and 
health. Mental shock seems to lead to a 
similar state— it may be by rupture of a mi- 
nute vessel in the brain, or by a slight effusion. 
Whatever is the exact pathology, the mischief 
inflicted leads to one of the most serious types 
of the diabetic disease, and I call the atten- 
tion of other practitioners specially to it, that 
they may add their observations to mine on a 
verv important practical and medico-legal 
question. — Sir Benj. W. Richardson, in The 
Aidepiad. 



Serum Therapy — Two Views. — The Pos- 
itive: In going over the work in Berlin I was 
very much impressed by the fact that, among 
'these men who had been working up the 
subject for two or three years, or longer, and 
who had treated a large number of cases of 
diphtheria, the first series of five hundred 
having just then been completed, there was 
not the faintest shadow of a doubt as to the 
value of the antitoxin treatment. They 
seemed to feel absolutely convinced that the 
experimental stage had been passed, and that 
,the value of antitoxin as a specific in the 
, treatment of diphtheria was a thoroughly 
established fact. That seemed to me a most 
surprising and a most encouraging feature of 
I .he question at that time. And when one 
urns to the other side and considers for him- 
;elf the evidence to justify belief in the treat- 
nent, it seems to me he has even a stronger 
: &gt;asis for confidence than the positive testi- 
aonv of others. — Doctor Herman Biggs, 
n Medical Record. 

: The Negative: Highly favorable as have 
•een the majority of the numerous reports 
n the serum treatment of diphtheria, signs 
re not wanting that their roseate hue may 



somewhat fade before the searchlight of un- 
impassioned criticisms. Only recently Doctor 
Hansemann, one of Professor Virchow's as- 
sistants, drew attention to the liability of 
antitoxin to increase the diphtheritic ten- 
dency to nephritis, and both our home and 
foreign correspondents have given further 
evidence in this direction, as well as of other 
ill-effects in the shape of an increased pro- 
portion of deaths by cardiac failure, sep- 
ticaemia, etc. Reports which simply give 
statistics of decreased mortality, without any 
definite statement as to the mode of death, 
can afford us no information as to whether 
the effect of antitoxin on the vital organs is 
in excess of that which has been found to 
obtain under the older treatment. Since re- 
liable information in this direction can only 
be derived from carefully recorded autopsies, 
it is to be hoped that in every case of death 
under this treatment a post-mortem examina- 
tion will be made, so as to prevent us falling 
into a fool's paradise, the ejection from which 
could not but be attended by ignominy. — 
Medical Press and Circular. 



Obesity. — On several occasions stout 
female patients have asked my advice as to 
how they could reduce their size. I at once 
ask, "Are you thi sty?" and as a general n le 
am told, "Very!" Some even assure me 
they are obliged to rise at night to obtain 
water. This experience, coupled with the 
fact that one-third of the human body con- 
sists of fluid, led me to advise restriction of 
fluids, and that those allowed be as diuretic 
as possible. My contention is that fluids of 
all kinds fatten or bloat the body when used in 
excess. 

It is obvious that if a healthy man or 
woman have active kidneys and a normal 
perspiring skin, the fluids used cannot accu- 
mulate in the blood or tissues; and I have 
remarked that stout patients almost all drink 
in excess of the amount of urine secreted. I 
have known stout patients who had sought 
the advice of so-called specialists on obesity 
being told to be most particular with regard to 
food, amount of exercise, etc., while (they 
state) they were told nothing about the re- 
striction of fluids or how to get rid of such 
by purgatives, diuretics, and diaphoretics. I 
do not at all profess to treat obesity, but act- 
ing on the principles enunciated in this short 
paper I prohibit cold drinks of all kinds, a hot 
one assuaging the thirst much better. By 
the exhibition of saline purgatives in hot 
water taken each morning (fasting), diuretics, 
and diaphoretics, I find I can promise a stout

Doctor J. P. Gayon, 
of the City ^i Mexico, states that any simple 
ulceration under the local irritating influence 
of calomel, a caustic, or even from inflamma- 
tion of the tissue, may simulate chancre. The 
Site of the lesion exerts a great influence 
upon the development of induration, for in 
the nose and the ba'ano-preputial sulcus the 
anatomical disposition of the tissues and the 
lack of elasticity contribute to produce cir- 
cumscribed indurations. Any lesion of the 
superficial layers of the skin of a herpetic 
eruption in these regions may be complicated 
with an induration, without any specific ele- 
ment. Any lesion or eruption in the balano-

PSEUDO=CONTINUED FEVER. 

BY DOCTOR JOAO VINCENTE TORRES HOMEM.* 

The sole difference between pseudo-con- 
tinued and simple remittent fever is, that in 
the former the diminution of temperature is 
barely some tenths of a degree (Centigrade), 
rarely more than half a degree, so that it is 
very difficult and at times impossible to verify 
the existence of remission. I have observed 
cases where high fever continued during two, 
three, or more days, without any explanatory 
lesion or the manifestation of any other 
symptom leading to the presumption that it 
was a case of even mild typhoid fever in the 
first stage. It is in such cases that a dose of 
quinine, given after the promotion of profuse 
perspiration by means of diaphoretics, clears 
up the diagnosis, the pyrexia becoming mani- 
festly remittent. 

The pseudo-continued type in malarial 
fevers is very rare with us, and, in propor- 
tion as genuine typhoid is becoming more 
frequent, it grows rarer still. Yet it is in- 
cumbent on us not to lose sight of it, inas- 
much as the omission of appropriate treatment 
in such instances means the death of the pa- 
tient within a few days. I saw, in the hospital 
of Nossa Senhora d'Ajuda, a young Brazil- 
ian, twenty-four years of age, who had had 
fever for two days and who complained of an 
acute and very intense pain in the right 
hypochondrium; the liver was enlarged, and, 
believing it to be a case of acute hepatitis, I 
treated the patient accordingly. Two days 
after the use of leeches at the verge of the 
anus, wet cups and fomentations with mer- 
curial ointment applied to the hepatic region, 
and calomel and nitre in large doses, all the

local phenomena had disappeared, but the 
fever continued without appreciable remis- 
sion. I then decided to give three twelve- 
grain doses of quinine in the course of the 
day, dissolved in sulphuric lemonade. After 
the third dose the thermometer fell to 97. 2 
and the patient's body was bathed in profuse 
perspiration. I then ordered two table- 
spoonfuls of Agua Ingleza every hour, and 
good meat broth. The next day at 10.30 
a.m. the temperature was 98. 6°; I gave twelve 
grains of quinine; between five and six 
o'clock in the afternoon the young man had 
shivering-fits and head pains, and the tem- 
perature rose to 101.6 . There was not the 
least doubt that it was a case of malarial in- 
fection, revealed at its beginning by a con- 
tinued fever, and afterwards by an intermit- 
tent paroxysm — thanks to the effect of spe- 
cific medication. The following morning 
the thermometer indicated 98. 6°; the patient 
took eighteen grains of quinine, and con- 
valesced rapidly without further paroxysms. 
A young mulatto entered the clinical ward 
of the hospital, presenting a very intense fe- 
brile reaction, with all the characteristics of 
the fever which precedes the manifestation of 
variola. Two days elapsed, and the fever 
continued with the same intensity without 
the eruption appearing, in spite of the thera- 
peutic measures adopted to that end. The 
tongue, which at the beginning was still rosy 
and moist, became furred and dry. I ordered 
the patient a purgative of calomel, and, after 
it had operated, resorted to quinine. A few 
hours after the second dose of this drug, the 
temperature, which until then had stayed at 
104. 4 , fell to 101.5 ; it remained at this point 
until 9 a.m. of the next day, when the patient 
took eighteen grains more of quinine, and in 
the afternoon the thermometer indicated 
99. 1 °. The specific treatment was employed 
on a decreasing scale for three days longer, 
not because any paroxysm had appeared, but

ertain cases, pseudo-continued malarial 
fevei apanied by ( of some 

important like the brain, cord, lung, 

and diag the outset becomes 

very difficult. Pleuro-pulmonary hyperemia 
Is the physician to think of a 
simple pneumonia, inasmuch as the patient 
complains of severe stitch in the side, cough 
and dyspnoea, and spits blood; if together 
with these symptoms we take the initial chill, 
which is almost never wanting, and a temper- 
ature of 104 or 104.5°, tne error °f diagnosis 
heroines pardonable. Vet there is, in these 
difficult and embarrassing cases, one circum- 
stance of great value, to which the physician 
should always attend, for it greatly enlightens 
his judgment, or at least puts him on his 
guard — namely, the absence of physical signs, 
ally those furnished by auscultation, 
which are present in a true pulmonary inflam- 
mation. There is no fine crepitation, even 
when the patient coughs; there is no bron- 
chial respiration nor bronchophony; the ear 
barely perceives a very fine friction sound, 
superficial and circumscribed (due to the 
dryness of the pleura), and weakening of the 
respiratory murmur (due to the diminution 
in capacity of the pulmonary vesicles, con- 
nected with excessive fullness of the vessels 
which pa^s over their walls). 

There entered the hospital of Nossa Sen- 
hora d'Ajuda a patient in exactly this condi- 
tion: he had had an intense and prolonged 
chill; an acute and pricking pain below the 
right nipple, cough, dyspnoea and extreme 
febrile heat (105.5 ) were present. The in- 
terne who received him (one of the most dis- 
tinguished students of the sixth year of our 
university), in spite of the absence of the 
characteristic physical signs, diagnosed a 
pleuro-pneumonia and prescribed accord- 
ingly. The next day I diagnosed pseudo- 
continued malarial fever complicated by 
pulmonary congestion, and prescribed the 
sulphate of quinine exclusively for the space 
of four days. The patient, who was a young 
negro and very robust, recovered promptly. 

In February, 1873, I saw a patient in Sao 
Christovao who presented a very singular 
array of symptoms, which environed the 



- with serious difficulties He had 

fever, which dated from forty eight 
hours back, was somewhat delirious, ami had 

incomplete paralysis of the upper ami 

extremities and the bladder, accompanied by 
al hyperesthesia; the slightest pressure 
on any part of the body, particularly 
on its upper half, excited cries of pain. 
There was slight 1 n of the liver and 

Spleen; the tongue was slightly furred and 
the bowels constipated. At first sight it 
■ of spinal meningitis; but the 
absence of opisthotonos, the high degree of 
fever (105. 2 ), the hepato-splenic congestion, 
and above all the very important circum- 
stance of these symptoms having appeared 
rapidly, reaching their maximum gravity in 
two days, led me to presume that it was a 
malarial pyrexia of continued type, attended 
by hyperemia of the parts contained in th&lt; 
spinal canal. The treatment I advised, and 
which produced splendid results, was as fol-J 
lows: Twelve leeches to the verge of th&lt; 
anus; twelve wet cups along the spine; calo-l 
mel in purgative doses; and then half a 
drachm of quinine in solution, given in three 
doses. Twenty-four hours after this tieat-| 
ment the patient was extraordinarily im- 
proved. The quinine was continued foi 
several days, in decreasing doses, and con- 
valescence was manifest twelve days after. 

In the treatment of continued malarial 
fever, quinine should be given as soon as th&lt; 
diagnosis is established, even though th&lt; 
febrile reaction be intense. But it is impor- 
tant for the physician never to forget thi 
before administering the precious specific hi 
should fulfill certain previous indications- 
condition at times indispensable to the absorj 
tion and action of the drug: he must combal 
the gastro-intestinal disturbance- by mean? 
of an emetic and cathartic; remove vise era 
congestion by blood-letting, general or local 
profuse or moderate, in accordance with tht 
extent and severity of the hyperemia, age 
sex, temperament, and other individual pe 
culiarities of the patient, and according t&lt; 
the condition of the pulse and date of th 
disease.

pyrexias observed in Rio de Janeiro whic 
are not of malarial origin. The fever

denominated by the older authors synochal, 
angeiosthenic, gastric, and bilious, are likewise 
met with here, produced by general morbi- 
genic causes. Chill, insolation, dampness, 
irregularities of diet, indigestion, etc., often 
give rise to the appearance of febrile re- 
action, ordinarily of little severity, accom- 
panied by various symptoms connected with 
the organs the functions of which are by 
preference deranged. The digestive system 
is that most frequently compromised in these 
cases; sometimes it is the stomach that suf- 
fers, and the patient presents all the symp- 
toms inherent to gastric disturbance (gastric 
fever); sometimes it is the biliary system, 
and then there is an excess of bile thrown 
into the small intestine, part of which flows 
back into the stomach; the furred tongue as- 
sumes a yellowish color, there is great bitter- 
ness of the mouth, frequent nausea, and at 
times bilious vomiting and diarrhoea; the 
liver is a little enlarged {bilious fever, gastro- 
bilious fever). In other cases the tempera- 
ture is very high, the face becomes flushed 
and red, the eyes injected and weeping, the 
headache is intense, the pulse strong, full, 
hard, and frequent {angeiosthenic fever of the 
older authors, inflammatory fever). It is not 
rare to meet in practice with a certain num- 
ber of persons who, under the influence of 
the most insignificant causes, become fever- 
ish for several hours, without presenting any 
morbid symptoms except elevation of tem- 
perature, frequency of pulse, and a certain 
degree of malaise which obliges them to seek 
repose (febris ephemera) ; this morbid condi- 
tion is nearly always due to sudden checking 
of perspiration from a chill, and yields 
promptly as soon as the functions of the 
skin are reestablished. 

Simple gastric fever, according to the view 
1 expounded in the preceding paragraph, yields 
in twenty-four hours, or two days at most, 
after the use of emetic-cathartics and acid 
diluent drinks. An emetic of ipecac and five 
or ten centigrammes of antimony — thirty or 
forty grammes of sulphate of magnesia in 
case the first prescription does not produce 
large evacuations, — and lemonades after- 
wards, are the means to which the physician 
should confine himself. If in spite of these 
methods the fever continues, with exacerba- 
tions at certain hours of the day, the use of 



quinine becomes necessary. Any one wait- 
ing for the febrile reaction to become clearly 
remittent or intermittent before resorting to 
this remedy will oftentimes be painfully un- 
deceived by seeing a series of grave symp- 
toms due to a pernicious paroxysm make 
their appearance. In many cases, as soon as 
the emetic and cathartic have acted, I make 
use of quinine, even though the disease dates 
from a few hours only; it is a method of 
prudence and precaution the more commend- 
able according as the patient's condition is 
satisfactory and the axillary temperature near 
the normal. In a city like Rio de Janeiro, 
where the malarial element is always predom- 
inant in the medical constitution, and where 
the complications produced by it in the 
course of acute diseases are so frequent as 
well as so symptomatically various, where 
malarial poisoning at times reveals itself by a 
single simple febrile paroxysm, and a perni- 
cious paroxysm follows this with nothing to 
foretell it, the practice which I pursue, and 
which I always counsel to my pupils, cannot 
be without advantage. After the first dose 
of quinine — never less than one gramme for 
an adult — we should wait for the further 
progress of the disease to indicate whether 
or not to insist upon the use of the remedy. 
How often does a patient present himself 
with a simple fever, apparently not of the 
slightest gravity, attributed by him to check- 
ing of perspiration (commonly termed a 
cold), which notwithstanding is the expres- 
sion of a paroxysm due to malaria! How 
often does the sulphate of quinine, oppor- 
tunely administered — not as being impera- 
tively demanded, but as a simple precaution- 
ary measure — prevent a pernicious attack! 

There entered the University Hospital a 
Portuguese lad, fourteen years old, a clerk in 
the Prahia dos Mineiros, with fever and pain 
in the head. Except the high temperature 
(102. 6°), the frequency of the pulse (104), 
and the frontal headache (which was not se- 
vere), no morbid symptom was observed. 
The abdominal viscera were normal; the 
tongue was slightly coated. The disease 
dated scarcely eight hours back. The in- 
terne who received the patient prescribed at 
5 p.m. a diaphoretic mixture, which produced 
copious perspiration. At the visit next morn- 
ing 1 found the boy entirely apyretic and

without headache; he considered himsel 

and asked f«&gt;r \im\\. I prescribed one gramme 

of sulphate of quinine, which was taken in my 

d it on the ground that 

- nothing more- the matter with him. 

This circumstance happened I large 

number of students, and was noticed 00 ac- 
count of the severity with which I threatened 
to punish the child, who obstinately rej&lt; 

the vessel containing the remedy, not know- 
is rejecting life. At 3 p.m. the 

patient v. 1 with an intense chill, 

wed by fever; the interne found him 
somewhat delirious, with the liver a little 
congested, and an axillary temperature of 
ire paroxysm had appeared, not- 
withstanding the dose of quinine taken at 9 
in the morning. Is it not probable that this 
vsm would have been very grave, if not 
even fatal, had not the drug been prescribed ? 
The third attack was manifested only by 
some elevation of temperature (100. S ). Ai 
the end of ten days the lad left the hospital, 
cured. 

Let us suppose for a moment that my pa- 
tient had had nothing but an ephemeral fever, 
caused by suppression of perspiration, and 
that the dose of quinine he was forced to 
take was unnecessary; what harm could have 
resulted? Absolutely none. This and many 
other cases I have observed, in private prac- 
tice as well as in hospitals, led me to give 
my pupils the following advice; " Whenever 
you observe high febrile reaction unaccom- 
panied by any lesion which can account for 
it, give the patient a dose of quinine as soon 
as he becomes apyretic; you will never have 
occasion to regret such procedure; on the 
contrary, you will avoid cruel deceptions for 
your understanding, and acute tortures for 
your conscience." 

When the fever assumes the bilious char- 
acter, without, however, being the bilious re- 
mittent fever of the tropics, calomel in purga- 
tive dose should be employed at once, or 
podophyllin, the cholagogue properties of 
which are well known. After the appearance 
of bilious stools thus produced, we should 
have recourse to drinks containing nitre and 
to strongly acidulated lemonades. If the 
liver is greatly enlarged, due to active con- 
gestion of its parenchyma, the physician can- 
not dispense with the use of wet cups to the 



hepatic region, followed bj t applica 

: mercurial ointment and I 
belladonna, [pecac ia always indicated in 

this case, before or after the calomel, when

Although I re 'hat mild bilious 

. very different in its course and its 
gravity from the so-called bilious fever of 
the tropics, may in some cases be due to 
other causes than the malarial miasm, and 
the patient's cure be effected without the us 
of quinine, yet, from fear of a perniciou 
paroxysm, which may supervene insidiously 
without being announced by simple inter- 
mittent attacks, it is very rarely that I do noi 
resort to this heroic treatment after the vmn 
iting and bilious stools produced by ipeca 
and calomel. 

This practice, which I have always fo 
lowed, is that followed by the most eminen 
practitioners of Rio de Janeiro; even thoi 
who most fully embrace the opinion of Feli 
Jacquot, who admits the existence of a ma- 
larial bilious fever and a climatic one, do n 
lay aside quinine. 

In a great number of cases irritability o: 
the stomach does not allow the administra 
tion of the drug by the mouth, since it is im 
mediately rejected by vomiting; we shoul 
then resort to enema, dissolving the quini 
in a small amount of fluid, and adding a fe 
drops of laudanum. 

In the inflammatory or angeiosthenic fever 
— so termed on account of the strength and 
fullness of the pulse, the high temperature, 
intensity of the headache, redness and flush- 
ing of the face, and injection and brilliancy 
of the eyes — the physician is often obliged 
resort to blood-letting, especially when t 
patient is young, robust, and of sangui 
temperament. General bleeding is only ex- 
ceptionally employed; depletion is almoft 
always effected by means of leeches applied 
to the verge of the anus. 

Tartar-emetic in the dose of ten centi- 
grammes, calomel, and nitre are of great sejjfj 
vice in this species of pyrexia; sulpha 
quinine is almost always employed among us, j 
either because the course of the disease ren- 1 
ders it indispensable, or as a measure of pru-l 
dence and precaution for the reasons already ; 
set forth.

LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF MEDI- 
CINE.* 

BY ROSWELL PARK, A.M., M.D. 

(Copyrighted.) 

[Continued from page ffj.~\ 

In the domain of pathology the Arabs 
added only a very small number of observa- 
tions to those contained in the works of 
Galen. The most interesting of these per- 
tain to eruptive fevers. Most of the writers 
contented themselves with making an inven- 
tory of the acquisitions of the past, as did 
Guy de Chauliac, and this was about all they 
could do under existing circumstances; al- 
though they did not make discoveries, they 
prepared the way for their successors. 

Two men about this time did a great deal 
in the direction of creating a desire for post- 
mortem study of cases, and in illustrating and 
succinctly describing symptoms. 

The first of these was Benivieni, a Floren- 
tine, who died in 1502, — the date of his birth 
being uncertain. To him more than to any 
other we owe the commencement of the study 
of gross pathology and pathological anatomy. 
He was the first to consider the knowledge 
that' might be obtained by opening bodies for 
the sole purpose of ascertaining the location 
and cause of the diseases from which they 
had died. As Malgaigne remarks, " a eulogy 
which he merits and which he shared with no 
Dther person, and which has not been ac- 
corded to him up to this time by the many 
historians of surgery who have superficially 
"searched among these precious sources, is 
hat he was the first who had the habit, felt 
he need, and set the useful example, which 
e transmitted to his successors, of searching 
ci the cadaver, according to the title of his 
00k, for the concealed causes of disease." 
'he work referred to by Malgaigne was en- 
ded " Concerning Some of the Secret and 
trange Causes of Disease," and was pub- 
shed in Florence in 1507. It is poor in quo- 
itions, but rich in original observations, 
hich pertain especially to the aetiology of 
sease, and gives a very concise symptoma- 
I'logy and history of each affection of which 
1 treats, as well as a pathological explana- 
i)n. Benivieni's observations on gallstone, 

* Delivered in the Medical Department of the 
liversity of Buffalo, session of 1894-5. 



on the anatomical lesions of heart diseases, 
and on the conveyance of syphilis from the 
mother to the foetus, were original, as well as 
many observations concerning the presence 
of worms and other parasites in the body. 

He did not limit himself to dissection of 
his own cases, but sought autopsies in the 
cases of others. He examined the bodies of 
those who had been hung, always thinking to 
find in them something of interest. In this 
regard he was followed by one already men- 
tioned, namely Eustachius. 

After these two the men who most culti- 
vated pathology and anatomy in the sixteenth 
century were Rembert Dodoens and Marcel- 
lus Donatus. The former was born in 15 17 
in Mecheln, traveled extensively, was physi- 
cian to Maximilian II. and the Emperor 
Rudolph, and died in 1585. The latter lived 
and worked in the latter half of the sixteenth 
century, the dates of his birth and death 
being somewhat uncertain. 

The next man whom we must mention is 
one who did a great deal for internal medi- 
cine, pathology, and anatomy. Jean Fernel, 
who has been surnamed "the modern Galen," 
was born in Clermont in 1497. Even as a 
boy he showed great aptitude, and very early 
made himself a reputation in philosophy, law, 
and mathematics. In 1530 he was received 
as doctor with the unanimous applause of 
the entire faculty of Paris. He seems to 
have been stimulated by this only to more 
extended study; in fact, so hard did he work 
at his studies that his friends became seriously 
alarmed for his health and remonstrated with 
him; they received for reply, "Destiny reserves 
for us repose enough." He became physician 
to King Henry II. of France, and in the midst 
of a very extensive practice undertook to 
collect all the medical knowledge scattered 
in the Greek, Arabic, and Latin works, in 
order to form from it a body of doctrines. 
His work was written with a purity and ele- 
gance of Latin that reminds one of Cicero. 
Throughout its pages he was philosophic 
and sought to unite the apparently irrecon- 
cilable doctrines of Plato and Aristotle. 

He divided medical science into three 
great sections — physiology, pathology, and 
therapeutics. In his explanations of disease 
he was too often fanciful, following the 
speculations mainly of Galen, and making

led, if it exists idiopathically or by sym- 
pathy, or if it be kept up by some exterior 
cause, lie who pretends to be a rational 
physician must sound each of these subjects 
and discern them by certain signs." The 
problem which he thus set himself he cer- 
tainly, for his own part, considered as solved, 
although it was not long before his solutions 
were set aside and the original uncertainty 
reappeared. 

In therapeutics he very early laid down 
the fundamental maxim that every disease 
must be combated by contrary remedies, 
justifying this by every species of argument 
— amounting to this, that every disease must 
be combated by its contrary because all that 
cures a disease is contrary to it. This was 
in part the doctrine of "Contraria contrariis 
curcuilur" the antithesis of the equally ab- 
surd sophism, "Similia similibus curantur" 
which three hundred years later was erected 
into an excuse for the foundation of an al- 
leged new school. There can be no doubt 
that Fernel rendered very great service to 
his time and to subsequent generations, de- 
spite the fact that his recommendations and 
statements were too often founded upon 
sophistry. 

Just here we must digress for a moment to 
consider the status of bleeding. Hippocrates 
and Galen had advised to bleed largely from 
the arm on the affected side in pleurisy and 
pneumonia. That practice was gradually 
abandoned as Greek traditions were lost 
sight of, and finally the Arabs substituted for 
it something entirely different, namely, prick- 
ing a vein in the foot in order to let blood 
flow drop by drop. Their method prevailed 
throughout Europe until the commencement 
of the sixteenth century, or about the time 
when Fernel appeared upon the scene. A 
Parisian physician named Brissot had revived 
the ancient (the Greek) practice during an 



mic of pleurisy, and had obtained I 
tonishing success, which he bastei 
publish, commending the method empl 

great uproar in the 
medical world. The innovation found 
ami defenders, and disputes grew warn;. 
to the fever point. Finally th&lt; 
method u !. and Fernel 

pted it. 

Felix Plater was born in 1536 in 1 
Switzerland, and died in 1614. He had 
several sons who made their mark in medi- 
cine. In his large work, which preceded that 
ernel, he took perhaps the first step in an 
unexplored route, namely, in the classifica- 
tion of dta ording to the totality 
parent symptoms. Defective as this classifica- 
tion appears in our eyes, its author lived a 
long life as a very distinguished practitioner 
and professor in his native town. 

Giovanni Batista Porta was born in Naples 
in 1536, traveled extensively in Italy, France, 
and Spain, and founded in 1560 an Academy 
of the Segreti. He was accused of magic, 
and was compelled to refute the charges in 
Rome. He died in 161 5, having been one of 
the leading scientists of his time and the 
founder of modern optics. In the first 
edition of his " Magia Naturalist published 
in Naples, 1587, is tound the first description 
of the camera obscura — of course in a very 
incomplete form and without lenses. 

Severino was a celebrated surgeon of 
Naples. He was born in 1580 in Calabria, 
studied in Naples, became a doctor in Saler- 
num, and then became professor of anatomy 
in his native town. For a long time the 
victim of intrigue and of persecution by the 
Inquisition, he was finally driven out of 
Naples, but was called back by the populace. 
He then became the most celebrated teacher 
of his time, writing extensively on a variety 
of subjects. He died in 1656 of the plague, 
an epidemic of which was at that time raging 
in central Italy. 

Arriving now at the surgery of this Age, 
we find that matters were more chaotic than 
in other departments of medicine, and for 
reasons which are easily given and appreci- 
ated. While ordinarily external disease are 
more easily discerned than internal, and 
while in a corresponding degree they can be 
more satisfactorily treated — while, in other

words, external pathology has ordinarily 
taken precedence of internal in professional 
as in lay minds— this view seems to have 
been inverted for a time during the Middle 
Ages. Previous to the period now under dis- 
cussion the sciences had generally declined 
in Europe, and surgery had fallen even lower 
than Vnedicine — for the reason that medicine 
was in the hands of the priests, who had at 
that time something of a liberal education, 
while the practice of surgery was abandoned 
to a class of ignorant barbers, bathers, and 
bone-setters. No mechanic or artisan could 
take as an apprentice any youth without a 
certificate affirming his legitimate birth and 
that he came of a family in which there were 
neither barbers, bath-keepers, shepherds, nor 
butchers. Among the men who were thus 
made social outcasts were those into whose 
hands most of the surgery of the fifteenth cen- 
tury fell. This was particularly the case in 
Germany, and other European countries 
were little in advance. We have seen that 
in France and in Italy Lanfranc and Guy de 
Chauliac did their best to rescue surgery from 
the hands of these men, but that their efforts 
did not prevent it from being completely 
abandoned by the clergy who devoted them- 
selves to the practice of medicine. 

When we come to inquire the reason for 
this — in other words, why an art so useful as 
surgery, and one which made such require- 
ments for knowledge, sagacity, and dexterity, 
whose necessity was almost continually felt, 
particularly during those troublous times of 
almost constant warfare, should be so neg- 
lected by men who could best comprehend 
its utility and respond to its requirements — 
it is difficult to find a satisfactory answer. 
The social condition of the times sheds 
some light upon the question. The nations 
of southern Europe were socially divided at 
:hat time into the nobility, who were nearly 
Jways at war; the clergy, who monopolized 
earning and filled the so-called liberal pro- 
essions; and finally the common people, who 
: vere common prey for both the other classes, 
: .nd who yet had to support both without 
laving any privileges of their own. While 
he practice of medicine was a clerical right, 
'he canon of the church prohibited physicians 
rom drawing blood, under pain of excom- 
munication; and hence surgery, shunned by 



the priests, to whom it naturally belonged in 
connection with the practice of medicine, fell 
into the hands of the ignorant and vulgar, 
who practiced it in a purely mechanical way 
without knowledge or appreciation of its 
possibilities. In addition to this, there was 
an almost total lack of detailed and precise 
anatomical knowledge, and but small reason 
to expect that the ignorant practitioners of 
surgery would feel the need of such knowl- 
edge. Moreover, most of the operators were 
itinerants, going from city to city, stopping 
so long as they had cases to operate upon or 
until some reverse forced tnem to depart. 
Most of these men limited themselves to one 
or two sorts of operations. Some operated 
for cataract, others for stone, others for her- 
nia, nearly every one having a secret method 
which was transmitted to his posterity as a 
heritage. 

In the history of medicine certain family 
names of itinerant operators have been pre- 
served; for example, the Branca, the Norsini, 
in Italy, and the Colot in France. 

Under such conditions there could be no 
such thing as the profession of the surgeon. 
The prejudice against dissection did not 
begin to abate until the thirteenth century, 
when a very few of the clergy dared in a very 
timid manner to perform surgical operations. 
Their numbers increased in the course of the 
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and in the 
sixteenth had become considerable. Most of 
the great anatomists of that period, such as 
Benivieni, De Carpi, Vesalius, Fallopius, and 
Fabricius ab Aquapendente, were great sur- 
geons. 

In due time it came about that while the 
clerical physicians were willing to descrnd to 
the rank of operators, the lay surgeons as- 
pired to the rank ot doctors of medicine. 
This transformation took place especially in 
France, the only country where at that time 
there was a special college of surgeons — the 
small brotherhood of St. Come, already al- 
luded to, which was always contending against 
the faculty on one hand and against the barber 
surgeons on the other, with varying results, 
and which at last sought peace with the Uni- 
versity and was received by it. This took 
place in 15 15, and was the renaissance of 
surgery, not only for Paris but for the whole 
world. By this reunion the faculty acquired

authority over the barbers, who were- admitted 
to their lectures ami took I anatomy 

and 51 radoally attaining a k 

which entitled them to be called barber-sur- 
geons; their rights were not curtailed, but 

made more difficult of procurement, for in 
addition to passing their initiation for the 
privilege of becoming barber-surgeons, they 
also had I .;i examination before the 

physicians and the two surgeons of the King, 
at Chatelet, for the right to practice surgery. 
The surgeons, as the price of their submission 
to the faculty, had, beside the university priv- 
ilege, a sort of supremacy over the barbers; 
and thus it happened that the barbers were 
admitted to the rank of surgeons at St. Come, 
and that the surgeons of St. Come were ad- 
mitted as barber-surgeons by the faculty of 
medicine. In this double capacity they ap- 
proached nearer the profession of medicine, 
from which they should never have been 
separated, while surgery became an art which 
received numerous improvements. We must 
now devote a little time to the consideration 
of at least two or three of the men who most 
contributed to extend and elevate it. 

Among those who most contributed to make 
the period of which we are now speaking a 
glorious one, raising himself from the lowest 
walks of life to the attainment of the highest 
professional honors, is Ambrose Pare, whose 
name will never die while the art of surgery 
is taught. Pare was born about the year 
15 10, at Laval, of poor parents. He was an 
early apprentice to the provincial barber-sur- 
geons, after which a natural ambition for im- 
provement led him to Paris (about the year 
1532), where he studied three years at the 
Hotel Dieu, and obtained the confidence of 
his teachers to such an extent that he- some- 
times operated for them. He never learned 
Latin, the language at that time of the books 
and of the schools. Pare was most fond of 
recalling his hospital experience; he counted 
it among the highest honors of his life that 
he should have enjoyed what he there did 
enjoy, and gives us to suppose that he was a 
favorite upon whom peculiar favors were 
conferred. In one of his writings, a physi- 
cian of Milan having expressed astonishment 
at so young a man's knowledge, he remarks 
with pride: " Put the good man did not know 
that I had been house surgeon for three years 



at the Hotel Diet) The fun. 

of the barber apprentices in the hospital in 

days were probably to make dressings 
and bleedings, and sometimes post-mortem 
examinations ordered by tin- chiefs 

the latter in their operations, and to a 

emergency; in other to do 

about as the intones at present do. They 
probably found there a precious and rare op- 
portunity for anatomical dissection, but it 
does not appear that they had regular clini- 
cal instruction. Communication between 
r and pupil depended absolutely on the 
pleasure of the fo: mer. 

In 1 was made surgeon to the 

Colonel General of Infantry, Rene de Monti- 
jean, with whom he made his first campaign 
in Italy. (This was in the army which King 
Francis I. assembled in Provence with which 
to repulse the invasion of Charles V.) He had 
never seen war nor recent gunshot wounds, 
and only knew of them by what he had read 
in the writings of John de Vigo. Thi 
at a time when it was the custom of surgeons 
to pour boiling oil into every amputation or 
other wound, in order to check haemorrhage; 
and Pare's experience in this his first cam- 
paign put him in the way of his first discov- 
ery—a discovery which will never be forgot- 
ten. He has recounted in his ' 4 Pook of 
Arquebus Wounds," and in his great " Apol- 
ogy," how after the affair of Pas-de-Suze he 
watched the other surgeons, dreaming of 
nothing else but to imitate them as far as he 
could; how the boiling oil gave out; how his 
anxiety about it prevented him from sleep- 
ing; and how to his great wonder he found 
that the wounded who had submitted to the 
operation suffered more than the others. 
This set him to thinking, and led him, a 
young man without name or authority, with- 
out letters or philosophical studies, to ob- 
serve, to reason, and to combat a doctrine 
which was universally admitted and which 
the highest surgical authorities of the da; 
sustained. At that time all authors who hai 
spoken of gunshot wounds considered them 
as poisonous and complicated with burns; 
consequently they gave the precept to cau- 
terize with boiling oil or a red-hot iron, and at 
the same time to administer certain alexi- 1 
pharmics which should serve as internal anti- 
dotes. John de Vigo, physician to Pope 



j 






THE MEDICAL AGE. 



137 



Julius II., assures us that the danger of these 
wounds results from the round formation of 
the balls, from heat, and from the poisonous 
qualities communicated to them by the pow- 
der. His theory and the method of treat- 
ment above given had been adopted without 
contradiction until the day when Pare* dared 
to utter the first protest against them. 

After a campaign of three years, in which 
he lost his master, he returned to Paris and 
married. In 1543 he was in the army of 
Perpignan, in the service of De Rohan, grand 
lord of Brittany, where he gave continuous 
proof of his sagacity. It was after this cam- 
paign that his reputation, so well established 
among warriors and the nobility, inspired 
Sylvius with the desire of seeing him. Par6 
has recounted how, in a conversation which 
they had together, he insisted upon the then 
entirely new precept of which he had made 
many applications, that in order to extract 
bullets it was best to place the wounded in 
the position in which they were at the mo- 
ment of injury. Sylvius, then at the height 
of his fame, invited the young physician to 
dinner, and listened to him with great atten- 
tion while he explained his views on gunshot 
wounds, which made such an impression upon 
the mind of the host that he besought him 
eagerly to write them out and make them 
public. Encouraged by this advice from so 
high a source, Pare prepared his text, illus- 
trated it, and in the year 1545 brought out 
his little work, which marked in a manner so 
glorious the revival of French surgery. It 
wa.s published by Gaulterot, the sworn book- 
seller of the University of Paris, and was 
entitled " The Manner' of Treating Wounds 
made by Arquebuses and other Fire-Arms, 
and those made by Arrows, Darts, and the 
Like; and also by Burns made Especially by 
Gunpowder. Composed by Ambrose Pare, 
Master Barber-Surgeon in Paris." 

A few months later appeared the second 
edition, in which he still recommended the 
ictual cautery in haemorrhage; but each day 
lie meditated upon the subject, and on one 
&gt;ccasion discussed it with two surgeons of 
. St. Come, submitting to them the idea that, 
&gt;ince ligatures were applied to veins and ar- 
enes and to recent wounds, there was nothi- 
ng to prevent their being equally applied to 
imputations. Both agreed with him, and 



opportunity soon presented itself at the siege 
of Damvilliers, when a gentleman had his leg 
crushed by a shot from the fortress. Pare 
made an amputation, omitting for the first 
time the use of the cautery, and had the hap- 
piness to save his patient, who, full of joy at 
having escaped the red-hot iron, said he had 
got clear of his leg on very good terms. 
This was in truth the actual renaissance of 
surgery, which had been to that time a tor- 
ture, but which became thereafter a blessed 
art. It was a barber-surgeon who produced 
the double marvel. This took place in 1552. 

In 1554, after other campaigns, Pare" was 
made, without examination, master of the 
college of St. Come, and in 1559 was included 
among the surgeons of King Henry II. (who 
was killed in a tourney, in Paris, in 1559), 
which position he retained with Francis II. 
and Charles IX. The latter raised him to 
the highest position among his surgeons, and 
King Henry III. retained him, which caused 
the witty and true remark that the kings of 
France transferred him to their successors as 
a legacy of the crown. 

Many anecdotes are related of Pare to 
show the remarkable esteem in which he was 
held by public and private citizens. For in- 
stance, in October, 1552, one of the most 
eminent generals of Charles V. laid siege to 
the city of Metz, and the Emperor came in 
person to join the army. Within the walls 
of this beleaguered city were gathered near- 
ly all the nobility and princes of France. 
The city was defended by the Duke of Guise, 
and the besieged soldiers were at that time 
suffering alike from the attacks of the enemy, 
the results of the siege, and the rigors of a 
frightful winter. The Duke had established 
two hospitals for the soldiers, and had put 
into requisition the barber-surgeons of the 
city, giving them money with which to fur- 
nish their supplies. But these surgeons were 
sadly incompetent against the combination 
of unfavorable circumstances, consequently 
nearly all the wounded perished, and a hor- 
rible suspicion was roused among the soldiers 
that they had been poisoned. Under these 
circumstances the Duke dispatched one of 
his captains to the King to say that the place 
could hold out for ten months, and asked at 
the same time for fresh medicine. The King 
sent for Pare, gave him money, directed him

to take all the medicine he thought m 
ami famished him a letter to Ma: 
Andre, who commanded in Verdun and i 
bribed an Italian captain for 1,500 c: 
introduce into the bes ilebrated 

surgeon. The expedition was perilous, and 
Pare himself would have willingly remained 
in Paris. But he entered Met/, on the 8th of 
December at midnight, without an accident. 

Having passed already sixteen years in war, 

he was known to the chiefs and common 
soldiers. The day after his arrival, the Duke, 
who knew how to strike the imagination, 
presented him on the ramparts to all the 
princes, lords, and captains, who embraced 
and received him with clamor. By the 
soldiers he was received with shouts of tri- 
umph. "We shall not die," they exclaimed, 
"even though wounded. Bare is among us." 
From this time the defense was conducted 
with renewed vigor, and it has been univer- 
sally conceded that to the presence of this 
single man the city was indebted for its sal- 
vation. The siege itself was not raised until 
after a terrific conflict. On the very day of 
Fare's arrival he began to treat the leg of 
one of the prominent officers, who for four 
days had been in charge of a charlatan and 
had suffered horrible tortures. The next day 
he decided to trephine another, who had been 
struck on the head by a fragment of stone, 
and who had been insensible for fourteen 
days. Both patients recovered. 

The little brotherhood of surgeons of St. 
Come were ready to seize on every circum- 
stance which might redound to their advan- 
tage, and desired to have within their ranks 
the man who enjoyed such great renown. 
They therefore admitted him to an examina- 
tion, in spite of the statute which required 
that the candidate should understand Latin, 
and in spite of opposition by the professors 
of the University. They not only admitted 
him to all their degrees, but awarded him a 
reception — a hitherto unknown honor. 

Pare" in his time met with a success which 
to-day would be pronounced extraordinary. 
He seemed to inspire the wounded with the 
utmost confidence, and to possess greatness 
and firmness of character in the highest de- 
gree. It is perhaps even more extraordinary 
that with so strong a character he should have 
so long retained favor at court. In the midst 



of ti 1 ment of camps, and a \&lt; • 

tended practice, he found I til that 

had been published on his art, and to com-, 

pose hinu of works 

riching all branches of surgery. Inst. 
keeping secret his inv&lt; 

tom of the time, he made them as public as 
possible, saying in the preface of his large 
work on surgery: "For my part I have dis- 
pensed liberally to everybody the gifts that 
God has conferred upon me, and I am none 
the worse for it; just as the light of a candle 
will not diminish, no matter how many may 
come to light their torches by it." 

Besides his smaller treatises, his large col- 
lective works passed through a number of 
editions, and were everywhere reprinted and 
studied. Not only was he great in surgery, 
but he attained a high degree of expert- 
ness in midwifery. Among other things, he 
restored the forgotten practice of podalic 
version in cases where this procedure is 
necessary. He died in 1590. 

The doctrine of Pare' on gunshot wounds 
was rapidly disseminated. From 1550, Maggi 
of Bologna advocated it without giving credit 
to its real author, and sustained it by decisive 
experiments. He observed that none of the 
wounded felt any heat, and that the torn 
portions of their clothing showed no trace on 
fire; and he shot balls through packages oil 
powder without setting them on fire. At tt 
same time Lange spread this view in (ier 
many, and Botal of Turin took it up (keep 
ing back, however, the true author's name). 

While Ambrose Pare did not disdain to slc\ 
as accoucheur, it was his friend and pup : 
Jacob Guillemeau (1550-1613) who in th 
sixteenth century most occupied himself wit 
the practice of obstetrics. We owe to Gui 
lemeau the first improvements that the moc^ 
erns made in this art — for instance, 
proposition to rapidly and artificially terra 
nate parturition in cases of considerate 
haemorrhage or when the woman is tak&lt; 
with convulsions during labor. Guillem&lt; 
supported this practice on the authority 
Hippocrates, and operated on a great numb- 
of patients, proving its value and the dang 
of its neglect. 

The Cesarean operation was known totl 
ancient Greeks and Romans, but had be« 
abandoned during the Middle Ages. 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 



139 



mained for the accoucheurs and surgeons of 
the sixteenth century to reestablish it. Among 
others, Rousset, physician to the Duke of 
Savoy, who recommended it very warmly, re- 
ported several cases where it had a happy issue 
for both mother and child. He even reported 
the most remarkable case of all, that of a 
woman who was six times delivered by this 
operation, and who perished in the seventh 
confinement because, as he states, the surgeon 
who had been accustomed to operate on her 
was absent. Unfortunately this case is not 
authenticated. 

Nothing shows better how the art of ob- 
servation and accurate description of phe- 
nomena had progressed at the time of the 
revival of letters than the number of new 
diseases of which the authors of that period 
make mention. Then for the first time did 
one read of whooping-cough, miliaria, scurvy, 
plica polonica, syphilis, and raphania. It is 
scarcely credible that these diseases fell upon 
Europe at this particular time. It is more 
probable that they had a more ancient exist- 
ence and were not recognized. 

Even to-day medical men are divided in 
(their opinions on the origin of syphilis, some 
believing that it was developed spontaneously 
in Europe toward the close of the sixteenth 
century, others that it was imported from 
the New World, others that it had a most 
ancient origin, and others yet that it repre- 
sent a degenerated form of leprosy. 

Certain it is that syphilis appeared almost 

rimultaneously in all parts of Europe, at 

Bologna, Halle, Brunswick, in Lombardy, 

Vpulia, Auvergne, and so on. Leonicenus 

' ittributed this sudden outbreak to an extra- 

&gt;rdinary inundation that occurred in all parts 

, &gt;f Italy towards the close of the fourteenth 

entury, and supported his views with the 

uthority of Hippocrates and Galen. Others 

ttributed it to astrological influence; while 

-ill others regarded it as a scourge of God 

dth which to punish men and turn them 

way lrom unbridled libertinism. Fallopius 

lought venereal disease was engendered by 

ie poison which the perfidious Neapolitans 

ad thrown into the wells from which the 

rench drew their water. These wild views 

mply indicate \he spirit of the age. Oviedo 

ublished in 1545 a history of the West Indies 

1. 1 which he states that syphilis originated in 



America. He held that when Columbus re- 
turned from his second expedition to the 
New World, in 1496, his men enlisted" under 
Gonsalvo de Cordova to go and fight the 
French, who had invaded the kingdom of 
Naples, and that they communicated to the 
French and Neapolitans the disease which 
they had brought from San Domingo. Un- 
happily for his veracity it is certain that 
syphilis broke out in Naples at least two years 
before the arrival of the Spanish fleet. It is 
equally certain that at none of the points at 
which Columbus touched on his return from 
his first expedition was there any manifesta- 
tion of syphilis for years. 

At this time the venereal disease, so-called, 
included those conditions which we now 
differentiate under the names of syphilis, 
chancroid, and gonorrhoea — a confusion of 
diseases which persisted even up to the time 
of John Hunter. It is worth while to publish 
this fact, since writers of two or three hun- 
dred years ago may not have meant by the 
term syphilis just what we would mean to-day. 
Without going into this question here, it is 
enough to say that one who reads intelligently 
may see in the sacred Scriptures unmistakable 
allusions to this disease. If the statements 
of David, as contained in the Psalms, are 
reliable, he was himself a serious sufferer 
from it. The ancient Greek and Arabian 
physicians make mention of lesions which 
could only be attributed to this disease; and 
the Latin satirists, like Horace and Juvenal, 
describe symptoms of a certain kind as being 
the fruit only of shameful practices. 

It is most likely that the sudden appear- 
ance of syphilis in nearly all parts of Europe 
at about the same time, which has been re- 
garded as so extraordinary, can be explained 
by the clearer distinctions physicians began 
to make between symptoms of this disease 
and those of leprosy. Arrangements for the 
cure of lepers were very complete, and such 
syphilitic patients as responded kindly to the 
treatment thereby established themselves in 
a very different category of disease. 

The first writer to systematically consider 
venereal disease was Astruc, who was born in 
Languedoc in 1684, and died in 1766. He 
was the principal advocate of the view that 
syphilis had an American origin, in which 
view he was bitterly opposed by Sanchez, a 



140 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 



Portuguese physician, who collected a large 
amount of evidence to the effect that its first 
ravages were observed in Italy. 

Summing up this whole matter, uc mav 
agree with Jourdan, who has examined all 
the opinions of these writers, and who in his 
treatise published in [826 concluded that all 
symptoms which had been hitherto connected 
with syphilis had been known and described 
from the remotest antiquity, but were not 
supposed to proceed from a common source 
and to be attached to the same cause until 
after the close of the fifteenth century. 

["HE INFLUENCE OF THE OCCUL1 SCIENCES ON 
Till-. MEDICINE of this PERIOD. 

Most of the partisans of occult science were 
restless minds such as are found in all ages, 
who chafed under the yoke of authority, and 
who practiced as well as deduced their lines 
of thought and conduct in accordance with 
their own ideas. Some of these men did not 
lack in sagacity, imagination, or audacity, but 
almost all of them lacked in consistency of 
idea and dignity of thought. Most of them 
lived isolated lives, apart from each other and 
from the rest of the world, and were to a large 
extent what we would now regard as "cranks." 
While they made a wide departure from accred- 
ited doctrine, they depended upon imagination 
rather than upon reason. This happened to 
be a period, however, when such men achieved 
great notoriety — more so than the same class 
of individuals have done since their time. 

Cornelius Agrippa (born in i486) was the 
first promoter of occult science. He came of 
a noble family of Cologne, received the best 
education of his time, was a man of varied 
attainments, great inconsistency in conduct, 
and a caustic Humor which everywhere made 
him enemies and prevented him from having 
any settled abode. He wandered from place 
to place, sometimes honored with the favor 
of the nobility, and sometimes plunged into 
extreme misery. He early became a secre- 
tary in the court of Emperor Maximilian I., 
and under that monarch distinguished him- 
self in the army by such bravery as to win 
his spurs as a knight. Soon disgusted with 
the profession of arms, he devoted himself to 
law and medicine, but his intemperate pen 
soon drew him into quarrels and persecution. 
At Dole he fell out with the monks; at Paris 
and Turin he compromised himself with the 



is; at Metz he incurred the animos- 
ity of the Jacobins for attacking the pn 
ing opinion that St. Ann had three husbands. 
1 le becao ibond and almost a b&lt; 

■rmany. England, ami Switzerland, and 
then went to Lyons, where the mother of 
Francis 1, who was then Queen R&lt; 
made him her physician. He soon lost tavor 
here, and was disgraced and banished; then 
he went to the Low Countries, where he was 
imprisoned on account of his treatise on 
"The Vanity of the Sciences." Afterward 
he returned to Lyons, was imprisoned anew 
for an old libel against his former patron, 
and finally died in the hospital of Grenoble 
in 1535 at the age of about 50. His tr 
on ''The Vanity of the Sciences" made him 
most trouble and showed best both his bit- 
terness of spirit and the extent of his learning. 
Herein he laid down the paradox, which was 
later renewed and sustained by Ron- 
that there is nothing more pernicious and in- 
jurious to common life, or more pestilential 
to the salvation of souls, than the arts and 
sciences. He founded this thesis on Scrip- 
tural authority and supported it by profane] 
testimony. 

The conclusions which Agrippa drew wer 
not so strange to the eyes of his contempoi 
ries as they are to ours. Long before him, 
men of character and attainments, such a$ 
Pic de la Mirandola and Bessarion, had at- 
tempted to introduce the Platonic idea, thai 
the best means of acquiring science and trutL 
were introspective. They were, moreover 
persuaded that a great number of phenol 
ena and events have their origin in astra 
influences. From this system to the extra) 
gance of the Cabal* is but a step; indee«|

speculative system of Hebrew origin, which rlou 
ished from the tenth to the sixteenth century, 
included a mystic theosophy and cosmogonv, 
tributing to deity neither will, desire, nor 
but teaching that from it emanated wisdom, grac 
intellect, power, beauty, firmnos, and &lt;&gt;th&lt; 
butes. It also ascribed hidden meanings to tr 
sacred Hebrew writings and words. Ev&lt; n in 
letters and forms of the sacred words the folloi 
of the Cabal pretended to find wonderful and 
den meanings; hence the modern expression 'Vi 
istic." The teachings of the Cabal were esoter 
of course, and inculcated mysticism and o&lt; 
in everything, but appear to have been more 
less influenced by Neoplatonism.

the Christian doctrine that events and phe- 
nomena are influenced by the direct inter- 
vention of the deity or of the devil, is but a 
small transposition. The Cabalistic theory, 
summed up, was that all the events of life 
and all the phenomena of nature proceed 
from influences which gods, devils, or the 
stars exercised on the "archetype" — that is, 
on the essential spirit or substance. He who 
could withdraw his spirit possessed supernat- 
ural faculties. The day and the hour of 
birth, according to this view, were under the 
domination of particular stars, and each of 
the principal members of the body was 
supposed to correspond with some planet or 
constellation. This is the fundamental idea 
underlying the pictures — which are still to be 
'found on almanacs used by quack-medicine 
[firms — of the individual whose interior is so 
completely and uncomfortably exposed, while 
around him are arranged the signs of the 
zodiac with indications as to which part of 
the body is governed by each. 

Occult Philosophy, built upon this founda- 
tion, was divided into four branches: The- 
\osophy, to which a man raised himself by 
[prayer; Magic, or the art of controlling de- 
jmons; Astrology, or the art of reading future 
events by the stars; and Alchemy, which 
(teaches the secret of extracting the essence 
or the archetype of substances, i. e. virtually 
the secret of the philosopher's stone, by which 
ymetals were to be transmuted and then abol- 
ished. 

And so the errors of science, the preju- 
dices of the superstitious, the excitement of 
the religious, and the cupidity of the rich and 
powerful, all concurred to propagate the faults 
Df the Cabal at the close of the Middle Ages. 
Never were there seen so many sorcerers, 
istroiogists, and alchemists; never were 
Drophecies, visions and prodigies so com- 
mon. Whatever happened, it was pretended 
i.hat it had been announced by some previous 
;ign, or that it was a revelation of the future. 
This particular kind of folly persisted in Ger- 
nany longer than in any other part of the 
vorld. Even Martin Luther seemed to share 
nany of the cabalistic views, and his alleged 
truggle with the devil, his adventure with 
Jhe inkstand, and so on, contributed much to 
pread them, and were perhaps the most 
prominent illustrations of their general 



acceptance. Surely these were the Dark 
Ages. 

Jerome Cardan was born at Pavia in 1501. 
His life, like that of Agrippa, was one of 
vicissitude and inconsistency. Being the 
idol of his mother and the detestation of his 
father produced a peculiar effect upon his 
character. When he began to study he made 
rapid progress, and at the age of 22 was able 
to discuss publicly all questions. About two 
years later he received his doctor's hat. He 
practiced medicine in various places until he 
was 33, and was then made professor of 
mathematics at Milan. He occupied this 
position but two years, then traveled in Ger- 
many, France, and England, and returning 
to Italy was imprisoned for debt in Bologna, 
and finally obtained a pension from the Pope 
in Rome, where he died in 1556. He was a 
man of great attainments and sagacity; his 
literary style was dignified, and if he had not 
developed such a taste for the marvellous, 
such inconceivable credulity and superstition, 
and such vanity and boasting, he would have 
been a remarkable character in his age. 
Leibnitz said of him; "Notwithstanding his 
faults, Cardan was a great man and, without 
his defects, would have been incomparable." 
He wrote extensively on philosophy, mathe- 
matics, and medicine. Sometimes he ad- 
mitted to his writings the most absurd state- 
ments of visions, etc., and again affirmed 
that he had never devoted himself to cabal- 
istic art, blamed those who practiced it, and 
jeered at those who believed in it. He wrote 
extensively on chiromancy. For his own 
follies and misfortunes he apologized, at- 
tributing them all to influences of the stars. 

The most colossal figure in this collection 
of mediaeval charlatans and knaves was 
Paracelsus. He was born in 1493, near 
Zurich, of a well-to-do family, his father be 
ing a physician. He had a good preliminary 
education, and then visited the various uni- 
versities, or rather university towns; but in- 
stead of listening to the professors, Paracelsus 
associated with clever women, barbers, magi- 
cians, alchemists, and the like, from whom he 
acquired much information. He was led at 
once to the vagaries of the Cabal, and, ac- 
cording to his own statement, did not open a 
book for ten years. He neglected his studies 
and forgot his Latin, so that he became inca-

A* this time Paracelsus was between 33 
and . and at apparently the 

St brilliant period of his life. He had 
written extensively ami with emphasis of his 
numerous cures, after the fashion of charla- 
tans of those days — and, unfortunately, of 
to-day. — and claimed to be possessed of in- 
fallible secrets against the most intractable 
diseases. He had just been called to Basle 
to the chair of physic and surgery, and 
crowds of curious and idle persons attended 
his lectures, which he gave in the vernacular, 
and not, as was customary in those days, in 
Latin. In order to strike his auditors with 
astonishment, he began by burning the works 
of Galen and Avicenna, and then reading 
from his own writings, breaking off from time 
to time into the statement: "Know, ye doc- 
tors, that my hat knows more than you; that 
my beard is more experienced than your 
academies. Greeks, Latins, Arabians, French, 
Italians, Jews, Christians, and Mohammedans, 
you must follow me; I shall not follow you, 
for I am your monarch, and sovereignty be- 
longs to me." As may be imagined, his pro- 
fessorship was not one of long duration, and 
he soon had few or no listeners. In conse- 
quence of some mishaps he left Basle quite 
precipitately, his departure causing no such 
sensation as his arrival. He then resumed 
his nomadic life, and we find him at Alsace 
in 152S, at Nuremberg in 1529, at St. Galle in 
1531, at Mindelheim in 1540, and the follow- 
ing year at Salzburg, where he died in the 
hospital at the age of 48. 

Few men there are of whom so much g 
and so much evil has been written as of Para- 
celsus. Few are there of whom it is to-day 
so hard to judge, since if we refer to his 
contemporaries they disagreed completely 
concerning him, and if we refer to his own 
writings we fall into still greater chaos and 



to abandon the attempt. His Writing*

ance, dissipation, and boasting — a school of[

Thessalus of Tralles had been the Corypheus, 
in antiquity, which John of Gaddesden re- 
vived in the Middle Ages, and to which Para- 
celsus gave a new development." 

While, as has been briefly recounted, the 
partisans of the occult sciences strove to 
completely overturn the scientific edifice of 
antiquity, other reformers more sensible and 
less daring were content to expose its de-i 
fects without attacking it in its entirety.' 
These were for the most part enlightened 
men and at the same time free thinkers, 
friends of progress and not of destruction. 
During the sixteenth century these men were 
few in number, but at least three or four of 
them deserve mention. 

John Argentier was born in Piedmont, and 
taught in Naples, Pisa, and Turin. He did 
not hesitate to take issue with the theories 
and statements of Galen, and criticised those 
who adopted them too servilely. Of him it 
may be said that, although styled a reformer.

nevertheless he kept too near to the doctrines 
of those against whom he inveighed to seri- 
ously weaken their position. 

Leonard Botal, also a Piedmontese, was 
born in 1530. First a surgeon in the French 
army, he later became physician to the kings 
Charles IX. and Henri III. He was the first 
to recommend frequent and general blood- 
letting. Apparently before his time this 
practice was greatly restrained. He carried 
his views so far as to maintain that an infirm 
old man should be bled from two to six times 
a year, and that it was good custom to open 
the veins of healthy individuals every six 
months. He wrote a remarkable memoir on 
the cure of disease by blood-letting. It is 
not to be denied that he obtained some re- 
markable success with his copious venesec- 
tions, and it must be said in his defense that 
if he overdid it his contemporaries did not 
resort to it often enough, and that his own 
practices were instructive to others. In his 
writings he united independence and energy 
of thought with elegance and purity of style. 

Joubert (1529-83) was chancellor in the 
University of Montpellier and physician to 
King Henri III. He wrote a treatise on 
" Popular Errors," which had an unheard-of 
success. In less than six months there were 
sold nearly five thousand copies, which, con- 
sidering the times, constituted a prodigious 
edition. For one thing, it was written in the 
common tongue, and so placed within the 
reach of all. It was also diversified with 
anecdotes and jokes, some of which were not 
of the most delicate character; in fact, the 
author endeavored to atone for some of its 
salacity by dedicating it to Queen Margue- 
rite. He really proposed for his main pur- 
pose a serious and useful one, namely, that of 
combating prejudices which were both injuri- 
ous and ridiculous. Although we may make 
light of Joubert's treatise, it certainly achieved 
a useful end by dissipating a multitude of 
errors, giving information to those who could 
scarcely get it as well from any other source. 
That it was full of defects is simply another 
form of saying that it was published in the 
middle of the sixteenth century. 

It was during this period of which we have 
written that the separation of the priesthood 
from medicine was completed. From the 
sixteenth century celibacy was not obligatory 



on physicians in the kingdom of France, and 
they no longer enjoyed ecclesiastical bene- 
fices. At this time, too, surgery, which had 
naturally been separated from medicine, be- 
gan to approach it, the combination thus 
gradually brought about inuring to the benefit 
of all concerned. From now on, the profes- 
sors of St. Come were on the same level as 
the professors of the university, and enjoyed 
equal privileges. Institutions for instruction 
in medicine increased, and those which al- 
ready existed were developed. Amphithe- 
atres for dissection were open in every city 
in Europe. Hospitals and dispensaries were 
established alongside the schools, and by the 
various governments more attention was paid 
to the protection of the public from imposi- 
tion and to the amelioration of every evil 
affecting either public or private health.

COOPERATIVE MEDICINE, OR LODGE 
PRACTICE.* 

BY DOCTOR JAMES SAMSON. 

This paper is simply a few plain, cold- 
blooded observations in reference to a malig- 
nant pustule that has during the present 
generation planted itself on the body of the 
medical profession, with results such as al- 
ways follow the history of malignancy. 

The medical profession has long enjoyed 
the dignity of standing in the very forefront 
of respectability among the educational or 
ganizations of the world; and it has, we all 
believe, honestly deserved this recognition — 
first, from the high standard of its attain- 
ments; second, from the tremendous interests 
involved in its pursuits; and lastly, from the 
fidelity and honorable energy with which its 
disciples have in all modern days dedicated 
their best energies to the duties of their 
chosen vocation. And all of this dignity has 
been but an accumulation of the individual 
worth of the members of the profession. 
That this condition of affairs shall always 
continue, is a " consummation devoutly to 
be wished," both for ourselves and in the 
interests of those whose destinies are largely 
in our hands. So literally is this true, 
that no wiser injunction could be impressed

that his dignity and self-respect will win him 
half the ind DSefnlness lie shall ever

he goes w:!! ever respect him most who m 

- himself. And so I believe that he 
who peddles his profession pi it, and 

pays for his crime the inevitable price that 
prostitution has always paid, both in his own 
personal humiliation and in the degradation 
that his debauchery brings on the craft which 
he represents. 

It was no honorable motive that first in- 
spired the damnable heresy of cooperative 
medicine, nor has any one ever claimed that 
it was even a humane impulse that fathered 
this ill-begotten innovation. Almost every 
so-called benevolent organization known 
among the sons of men in our day had a 
bastard birth, and under the hypocritical 
guise of Christian charity was chartered and 
founded to fill some man's pockets or the 
measure of his ambition. And as all men in 
their average daily conduct seem so prone to 
value their money more than their lives, the 
audacious scheme was concocted of offering 
them the bonus of gratuitous medical attend- 
ance as a special inducement among all the 
others. And so the profession that has always 
done and always will do, to the very verge 
of eternity, more for charity's sake than all 
others, was asked to add a halo of respecta- 
bility to this scheme of modern philanthropy, 
to accept all men as paupers, to care for them 
in sickness and distress at the ordinary rate 
paid by all other corporations for all other 
paupers — a rate which, by the way, has 
always been considerably less than the aver- 
age horse-breeder would gladly pay a veter- 
inary surgeon for the care of as many average 
horses. 

And so doctors in hundreds and thousands, 
with a strange fascination for that which 
promises money on the spot, have taken the 
thirty pieces of silver and made themselves 
part and parcel of the scheme. Some enlisted 
because poverty suggested the crime, some 
because of the promise of a possible inroad 
into homes to which they might otherwise 
for a long time and perhaps forever remain 
strangers. Artifice was thus employed as an 
accession to brains. Some enlisted from an 



"true 
inwardness" and inevitable tendency of the 

ill-shapen B and some from that 1

And es on, and the man who pos- 

- houses and lands and stocks in the 
bank, and a m trtgage on the physi&lt; 
home, can command his .services and &lt; laim 
his professional bondage for a year, for the 
same money he would pay a dog-healer for 
the inspection of a hound with the mange. 
And the hireling going from door to dooi 
gathering mites from the rich and the 
no greater often than the umbrella-mender 
gets, and with more feeling of contempt for 
himself than his fellow-practitioners have for 
him, slowly and quietly ousts the old famili 
physician out of the home and little by little 
makes of him an enemy. Or he sees the sicl 
man recover, and himself dismissed with 
little ceremony as a beggar, and the da] 
after sees another carriage at the door an&lt; 
another doctor caring for the family, and his 
own humiliation increased. Or he finds thai 
the man who pays like a pauper commands| 
like a king, and wants as much attention paidj 
to a carbuncle as would be given to a garri- 
son poisoned with cholera. And he comes,' 
and he comes again and again, and goes into 
the house half-sneaking, and comes out of it 
cursing the contract that gave him a pittanc 
to put himself under obligations and be a 
slave to an unreasonable hog. And then h&lt; 
himself is sick of it all, and knows as he liv&lt; 
that there is no enjoyment or satisfactioi 
and but little present or prospective profit ii 
it, that there never was one righteous reasor 
why he should have enlisted in the work, anc 
that the entire system is a crime against th&lt; 
dignity and harmony and prosperity of tl 
profession. And when the patient is reall] 
sick, and growing sicker every hour, tl 
prospect of a consultation with the famil 
physician convinces him that here is a situa- 
tion which no schedule of lodge fees ev&lt; 
yet fully provided for. And when the gn

edition of their versions of the cause of 
death, and the annual meeting of the lodge 
has come around again and a " put up" vote 
has put another physician in charge, it is 
then that he (the doctor I have been writing 
of) goes to his home in the dark and swears 
that Scugog Lodge No. 784 will see his 
face no more forever — he swears it alone, 
where none may hear and wonder whether 
his motives were manly or mercenary when 
he first stood at the door of Scugog 784 
praying so earnestly for admission to all its 
rites and ceremonies. 

I need not linger long on the moral of it 
all. That man is now, and ever was and 
ever will be, the best member of any profes- 
sion, who himself most highly esteems his 
membership. The physician who has learned 
to place a low estimate on the value of his 
services will learn sooner or later that no one 
else's estimate is higher than his own. Char- 
ity should be charity, pure and simple and 
undefiled, and all else should be business and 
business only. His most steadfast and abid- 
ing friends will be those whom he has won by 
the most dignified, most manly, and most 
skillful display of his real worth; and his own 
individual pride in his profession, and his 
personal standing among his fellows, will 
some day appear to him as they really are, 
matters of intense importance.

This is often a most distressing symptom, 
and in rare instances becomes, when pro- 
longed, threatening and even dangerous. 

In a recent number of Vratch, Tatevosoff 
calls attention to common tobacco-snuff as a 
remedy. He narrates the case of a patient 
suffering from chronic chest-disease, accom- 
panied by violent attacks of cough, invari- 
ably succeeded by paroxysms of most ob- 
stinate hiccough. After a time the singultus 
refused to yield to any of the classic reme- 
dies—even cocaine was powerless. Then 
tobacco-snuff was employed in successive 
pinches until lively sneezing was induced. 
The result was most satisfactory, for with the 
first sternutation the singultus disappeared, 
to return no more.

SERPENT POISON AND POISONING. 

The action of serpent venom when intro- 
duced into the circulation is exceedingly 
swift. First occurs an intense burning pain 
in the part lacerated, succeeded by nausea, 
retching, coldness, vomiting, numbness, faint- 
ness, and collapse; the surrounding parts are 
discolored by livid blotches as the result of 
extensive blood-disorganization — not by co- 
agulation, as is generally surmised, for the 
blood is now deprived of its fibrin, the prin- 
ciple upon which coagulation depends, — dis- 
solving, attenuating, and altering the form of 
the red corpuscles, the integrity of which is 
life; causing them to adhere one to an- 
other and to the walls of their conduits. 
Second, the poison is conveyed to the brain, 
overloading its capillaries, inducing paralysis 
of those organs that derive power from the 
great nerve-centres. It is not to be supposed, 
however, that all or even a major portion of 
the blood-disks require to be decomposed to 
ensure fatality, since death commonly super- 
venes long before such consummation can be 
realized. It is the capillary circulation that 
suffers most, the very size and calibre of the 
trunk vessels affording them comparative im- 
munity. The agglutination of disintegrated 
and decomposed blood-corpuscles, impeding 
circulation, produces the peculiar livid blush 
with its attendant swelling, a similar condi- 
tion being induced also within the brain and 
spinal cord. 

Heart failure, and paralysis of the muscles 
of respiration through reflex influence of the 
par-vagus and great sympathetic nerves, are

• phenomena, and afford in- 
dubitable evidence of brain pressure; br&lt; 

thereby retarded and made laborious, 
and pulm n impeded. The 

heart to the lungs fails 

to receive the supply i - iry to 

&gt;nization, hence is returned cha 

with effete prodc brain, already 

►ubly poisoned by 

the superadded uneliminated carbon, and 

. train of symptoms that, com- 
mencing with drowsii stupor 
that gradually becomes more and more pro- 
found, terminating solution. 

Though so frequently attended with dire 
results, wounds inflicted by venomous reptiles 
are not invariably fatal — hence the many 
"positive cures." There are seasons and 
periods when all such creatures are compar- 
atively innocuous. The venom may have 
been diluted or exhausted by repeated at- 
tempts to obtain food; it may have been ex- 
truded ere the fangs were buried in the flesh, 
or absorbed by the clothing during passage 
through it. Woolens are efficient safeguards, 
and the fang-teeth, so fragile in their con- 
nection with the jaw, are frequently torn 
out by becoming fixed in the cloth. Again, 
some individuals are more susceptible than 
others, owing to varied causes, and a few 
possess temporary or permanent immunity 
that may be either natural or acquired. Re- 
covery from one or more inoculations wherein 
all the virulence of the species has been 
manifested is popularly believed to afford 
ample safeguard against the poison in the 
future: this, however, is a somewhat mooted 
question. 

To seek a specific for poisons of this class 
is as irrational as the pursuit of the " philoso- 
pher's stone." Nostrums innumerable have 
been vaunted and widely heralded, only to be 
relegated to oblivion; and it is difficult to 
name any substance so inert or so filthily 
nauseous that it has not had its praises as an 
antidote sung at one time or another. "One 
swallow does not make a summer," and the 
history of the world affords ample evidence 
that coincidences are far more frequent than 
demonstrations. 

Serpent venom is instantaneous in its ac- 
tion and swift to accomplish all its deadly 
work, consequently cannot be overtaken 



and Overcome by any ordinary remedy, even 

though the latter be introduced directly into 
the circulation — much less when admin 

I by th( h, when from twenty to 

thirty minutes are required for absorption. 
it can reach the blood-corpuscles and 
nerve centres, both ,. ^ve 

such as may be afforded through eliminative 
and recuperative process* Mature. An 

antidote, moreover, presupposes a substance I 
that will restore the form, functions and ener- I 
gies of the red corpuscles; which would place I 
man in the p of one of the greatest I 

attributes of his Creator— the power to pro- 
duce life anew! 

Iodine and its preparations, and potassium 
permanganate, constitute the nearest ap- I 
proach to specifics that, without encroaching | 
upon the divine and supernatural, can be I 
looked for; thrown into the wound and circu- Jj 
lation, they have the power to arrest decom- I 
position and favor adhesive inflammation, (j 
whereby lymph is effused and coagulated, re- I 
tarding absorption. Other measures availa- . . 
ble are: 

Prompt cutting-off of circulation in the jj 
part affected: 

Removal of unabsorbed venom from the 
wound by the lips or cupping-glass: 

Direct mechanical stimulation of heart and 
lung action, sustaining life until Nature shall 
have had opportunity to eliminate the poison, 
which may occur through any or all excre- 
tory functions — fortunately the economy is 
provided with innumerable sentinels (absorb- fl 
ents) ever on the alert to seize upon effete jj 
and noxious products and place them in the 
way of elimination. 

So long as heart and lungs act, death, is 
impossible. Alcoholic and other diffusible 
stimulants, digitalis, strychnine, etc., are of 
value only as they act mechanically in sus- 
taining and supporting fleeting circulation 
and respiration; they in no way modify the 
action or virulence of the poison; and an 
intoxicated person, far from enjoying the im- 
munity popularly imagined, succumbs more 
readily than one in full possession of his 
faculties.

heart and respiration. On one occasion a 
syce (horse-keeper) in his employ was bitten 
by a cobra of unusual size and virulence. 
Though the man was more than half-stupid, 
delirious, and already looked upon as dead 
by relatives and friends, his hands were 
bound to the back of the doctor's gig and he 
was forced to keep up with the pace of the 
horse (some eight or nine miles an hour) 
through a circuit of thirty miles. When re- 
leased, though bathed from head to foot in 
profuse perspiration, and half-killed with 
fatigue, all evidences of his misfortune had 
vanished. 

The value of copious cutaneous transpira- 
tion, securing an eliminating channel for the 
rapid discharge of poison, is well understood 
by physiologists, and cannot be too highly 
extolled; in no other way can action be had 
so thorough and prompt. 

The native populations of the Orient, in 
spite of widely prevailing opinions to the 
contrary, are remarkably free from resort to 
nostrums, which appear to be the especial 
prerogative of so-called ''advanced civiliza- 
tion." Knowing the prompt relief to be 
obtained thereby — though with no under- 
standing of the physiological phenomena in- 
volved—the person bitten is seized by his 
friends, and constant and vigorous exercise 
is enforced, even at point of stick; and seem- 
ingly cruel beatings are often necessitated. 

Jugglers, too, far from exhibiting serpents 
that have been rendered innocuous by re- 
moval of fangs, seldom employ any but well 
developed, markedly virile reptiles, the cobra 
being the general favorite because of an 
affectionate, tractable disposition, with no 
tendency to avail it,self of its terrible weapon, 
save only when frightened or enraged; the 
manipulation, however, is always prompt, 
certain, and adroit. Accidents do sometimes 
happen, the remedy for which is instant 
amputation of the wounded part, by means 
of a sharp, broad-bladed knife, which every 
serpent-charmer is provided with, and that is 
carried hidden beneath his girdle. 



MASTURBATION AND THE SCHOOLS. 

Over thirty years ago, when Hermann Cohn 
came forward with the emphatic statement 
that the schools were ruining the eyes of the 



pupils, he was charged with exaggeration. 
Not until after the lapse of a long period, 
and the publication of a large number of 
corroborative reports by other authors, were 
his hygienic propositions accepted and con- 
formed to in the erection of school buildings. 

He chose for the subject of his latest ad- 
dress at the Budapest Congress one of the 
greatest of the evils that beset school chil- 
dren, viz., masturbation. 

Neither the diseases of society nor those 
of the individual can be prevented or cured 
until they are openly discussed, and this is 
the fundamental principle announced by 
Cohn, who handles his theme in a very lucid 
and comprehensive manner. He discusses 
the symptoms and consequences of the evil, 
the question whether it is more injurious 
than coitus, its favoring causes in the schools, 
and, finally, the possibilities of prevention. 

Masturbation is so widespread among the 
youthful that neurologists have been led to 
declare there is not a single living male who 
has not at some time or another sinned in 
this respect. Cohn's observations are cor- 
roborated by Fiirbringer, Curschmann, Moll, 
Fleischmann, Lindner, Kempe, Jacoby, and 
others. It is known that even in nurslings 
onanistic movements may be observed, fol- 
lowed by a stage of excitation similar to 
orgasm. In children over nine months of 
age onanism is quite frequent; and later on, 
boarding-schools, military academies and 
similar institutions become propagators of 
the vice. Among the accruing consequences 
may be enumerated neurasthenia, functional 
sexual derangement, psychic sexual disease, 
and eye-maladies. 

With respect to the evil consequences of 
this habit as compared with those resulting 
from coitus, Cohn reaches the conclusion 
that moderate masturbation in persons of 
sexual maturity is, as a rule, no more in- 
jurious than a like degree of sexual inter- 
course; if, however, onanism is begun at an 
early age and practiced daily for years, last- 
ing injury may be, and usually is, inflicted 
on the physical and mental powers — injury 
which fluctuates in severity according to the 
constitution and resistant vitality of the in- 
dividual. 

It is an error to suppose that youthful 
onanists cannot be singled out. The habit

practical abandonment of the recess interval 
in many schools of the United States is also 
a potent factor, since it inhibits an amount of 
desirable relaxation and healthy exerc 

With respect to preventive measures, it is 
suggested; 

That during instruction, as well as in the 
intervals, the teacher make it his business to 
see that masturbation is not practiced recip- 
rocally between pupils; 

The teacher is also in duty bound to ap- 
prise the pupils of the danger of both self- 
masturbation and mutual onanism: 

Also, through lectures and printed matter, 
the parents and guardians should be ad- 
monished to fulfill their duty by warning 
their children of the dangers of onanism. — 
The question of immunity from punishment 
of all informers, as suggested by Cohn, is a 
problem to be considered. 

The need of alertness on the part of the 
teacher is patent, but it is not recommended 
that culprits when discovered be exposed in 
open class and lectured regarding the dangers 
of the vice; this is a matter that should be 
settled entirely in private, the offender being 
made to realize the disgraceful character of 
his habit. The teacher may then, if it seems 
desirable, communicate with the parents. 

Much of the vice is traceable directly to 
the absurd manner in which infants of tender 
age are swathed, the genitals being heated 
and irritated by an excess of clothing. Sore 
vulvae, due to filth, may also act as a cause, 
to say nothing of the turpitude and willful 
misconduct of certain nurses. Lindner may 
be carrying matters too far when he asserts 
that the sucking of the fingers is a symptom 
of masturbation, but it must be conceded 
that onanism is to be frequently observed in 



children p ; this habit, and long before 

they begin to attend school. The m&lt;

onanists enter schdol they, of cours&lt; . 

tinue their practice, but a guilty 
of evil prompts them to conceal the vice 
from parents and attendants at home and 
from associates elsewhere. 

The entire problem is one of great im 
portance, and Cohn has had the coura. 
discuss the evil with perfect freedom. It 
certainly behooves all entrusted with the care 
and rearing of children to use every me 
limiting and preventing this demoralizing and 
dangerous habit; and here knowledge of the 
simplest physiological, dietetic and hygienic 
law&gt; is of paramount importance on tip 
of parents, guardians, and teachers, that they 
may impart the same to the children. Above 
all, steps should be taken in every commu 
nityto repress the objectionable cheap litera 
ture that so generally obtains, most of which, 
if not entitled to designation as pornographic, 
certainly stimulates and disseminates lewd 
ideas. 



EDITORIAL NOTES. 



Syphilis Among the Innuits.— 

It has frequently been stated by Arctic ex- 
plorers that the aborigines of the more north- 
ern portions of the American Continent are 
entirely free from venereal disease— a condi- 
tion that has never been true of the same 
portion of the opposite hemisphere. A 
Danish medical journal recently stated syph- 
ilis has not been observed in Greenland for 
upwards of a hundred and fifty years, al- 
though frequently taken thither by sailors; 
but since 1872 it appeared among the villagers 
of Foighet and Arsuk. However, it would 
seem that northern climes are inimical to the 
spread of the malady, since the fifty cases in 
Greenland in 1872 had narrowed down in 
1889 to only ten, and even these were of 
most benign character. Though the d 
is common to the tribes of Northern Siberia 
and Russia, it seems to be possessed of little 
virulence.

Hysteria and Wedlock.— 

It is a belief as old as Hippocrates that 
hysteria is cured by marriage. 

Our own experience is, that latent and un- 
suspected hysteria often first asserts itself 
after consummation of the nuptial state, and 
that ignorance of sexual laws, and conse- 
quent sexual abuse, tend to induce not only 
hysteria but other neuroses. Doctor W. 
Cook, who has been investigating, corrobo- 
rates that "most cases of dysmenorrhea and 
hysteria among single women are aggravated 
by marriage." 

Digitalis in Pneumonia. — 

Doctor Foster, in an address before the 
Pennsylvania State Medical Society, insists 
that recoveries from pneumonia will and do 
occur in greater numbers when the malady 
is treated by large and persistent doses of 
Digitalis. In conjunction with strychnine 
given in physiological doses, normal liquid 
Digitalis is administered until the pulse comes 
down to ninety per minute. If it can be 
kept there, recovery will ensue in a shorter 
time than by any other method of treatment. 

Pessimistic— 

The Western Doctor, announcing that a new 
homoeopathic journal has entered the field, 
adds: "It will die. Medical journals are 
going to have 'hard times' during the next 
two years, and many will go to the wall; and 
deservedly." 

This prophecy, however, does not seem to 
have had any dispiriting effect; since it was 
made, four more new journals have announced 
themselves, and one aims to be a daily. 

Corneal Abscess.— 

Hansel recommends treatment by instilla- 
tion of a solution of Physostigmine sulphate, 
one grain to the ounce. He declares that in 
several instances, after the usual remedies, 
such as atropine, hot water, and tonics, had 
been employed without benefit, improvement 
began within twenty-four hours after the in- 
stillation of the Pnysostigmine, and contin- 
ued to prompt healing; no other change was 
made in the treatment. 

Suggestive.— 

Of the thirty-seven recent applicants for 
positions as assistant surgeons in the United 
States Army, but five were found qualified; 



of thirty applicants for like positions in the 
United States Navy, only three were found 
qualified. 

It would appear as if there was something 
radioally wrong in the system of education 
carried on in the majority of colleges, when 
barely sixteen per cent, of the graduates are 
capable of meeting the demands for military 
and naval service. 

Cremation.— 

This is certainly the coming method of 
disposing of the dead. In a few years it will 
have largely displaced the present burial sys- 
tem. It is cleanly, economical, and devoid 
of all the objectionable features that pertain 
to inhumation. This being admitted, why 
should it not in all cities and larger towns 
replace the scandalous and dreary waste that 
attaches to every cemetery under the guise 
of "potters' field"? 

Time to Begin Weeding Out.— 

Doctor W. B. Mead, of Oberlin, Kansas, 
expresses the opinion, in a recent number of 
the Medical Brief ", that the time for a "civil 
service reform" in medicine has arrived; that 
only the fittest can survive. He justly adds 
that in the future only men who have re- 
ceived an academic or classical education 
should be allowed to present themselves as 
students of medicine. 

Remedies that Cure.— 

This is the very pleasing title of a book, 
recently published in France. We are of the 
opinion, however, that the somewhat portly 
volume that would result from an attempt to 
describe the remedies that do not cure would 
be of much greater therapeutic value. 

Palatability and Dosage.— 

Gelatin capsules afford an absolute means 
of securing palatable dosage. The smaller 
are readily taken by the youngest children, 
and their advantages in administering qui- 
nine and nauseous drugs cannot be over- 
estimated. 

Infant Foods.— 

Doctor Davis, of the Polyclinic Hospital, 
New York, declares the worst cases of mal- 
nutrition in infants he has ever encountered 
were those in which the children were fed 
permanently on condensed milk.

for human beings, there is a feeling th

calomel " the following mixtures are sold at 
prices in accordance with the composition: 
Calomel one part, white lead three parts: 
Calomel one part, white lead seven parts: 
Calomel one part, flaxseed meal one part: 
Calomel three parts, white lead two parts: 
Calomel one part, sugar one part. 

This vividly brings to mind the fact that a 
number of years ago "horse antimony" was 
the only black sulphuret of antimony procur- 
able in bulk in the Chicago drug market, and 
the "antimony" in this was represented by 
ground anthracite and mica. — Medical Stand- 
ard. 

A Strange Disease in Dublin.— 

A number of the inmates of the Richmond 
Insane Asylum at Dublin have been attacked 
with a disease resembling beriberi in many 
of its features. The symptoms are a general 
cedema, beginning in the legs and spreading 
thence to the whole body, followed by per- 
ipheral neuritis and paralysis. There is no 
fever, and albumen has been found in the 
urine in a few cases only. The heart is weak, 
and dyspnoea is complained of. After a 
while the cedema diminishes and signs of 
neuritis appear; then ataxic symptoms stt in, 
with loss of the patellar reflex and muscular 
atrophy of the extremities. Post-mortem 
examination has shown hydropericarditis, 
cedema of the lungs, ascites, and fatty de- 
generation of heart and kidneys. Over a 
hundred have been attacked with the malady.

An Inconsistency.— 

If specific bacteria can live peacefully in 
normal secretions, without producing the 
pathology with which they have been so inti- 
mately associated in the minds of their dis- 
coverers, they are in no sense pathogenic. 
Why ? Because it is claimed that they, through 
their life processes, produce toxins, which, in 
turn, cause disease. But these life processes

go on continuously in normal secretions, and 
yet produce no bad symptoms. 

The only satisfactory explanation of this 
inconsistency is, that bacteria simply feed 
upon the organic debris found in greater or 
less degree in all secretions, and do not in- 
vade the tissues until necrosis sets in. — Med- 
ical Brief. 

Absurd Legislation.— 

The Journal of the American Medical Asso- 
ciation, in speaking of the annual meeting of 
the Pennsylvania State Dairymen, clearly 
shows the absurdity of the legislation against 
oleomargarine. The editor of the Meadville 
Messenger, Mr. A. J. Palm, obtained three 
packages of "imitation butter," which he ex- 
hibited as butter and gave the names of three 
of his dairyman friends as exhibitors. As a 
result of this trick, the one-pound package of 
imitation received second premium, and a 
third premium was awarded on the five- 
pound package, which scored one point 
higher than the best dairy butter in one- 
pound packages — Maryland Medical Journal. 

Gonorrhoea and Old Age. — 

Gonorrhoea is generally considered a dis- 
ease of youth or middle life, and there would 
appear to be the best of reasons why the old 
age of man should be exempt from it. But here 
comes an account from New York of a case 
in a man 103 years old. The disease was de- 
cidedly acute, and, although particulars are 
not given, there is every reason to believe it 
was acquired in the usual way. As many 
cases of this disease have lately been reported 
in children of tender years, and even in in- 
fants, it is evidently futile to try to set an 
age limit for it. — Northwestern Lancet. 

To Make Steel Instruments Bright as New.— 

Clean by rubbing with wood ashes and soft 
water. Then soak in a weak solution of hy- 
drochloric acid in water (about ten to fifteen 
drops to the fluidounce) for a few hours, to 
remove the remaining rust and grease. Wash 
well in pure soft water, and place in a bath 
consisting of a saturated solution of tin chlor- 
ide, letting them remain there ten to twenty- 
four hours, according to the coating desired. 
When removed from the bath, wash clean in 
pure water, and dry well. When the job is 
well done, the steel will appear as if nickel- 
plated. — New York Medical Times. 

The Evil of Proprietary Medicines.— 

Especially reprehensible is a habit which 
threatens to become more and more general 
— I mean prescribing proprietary medicines, 



particularly those that contain narcotics. By 
doing so the physician not only jeopards the 
physical and moral future of his patients who 
buy these vile compounds indefinitely, think- 
ing they have struck the right remedy, but he 
helps to develop a branch of pharmacal in- 
dustry which constitutes a crying evil. — 
Ludwig Bremer, in Medical Fortnightly. 

Convallaria. — 

Doctor Manuel Bustamente highly praises 
this drug, and likewise its alkaloid, in valvu- 
lar diseases of the heart with increased venous 
and diminished arterial tension. He notes, 
however, that it, and the alkaloid especially, 
may give rise to haemoptysis, dyspnoea, and 
other disagreeable symptoms. He concludes 
that the drug appears to have a better action 
than digitalis and caffeine, and frequently 
succeeds where these fail.— -Deutsche Medi- 
zinal Zeitung. 

A Paradise for Superannuated Horses.— 

We note from the British Medical Journal 
that the horses which furnish antitoxin sup- 
plies suffer no pain from the inoculation, but 
"are fatter, sleeker, and in better condition in 
every way than they were at the outset." 

It is gratifying to hear this. Truly the 
diphtheritic poison does not produce this 
happy result in our patients, but there is a 
vast difference between a genuine malady 
and a scientific experiment. 

Pulverized Camphor. — 

Dissolve camphor in one and a-half parts 
of alcohol; precipitate by the addition of four 
parts of water. Collect the precipitate, wash 
with an abundance of water, and dry. This 
will not conglomerate. By keeping account 
of the quantity of camphor used, the quantity 
left in the diluted alcohol can be calculated, 
and this solution used for making tincture, 
etc. — Der Phar?naceut. 

A Good Move. — 

The Iowa Legislature has a bill before it 
requiring every proprietary medicine to have 
printed upon its wrapper a statement of the 
ingredients contained therein. Failure to do 
so subjects the manufacturer to a fine of 
$100, or six months in the penitentiary. —

A somewhat similar bill is pending in the 
Michigan Legislature.

PleurisN Root in Pneumonia.— 

Doctor ('has. Churd, in the Medical Cen- 

tury % declares pneumonia, if seen duru . 
first twenty-four hours of the disease 
almost invariably be aborted by Asc 
tuberosa. The editor of the Century believes 
the renudy to be efficient in all stages of the 
malady. 

.Mushrooms and Toadstools.— 

The Western Druggist says, to distinguish 
these "without eating and waiting for re- 
sults," peel an onion and put it in with the 
fungi while they are being cooked. If the 
onion remains white, you may eat with con- 
fidence; if it turns black, there is death in 
the pot. 

Worth Remembering.— 

P .ysicians who dispense their own reme- 
dies — and there are few who do not carry a 
small pocket-case — will find it greatly to 
their professional advantage to carry a small 
supply of gelatin capsules in order to enclose 
the tablets, powders, or pellets they choose 
to prescribe. — Exchange.

Is This True?— 

It is reported that Aronson is working with 
a firm of chemists that are seeking to patent 
antitoxin; also that Roux and Behring are 
seeking patents. 

It is to be hoped] this rumor is without 
foundation. 

Some Do Need It.— 

It is an open secret that St. Louis will soon 
have another medical school for the benefit 
of practitioners of medicine. This puts us in 
mind of the surgeon who suggested steriliz- 
ing his antiseptics. — Columbus Medical Jour-

Therapeutic Brevities, 



Jambul in Diabetes. — I have had no result 
at all with the powdered preparations of 
Jambul in diabetes, and in fact gave up the 
use of the drug altogether until Messrs. 
Parke, Davis &amp; Co. put their fluid extract on 
the market, and this I have given, more or 
less, to all my patients suffering from dia- 
betes, with excellent results. 

While I do not claim Jambul to be a spe- 
cific, I do believe the fluid extract of the 
seeds is the best and most reliable agent 
known for the purpose of arresting the dia- 
betic process. It has been my custom to 
give it ir&gt; five-minim doses four times a day 
for a couple of weeks; three-minim doses for 
the next two weeks; then to gradually run it 
up to ten minims for the succeeding fort- 
night; then gradually reducing so as to come 
to a full stop at the end of the sixth week. 
Meantime I note carefully day by day the 
specific gravity and other conditions of the 
urine. If sugar reappears, the drug is re- 
sorted to again and pushed until this patho- 
logical feature is eliminated. 

While Jambul may not permanently relieve 
diabetes, it certainly takes away the excessive 
nervous symptoms, the feeling of uneasiness, 
and allows the patient to go about his daily 
labor with ease and comfort, to say nothing 
of being able to sit at the table and eat mod- 
erately of what is preferred — in fact, the pa- 
tient once more feels like a human being and 
not like an animal condemned to bran-mashes 
and other tasteless and unsatisfactory messes,

is employed: this consists in including the 
sutured margins of the peritoneum in every 
second suture of the abdominal wall. 



Omental Hernia. — A new method for the 

adical cure of large omental hernise has been 

levised by Gersung (Centralblatt fur Chirur- 

-ie). After making the necessary incision, 

he sac is freed on every side by blunt dissec- 

ion, then opened, the omentum ligated, and 

he stumps with any coils of intestine re- 

urned; the sac is then cut off, and the peri- 

Dneum sutured on a level with the bottom of 

he wound. The median borders of the 

scti muscles are then opened with scissors, 

ie peritoneum sutured, and next the abdom- 

lal wound is sutured — entering the needle 

uite near the margin to prevent inversion of 

ie skin; as the needle reaches the muscle a 

reater thickness is taken in order to bring 

ie margins together, when the sutures are 

ed, or the edges may overlap. To prevent 

ie formation of a pocket, Billroth's method 



Caulophyllum. — A good remedy in conges- 
tive dysmenorrhcea, and also in the spasmodic 
type, from whatever cause, is Blue Cohosh. It 
is indicated when there is heaviness, dragging, 
fullness in the hypogastric region, scanty 
flow with expulsive pains, and sympathetic 
pain in the rectum and bladder. In threat- 
ened abortion with spasmodic pain it is an 
almost specific. In labor with rigid os and 
vagina it is a valuable remedy, correcting the 
condition quickly, especially if frequently 
given with small doses of lobelia or gelse- 
mium. In rheumatism of an acute form, 
especially if affecting the smaller joints, it 
may supersede other remedies, and it is an 
ingredient of all the old alteratives. Its most 
marked influence, however, is upon the mus- 
cular structure of the female reproductive 
organs. One drop of the fluid extract at a 
dose, frequently repeated, or larger doses if 
required. — Medical Stanaard. 



Apocynum Cannabinum as a Heart Tonic. — 
Doctor Glinski declares this drug is an active 
cardiac tonic. Being himself affected with 
hypertrophy of the left ventricle, with dilata- 
tion, mitral murmur, etc., he took fifteen 
drops of fluid extract daily in three doses, 
with the result of complete amelioration of 
all functional symptoms. Further trials in 
other cases of compensatory troubles met 
with like success. He further declares that 
Apocynum cannabinum, while being similar in 
action to digitalis, is altogether free from the 
cumulative action of the latter drug. No 
secondary effects have ever been observed 
other than augmentation of arterial pulsa- 
tions. In dilatation of the heart it diminishes 
the area of dullness, increases the secretion 
of urine, allays palpitation, and favors secre- 
tion. — Jourfial des Practiciens. 



Ox-Gall in Typhoid. — Bile is a normal phys- 
iological antiseptic: 

And an antipyretic: 

Also a tonic to the heart, decreasing the 
number of beats, but increasing the force of 
the individual beat; in other words, producing 
a rise in the blood-pressure up to a certain 
extent: 

It produces increased contraction of the 
muscular structure of the intestine: 

Diarrhoea, meteorism, hemorrhage, are not 
contra-indications to its use:

.. — An exhaustive in- 
q looking to the effect of Quinine 
salt during gestation has brought forth the 
following conclusions: The existence of preg- 
ar to the administration of the 
drug; in fevers and other affections during 
pregn mcy the effects of Quinine are more 
marked than at any other time; abortion fol- 
lowing the administration of the drug is the 
result either of the original malady or of 
idiosyncrasy — allowing for idiosyncrasy in 
in which a tendency to abortion exists, 
and in others, as a matter of precaution 
Quinine is best administered with a seda- 
tive, such as opium. The old, staid view of 
the action of Quinine on the duration of 
pregnancy is not borne out in any degree by 
clinical experience. — Medical Progress. 



Physiological Action of Ethyl Bromide. — 
The studies of Dastre have proven that 
Bromide of Etjiyl is adapted for use in the 
human subject, the narcosis induced being 
similar to that of chloroform — both act on 
the brain, then on the medulla, and lastly on 
the bulb. Chloroform chemically irritates 
each centre before paralyzing it; Bromide of 
Ethyl acts directly, there being consequently 
no excitement and no laryngeal reflex to be 
feared. Still more, it is a vaso-dilator; it 
produces congestion of the head, and thus no 
syncope is to be feared; at the same time, 
this permits of the sitting posture of the 
patient, so necessary in certain operations on 
the throat. — Doctor C. G. Cvmston, in 
Boston Medical and Surgical Journal. 



ility in Fractures.— M. Bumm is an ad- 
vocate of very moderate motion in fracture 
treatment, claiming that hasty immobiliza- 
tion often leads to unpleasant results, while, 
on the contrary, early massage and joint ac- 
tion, with gymnastics, favor restoration of 
muscular strength, articular motion, and con- 
solidation of the callus. 

He believes in massage throughout treat- 
ment. When the point of fracture is close to 
the joint, he allows the dressings to remain 
undisturbed until the tenth or twelfth day, or 
a longer time with oblique fracture through 
the humerus or femur. — Le Progres Afe'dical.

Treatment of Bubo. — M. I.aub has reported 
a series of cases of bubo, which he has 
treated with great succe-s by W'elander's 
method. This consists in, first, makin. 
eral narrow, deep punctures and evacuating 
the pus, then injecting deeply a 1:1000 solu- 
tion of nitrate of silver through each punc-j 
ture, after which a compress and bandage are 
applied. Reaction is moderate, intlamma-i 
tion ceases, and in about ten days cure is 
complete. — Berliner Klinische lVochenschrift. { 



Asafoetida for Insomnia. — A five- grain pil 
of Asafoetida, exhibited after supper and r&lt; 
peated at bed-time, will often bring refresl 
ing sleep. In mild delirium, and especiall 
during the period of unrest that precedes 
attack of delirium tremens, the injection, 
rectum, of two ounces of mixture of Aj 
fcetida will, in many cases, produce tl 
much-needed sleep, without recourse to tl 
more dangerous narcotics. — Louisville Media 
Monthly. 



Chronic Eczema. — In eczema of long stai 
ing, where the parts are much thickened 
infiltrated, Doctor Cantrell advises: 

Salicylic acid. 20 grains. 

Green soap, 15 ^r.iins. 

Oil of cade, 15 minims.

Mastitis. — Doctor J. T. Hall recommends 
for the prevention of mastitis and the relief 
of engorged and painful breasts, one drop of 
tincture of Aconite and ten grains of Potas- 
sium Acetate every four hours. He declares 
that in more than one hundred cases the rem- 
edy has never once failed. — Medical Times. 



Magnesium Sulphate for Burns. — Doctor 
N. F. Howard, in a case of extensive and 
painful burns of the hands, obtained almost 
instant relief by immersing for one hour in a 
solution of one pound of Epsom Salt in two 
quarts of water. A dressing of lime-water 
and oil was then applied and the raw parts 
covered with oxide of zinc. — Atlanta Medical 
and Surgical Journal. 



Application for Warts. — The following is 
recommended by L' Union Medicate: 

Concentrated acetic acid, 10 parts. 
Precipitated sulphur, 20 parts. 
Glycerin, 50 parts. 

These are to be thoroughly mixed, and the 
warts painted therewith daily until they be-

Chorea. — Put the patient to bed, regulate 
he diet carefully, prohibit all stimulants in- 
cluding tea and coffee, and give Fowler's 
solution in ascending doses to the point of 
deration. In addition it is well to accustom 
he patient to a series of systematic exercises 
uch as will tend to give control of cooordi- 
late movements. — Doctor J. M. Taylor. 



Oleum Gynocardice. — This is largely recom- 
lended as an anti-rheumatic, employed both 
xternally and internally. It is best given in 
"om one- to five-minim doses, in cod-liver 
il, until nausea makes its appearance, when 

may be withdrawn, to be resumed a little 
iter. It is even claimed to be specific in 
3me forms of leprosy. — The Summary. 



Passiflora Incarnata. — For great nervous 
ccitement and restlessness I give a half-tea- 
)oonful dose of tincture Passiflora incarnata 



every three hours. After the second dose, if 
there is no evidence of sleep, I double the dose 
both as to time and to frequency, thereby se- 
curing the desired effect. — Doctor Merson, 
in Homoeopathic News. 



Dysmenorrhcea. — For twenty years I have 
used Sanguinaria exclusively in the treatment 
of painful menstruation. I commence two 
weeks before the expected return of the 
menses, and give a teaspoonful dose three 
times a day and a teaspoonful on going to 
bed. — Doctor J. M. Hall, in Chicago Medical 
Times. 



Chronic Cough and Chronic Bronchitis. —

Spirits of chloroform, 2 drachms. 
Dilute hydrobromic acid, 3 drachms. 
Tincture squill, 45 minims.

A dessertspoonful every three hours. 



Bryonia. — One of the most interesting 
therapeutic resuscitations is that of Bryonia. 
Employed by Galen in practically the same 
states as to-day, it was later associated with 
homoeopathy and fell more or less into dis- 
use, but is once more regaining professional 
favor. — Exchange. 



"Specifics" in Diphtheria. — According to 
Doctor A. Campbell White, of New York, any 
remedy which will prolong the life of the pa- 
tient with diphtheria beyond the thirteenth 
day has carried him beyond the danger of 
death and may be called a specific. 



Sourwood in Anasarca. — A writer in the 
Chicago Medical Times declares that an ex- 
tract made from the leaves of Oxydendron 
arboreum is most effective in general anasarca. 
The dose at first is small, but must be gradu- 
ally increased as it can be borne. 



Cocillana in Bronchitis. — It is said that front 
five to twenty-five minims of the fluid extract 
of Cocillana given in chronic bronchitis se- 
cures expectorant effects without depression, 
and at the same time helps to improve the 
appetite. — Southern Clinic. 



Asthma. — Euphorbia is advised as an excel- 
lent remedy in the management of those forms 
of this malady in which there is an absence of 
organic change. — Exchange. 






THE M K.niCAL AGE. 



Medical Progress, 



Thi Treatment 01 [ntbstin 
riON. — Physicians and Burgeons are still far 

from precise indications for 

surgical intervention u : intestinal ob- 

struction. The physicians, on the one hand, 
point to numerous recoveries from the most 
plights obtained, or, at any rate, 
facilitated, by purely medical means, while 

the surgeons attribute the comparatively 

mortality which follows operations 
undertaken for the relief of this condition to 

the fact that the patient does not come into 
their hands until medicine has done its 
and the conditions have become SO unfavor- 
able that all the skill in the world must often 
prove ineffectual in averting the fatal termi- 
nation. The subject has come up for discus- 
sion several times during the past few weeks, 
without apparently bringing us any nearer a 
modus vivendi. One variety of intestinal ob- 
struction which has received special attention 
is the comparatively rare form in which the 
obstruction is due to the impaction some- 
where in the intestinal canal of one or more 
gall-stones. Although the idea of surgical 
intervention naturally occurs to one as the 
speediest and most certain plan of affording 
relief in this condition, there are numerous 
instances on record in which persons appar- 
ently on the verge of dissolution have unex- 
pectedly recovered, the calculus having at 
last succeeded in finding its way past the seat 
of obstruction. As it can only in very excep- 
tional cases be possible to diagnose the exact 
nature of the condition previous to operation, 
the question of the treatment of this precise 
lesion does not often suggest itself either to 
the physician or the surgeon, the latter only 
being enabled to ascertain the nature of the 
obstruction when he has cut into the abdo- 
men. In any event, cases of death from im- 
pacted gall-stones are so rare that many 
surgeons in active practice have never met 
with a single example, and the various 
museums attached to our medical schools 
contain few, if any, pathological specimens 
illustrating the morbid appearances. 

Statistics appear to teach us that surgical 
intervention in desperate cases holds out very 
little hope of a successful issue, and until 
cases have become surgically desperate phy- 
sician and patient alike are loath to abandon 
the usual measures in favor of the laparoto- 
my's knife. A dispassionate review of such 
statistics as are at present available seems to 
justify the assertion that less lives would be 
lost by strict adherence to medical treatment 
to the bitter end, than would be saved by 



early surgical intervention. Undoubtedly 

the majoi I intestinal obsti

tment, and the complications whl( 

so frequently present in th

Moreover, as a matter of fact, the question

towns which are fortunate enough to p 
Surgeons with the experience and the courag&lt; 
to undertake such operations with a re 
able prospect of a successful issue. In tl 
country, public opinion would not sancti(

tioners, whatever their individual profit 
would hesitate to incur the responsibility 
advising or performing such operatio; 

\ gall-stone in the intestines is a troubh 
some guest. Even when it does not forth- 
with bring about a crisis, it is apt to set u\ 
attacks of intestinal obstruction from time t&lt; 
time, either by becoming impacted in the 
ileo-caecal valve or by causing spasmodic 
contraction of the irritated walls, or, 
two cases recently published by Mr. Ma] 
Robson, by determining volvulus. Case- 
such as these are of necessity only amenable 
to surgery, and when this is not obtainable 
must end fatally. Even when the surgeoi 
discovers the nature of the obstructing bod] 
the question remains, what ought he to de 
with it? Should he try to push it along the 
canal until it has cleared the ileo-caecal valve 
should he endeavor to break it into pieces bj 
needling through the coats of the irritatee 
intestine; or is he justified in incising the gi 
and removing the stone through the aper- 
ture? When it can be forced or c&lt; 
through the valve it would appear to be tol- 
erably safe to leave to Nature the task of 
expulsion, but when it comes to choosinj 
between needling and removal through ar 
incision ad hoc few surgeons would h&lt; 
to prefer the latter, recent advances in inte 
tinal surgery enabling this to be done. with- 
out adding materially to the patient's risk]

entiate the poisoning resulting from opium, 
arsenic, atropine, or strychnine. 

We have all grades of infectious diseases, 
from the mild to the malignant, depending 
upon the temperament and constitution of 
the patient. And these poisons manifest 
their presence in various pathological ways, 
depending upon their affinity for certain por- 
tions of the organism, just as drug poisons 
do. 

Bacteria are but incidental features. If 
we prepare a solution of strychnine and leave 
it exposed to the air, it will soon contain 
bacteria. But if we now inject this solution 
into an animal, we will still &amp;et the character- 
istic phenomena of strychnine poisoning. 
Inoculations of bacteria may infect by con- 
veying into the system a sufficient quantity 
of a poison to cause reaction. A very small 
amount of any of the poisonous alkaloids 
produces their typical effects. 

All poisons affect the channels of elimina- 
tion and the nervous system. In the infec- 
tious diseases, nephritis, diarrhoeas, pneu- 
monia, bronchitis, skin eruptions and nervous 
disturbances are frequent and distressing 
complications. 

In cases of drug poisoning, we look to 
elimination and chemical and physiological 
antidotes for relief. In the infectious dis- 
eases, similar measures will yield most bene- 
fit. As we do not know the chemical com- 
position of these poisons, we cannot provide 
an accurate chemical antidote, but we do 
know that drugs containing a large amount 
of oxygen in loose combination exercise a 
very favorable influence over all vegetable 
and animal poisons. These drugs are the 
antiseptics and should be given freely. The 
emunctories should be stimulated, especially 
the skin, and nervous symptoms combated by 
^physiological antidotes when they threaten 
to shock the pitient too severely. 

Poisons break down the blood-corpuscles 
'very rapidly, possibly by abstracting oxygen; 
and clinically the iron salts, such as the tinc- 
ture of the chloride in combination with 
chlorate of potassium, mercury and other 
drugs, which increase the formation of blood- 
corpuscles, exert a beneficial influence. — 
Doctor J. J. Lawrence, in Medical Brief .

hat he is inviting disaster by jeopardizing

urge him to pause, and to ponder well, 
whether, despite this warning, he dare take 
such risk. Let him not be blinded by any 
underestimate of the poppy's power to en- 
snare. Let him not be deluded by an over- 
confidence in his own strength to resist; for 
along this line history has repeated itself 
with sorrowful frequency, and — as my experi- 
ence will well attest — on these two treacher- 
ous rocks hundreds of promising lives have 
gone awreck. . . . 

I have no wish to pose as an alarmist, but 
I will say that many a doctor who gives him- 
self a daily hypodermatic dose of morphine 
for a fortnight will come perilously close to 
the danger line — beyoud which, bondage be- 
gins. . . . 

Regarding the over-use of morphine, never 
was there so little excuse for it as now, for 
never were the means at command to ease 
pain and bring sleep equal to those of to-day. 
Modern medicine is richly equipped in this 
regard, and if these resources be fully availed 
of it will go far to decrease this ill. . . . 

Teachers in medical schools should realize 
that they have opportunity to wield great in- 
fluence for good, and by word and deed they 
should improve it. To do so would strike 
right at the root of this evil, for I truly think 
the junior members of the profession are the 
greatest sinners in this regard; and if, by 
timely counsel from their preceptors and col- 
lege instructors, the thousands who year after 
year begin a medical career can be brought 
to believe the danger incident to an incau- 
tious or needless giving of morphine, and then 
shape their practice in keeping with that be- 
lief, the good work will be largely done. . . . 

More and more the older medical men, 
impelled by larger wisdom, or an experience 
often unhappy, are quitting the syringe; more 
and more rarely are they using morphine. — 
Doctor J B. Mattison, in "Morphinism in 
Medical Men." 



Cancer of the Kidney. — A man, aged 
thirty-nine, had for six or seven years been 
subject to recurrent attacks of hematuria, at 
first only a few times yearly, but during the 
last three years oftener. The attacks came 
on independently of exertion or any other 
cause, and were not, as a rule, preceded or 
followed by pain. Between the attacks the 
urine was normal, but latterly showed a trace 
of albumen. Only once, a few years ago, had 
he passed a small stone, the size of a pin's 
head. No tenesmus, not even during the at- 
tacks. Three years ago a hardening began 
to be felt under the right costal margin, which 
gradually increased until a year ago, when it

began to develop more rapidly. The tumor 

tender, but examination has some- 
times caused slight pain. As the attacks of 
hematuria became more frequent the pa- 
tie] l h Buffered. The tumor, 
which could be felt midway between the i 

tal margin and Poupart's ligament, was hard, 

round, the size ol a man's fist, fr&lt; 

movable, and could be pushed up so that its 

upper part disappeared under the costal mar- 
gin; its surface was somewhat uneven, and 
the ascending colon ran obliqui SS it. 

N phrectomy was performed, as the left kid- 
ney wa&gt; found normal and no metast. 
were detected in the peritoneal ( avity. The 
patient made an uninterrupted recovery. 
On examination the tumor was found to be 
• a primary carcinoma. That the ha-maturia 
from the first, six or seven years ago, was 
caused by the malignant new growth, I be- 
lieve, for the following reasons: There had 
never been any symptoms of stone or disease 
of the bladder: All the symptoms pointed 
to the kidney being the cause of the bleed- 
ing: Only once a very small stone had 
passed, but too small and smooth to cause 
lKematuria: In the extirpated kidney no 
concretion was found, and in the left none 
could be felt. Although cases of haematuria 
occur in cases where on laparotomy nothing 
pathological can be detected, is it rash to 
conclude when, as in this case, a malignant 
tumor appears after a few years' time, that 
this has been the cause of the haematuria 
from the first? — Medical and Surgical Re- 
porter. 



Heart Syphilis. — Syphilis of the heart is 
a comparatively rare affection, the anatomical 
changes of which usually commence in the 
myocardium and thence extend to the endo- 
cardium and pericardium. They consist in 
the formation of the specific infectious gran- 
ulation tissue in the form of a reddish-gray 
infiltration, that develops principally around 
the smaller vessels, whence it proliferates 
into the connective-tissue interstices between 
the muscle bundles and muscle fibres. The 
granulation tissue may grow and form com- 
pact circumscribed masses, which after a 
while change to typical gummata, attaining 
perhaps the size of a hazelnut or even of a 
walnut. In other cases the connective-tissue 
formation will be more abundant, and an in- 
terstitial gummatous myocarditis will form. 
In still other cases cardiosclerosis may re- 
sult; or, finally, an endocarditis syphilitica 
Gummatous pericarditis and endocarditis are 
not infrequently present after the disease has 
lasted for some time. 



The clinical symptoms ol heart syphilis are 
DOt pronounced, and the affection is mostly 
found in the tertiary stag&lt; Si ?erc d -

and are by no means characteristic. The &gt; 

is irregular or rhythmic, or there may be in- 
termission.^; the patient suiters from palpita- 
tion, shortness of breath, and an oppressive 

feeling, or may apparently be entirely well 

when suddenly a severe attack of heart failure 
sets in. that may result in death. In other 
death results after symptoms of chronic 
insufficiency of the heart. Sometimi 
symptoms may disappear completely and the 
patient be apparently cured. The diag 
is not easy, and in making it the history of a 
syphilis at any time of the patient's life must 
always be taken into consideration. An earlj 
diagnosis is of the greatest importance, since 
it gives us the only indication for a si: 
ful treatment with specifics. — .SV. PetenburgA 
Medicinische Woehenschrift. 



Tablet Triturates. — Tablet triturate? 
are certainly "convenient and elegant." but 
as prepared, I think they are at times fai 
from being "safe and accurate." 

I have carefully examined samples fronr 
several different manufacturers in variou; 
States and find the same objection to all 
namely, that the ingredients are not tritu 
rated but simply mixed. This might do ver} 
well where the medicines are of a harmles; 
nature, although by no means commendable 
but when tablets containing arsenic, strych 
nine and the like are so carelessly made tha 
you can dig out the various combination: 
with a sharp-pointed knife under the nakec 
eye, I think it is time to cry halt. 

In my humble opinion all mixtures ough 
to be ground and triturated so that thi 
finished tablet should exhibit one uniforn 
color throughout the whole, and the individ 
ual drugs should not be distinguishable evei 
under a moderate magnifying glass. Onh 
such can be safe. — "A Country Doctor,'

Crises of Disease. — Acute diseases conn 
to the crisis in fourteen days; the fourth dai 
is the indicator of the seventh; the eighth i: 
the commencement of the second week. Th« 
eleventh day should likewise be attended to 
for it is the fourth of the second week; w&lt; 
should, also, remark the seventeenth day, fo 
it is the fourth from the fourteenth and th&lt; 
seventh from the eleventh. — Medical Brief.

TYPHOID=MALARIAL REMITTENT FEVER. 

BY DOCTOR JOAO VINCENTE TORRES HOMEM.* 

Malarial infection often manifests itself by 
a pyrexia of more or less frankly remittent 
type, accompanied by symptoms very analo- 
gous to those of typhoid fever, in the first or 
second week simulating them perfectly, and 
giving rise to errors of diagnosis. A practi- 
tioner who has not been accustomed to ob- 
serve the diseases of the sub-tropics may be 
easily deceived, especially if in doubt re- 
garding the patient's history. 

Before 1873 I verv rarely observed a case 
of genuine typhoid fever (ileo-typhus), while 
I met with many examples of the pyretologi- 
cal species in question — mainly in the Miz- 
ericordia Hospital. These examples, which 
were multiplied in other hospitals, as well as 
in private practice, gave me a satisfactory 
explanation of the opinion of several col- 
leagues, and very distinguished ones, who 
believed that abdominal typhus was not rare 
and that it yielded in a few days to quinine. 

The similarity of the symptoms of the two 
pyrexias is such that, the patient being seen 
for the first time after the third day of the 
disease, if the physician is deprived of the 
aid of extraneous history, it is only a posteriori 
— that is, after the use of quinine — that the 
diagnosis can be definitely established. It 
was doubtless an acquaintance with facts of 
this kind that led Germain See (in a series 
of clinical lectures upon the value of ther- 
mometry in the diagnosis of acute febrile 
diseases, published in the Gazette des Hopitaux 
de Paris) to express himself as follows: 

There is nothing more difficult than the di- 
agnosis of typhoid fever in its commencement,

Navy. 



especially in malarial countries, and yet there 
are few questions in practical medicine of 
more importance. 

As I shall show a little farther on, in the 
differential diagnosis of these doubtful cases 
the thermometer, consulted in the first forty- 
eight hours, becomes a great resource. Some 
cases of typhoid seen in Rio de Janeiro begin 
with a well marked intermittent fever, con- 
tracted or not in localities surrounded by 
marshes, which gradually becomes remittent 
until its nature is completely transformed; 
the history of the case, then, should not 
always inspire confidence, since more than 
once it has led me from the path of truth. 

Doctor Griesinger describes a grave form 
of remittent fever* which is very analogous to 
the typhoid-malarial remittent fever of Rio 
de Janeiro, — this appellation, which I am ac- 
customed to use, indicates the type of the 
pyrexia, its nature, and the symptomatic form 
it assumes; while the celebrated Berlin pro- 
fessor ranges under the denomination of 
" grave forms of remittent fever" not only 
the species forming the heading of this paper, 
but also the bilious remittent fever of the trop- 
ics, or hemorrhagic bilious fever, which has 
deservedly obtained from all pyretologists, 
as well as from those who occupy themselves 
with the diseases of tropical climates, a 
special and minute description. 

Typhoid-malarial remittent fever was of 
old observed on a large scale, assuming a 
more or less grave character, and receiving 
the name of typhoid pernicious fever. 

From reading the work of Doctor Sigaudf 
as well as the excellent monograph of Baron 
de Lavradio,J it is easily'deducible not only

that • rexia wai frequent, but also that 

in some instances it was entirely confounded 
with the dothen-enteritis (typhus abdonn- 
nalis) of Bretonnc 

In the aetiology of the nosological sp&lt; 
I am treating of, the influence of the malarial 
miasm is evident; the course which the dis- 
the diso - digest &gt;n, the 
□ o\ the liver and spleen manifest 
in all the case^ the promptness with which 
all the .symptoms yield to quinine, demon- 
strate this influence superabundantly. But 
the frank typhoid form assumed by the 
pyrexia very different from the recognized 

and varied forms of the pernicious fev&lt; 
the typhous element which dominates the 
whole array of symptoms, leads me to be- 
that, besides the malarial miasm, an- 
other cause is acting upon the patient's 
system, another infection altering his blood- 
this other cause can only be the 
miasm of animal origin which produces gen- 
uine typhoid fever and the various species of 
typhus observed in practice. From the com- 
bined action of these two morbigenic prin- 
ciples, typhoid-malarial remittent fever origin- 
ates; just as yellow lever also originates if 
certain topographical and meteorological 
conditions are concurrent; just as genuine 
typhoid fever too originates, with well marked 
intermittent paroxysms at the outset of the 
disease, midway in its regular course, or on 
its termination, as is very common in marshy 
countries. If mixed miasmatic poisoning 
(vegeto-animal) produces a pyrexia of ma- 
larial basis and of typhoid form, it is because 
the malarial miasm predominates over the 
typhous; in the contrary case, the disease 
developed is a form of typhoid fever having 
merely the symptomatic form of an intermit- 
tent fever, characterized by well marked 
paroxysms, ordinarily quotidian, supervening 
at various periods of the principal affection, 
and not exerting the slightest influence on 
its progress or termination. If the patient 
dies, in the first case, whatever may have 
been the symptoms observed, whatever its 
gravity, the autopsy does not reveal the 
presence of the intestinal lesions which ana- 
tomically characterize abdominal typhus; it 
discloses only the splenic and hepatic changes 
which are so frequent in acute malarial 
poisoning. In the second case, how 



regular may have been the paroxysms, how- 
ever deficient the typhoid symptomatology, 
necropsy shows us the true nature of the dis- 
the anatomo- pathological phenomena 
of ileo-typhus are patent m the small intes- 
tines. 

\s regards the therapeutics, in the firm 

• be patient red .vers in a I . after 

taking quinine (Case- :\\(\ 3); in the 

second, despite the methodical and pro' 

of this drug, despite the energy with 
which it has been administered, th&lt; 

Oxysms keep on approximating on. 
the fever takes on the continued type, pur- 
SUes its onward course, and the symptoms 
characterizing typhoid fever beconn 
and more accentuated, until there can nq 
longer exist any doubt about the diag I 
ses 4 and 5). 

In a certain number of cases the- typhoid 
form assumed by the malarial infection de- 
pends upon the condition of impoverishment 
and wretchedness under which labors the 
system of the person who is acted on by the 
effluvia of the marshes. A diet insufficient 
in quality and quantity; living in a dark, Iow.« 
damp and ill-ventilated room where the at- 
mosphere is confined; bodily fatigue from ex^ 
cessive labor; lowering of morale by profound 
chagrin and other depressing passions, — such 
are the circumstances which favor the appear- 
ance of typhoid symptoms in malarial fevers 
as in any other acute febrile affection. 

The pyrexia under consideration almost 
always commences with the remittent type 
without any preceding periodical attacks 
exceptionally these latter are observed, whet 
the patient has not made use of suitable treat 
ment — in spite of suffering he continues tct 
work, exposed to rain, dampness, the sun 1 
without regard to the laws of hygiene; anc 
this is notable in the persons who frequent 
the wards of the Mizericordia Hospital, the 
majority of whom are poor laborers Oil 
wretched slaves. Whether with prodromata 
or without, the disease ordinarily begins witr 
a severe and prolonged chill, or with frequen 1 
shivering-fits, which grow weaker with a sen 
sation of heat in the face. Frontal headache 
appears, prostration of strength, rheumatoi&lt; 
pains in the lower limbs, and fever. In th&lt; 
first twenty-four hours the febrile tempera 
ture reaches 103° or even 104 at the perioc

of exacerbation, to diminish a degree or two 
during remission; this remission almost al- 
ways occurs from 3 o'clock in the morning 
to 10 or 11 a.m., and the maximum exacer- 
bation takes place from 5 p.m. to midnight. 
The pulse, usually strong and full, keeps 
pace in frequency with the variations of the 
thermometer; with the maximum tempera- 
ture it beats no to 120 times per minute, 
with the minimum 90 to 100. The tongue 
becomes furred and dry in the centre, red at 
the tip and edges; in the cases where the 
bilious element is added to the typhoid 
(bilious typhoid fever of Griesinger) the 
coating is of a deep yellow. The dryness of 
the tongue is a symptom that manifests itself 
very early (from the second to the third day). 
There is slight thirst, complete anorexia, 
constipation, rarely bilious diarrhoea; great 
sensitiveness in epigastrium and right hypo- 
chondrium, excited particularly by palpation 
and percussion; liver increased in size, espe- 
cially in its upper limits, in cases with bilious 
complication. Some jaundice is noted. The 
spleen is ordinarily of normal size during the 
first three days of the disease, a little enlarged 
from the fourth day on. Moderate abdominal 
tympanites in some cases (the graver ones), 
[no tympanites in others; pain in iliac regions 
tin a small number of patients, but very rarely 
Himited exclusively to the right; gurgling in 
1 liac fossae in almost all, sometimes only on 
:he right, sometimes on both sides. Urine 
Scanty, red, concentrated, free from albumen; 
i[ observed albuminuria in only one case, little 
narked, and disappearing at the end of 
wenty-four hours, after the operation of a 
aline purgative. 

1 With these symptoms, pertaining to many 

Jorts of malarial fever, are combined others 

pecial to typhoid fever. The patient's face 

'akes on from the beginning an expression of 

jtupidity and apathy; lying upon his back, 

iie patient with difficulty moves in bed and 

nswers the questions addressed to him; he 

an only sit up in bed when supported by two 

ersons, for he feels extremely prostrated. 

udamina are observed upon the cutaneous 

urface, and at times petechia spots, when 

nere is a haemorrhagic tendency, as is not 

jncommon; I only once met with the rose- 

ilar typhoid eruption, so significant in the 

iagnosis of typhoid fever. 



Epistaxis sometimes appears in the first 
three days. In the respiratory organs we 
notice the sounds proper to bronchial catarrh. 
Capillary bronchitis, or even lobar pneu- 
monia, occasionally supervenes and aggra- 
vates the patient's condition. In the first 
few days subdelirium, insomnia and restless- 
ness appear during the night; if the disease 
goes beyond the first week, other grave symp- 
toms declare themselves in the nervous sys- 
tem, such as coma, somnolence, convulsive 
tremor of the upper limbs and tongue, car- 
phologia, and subsultus tendinum. I observed 
enterorrhagia in three cases, and in one the 
loss of blood by the intestines was so great 
that it required the use of astringents in the 
form of pill and enema; all the patients re- 
covered, notwithstanding so alarming a symp- 
tom. In another, a sailor by occupation, an 
obstinate stomatorrhagia occurred, which 
yielded only to the perchloride of iron. 

The fact deserves special mention that I 
never observed vomiting in typhoid-malarial 
remittent fever, even when the bilious com- 
plication appeared. I have recorded fifty- 
eight cases of this nosological species, col- 
lected in the hospitals from 1866 to 1874, 
and in none of them was vomiting reported 
as a symptom. 

In a certain number of cases, especially of 
those which last the longest, parotitis devel- 
ops at the end of the disease; this is a serious 
complication if suppuration of the gland can- 
not be prevented. In one patient who recov- 
ered in twelve days, a phlegmon of the right 
gluteal region appeared at the beginning of 
convalescence, and terminated by suppura-' 
tion. 

Whether it commences by well marked 
intermittent paroxysms, or assumes the re- 
mittent type from the very outset, the disease 
has a short duration; in the great majority 
of cases it runs its course in from seven to 
fourteen days; often convalescence is estab- 
lished immediately after the first week, if the 
patient is observed from the beginning of the 
illness and appropriate treatment is at once 
instituted and persevered in with the requi- 
site energy. It is very common to observe 
during convalescence the appearance of peri- 
odical attacks of quotidian type; in some 
these paroxysms are characterized by the 
three stages; in others, the greater number,

the initial chill is lacking; in others, finally, 
the paroxysm is only revealed by sw&lt; 

eral or partial, which manifest themselves 

at eight or early morning and are regarded 

by the nurses as the expression of the conva- 

ei l '- weakness 

When typhoid-malarial remittent fever ter- 
minates by rec&lt; - is the general rule, 
the remission becomes more marked and the 
evening fever lessens; the first symptoms to 

disappear under the action of a good dose of 

quinine are, the stupor of face, the general 
prostration of strength, the dryness of the 
tongue, and the delirium at night. Little by 
little the typhoid symptoms are dissipated; 
then the congestion of the abdominal vis&lt; 
yields; and it is only at the last that bron- 
chitis ceases, which at times attends the 
patient in convalescence and requires special 
medication. The rapidity with which strength 
and appetite are regained is worthy of note, 
in contrast with what is observed in genuine 
typhoid fever — where convalescences are very 
tardy, lasting at times longer than the disease 
itself. 

In the cases of fatal termination the ady- 
namia progresses; delirium becomes constant; 
the belly is tympanitic — or tympanites in- 
creases if it has previously existed; the tongue 
becomes rough, very red, and pointed; the 
bronchial catarrh assumes great proportions; 
the pulse grows more and more feeble and 
frequent; and the remissions of febrile heat 
keep growing gradually less prominent, and 
hardly a difference of i to 1.5 degrees is per- 
ceived between the morning and the evening 
temperature — the thermometer rises to 104 
and even 106 . Later on, the extremities 
grow cold; the radial pulse reaches 140 or 
more; heat becomes centralized, the ther- 
mometer, applied in the axilla, indicating 
106 and over; coma supervenes; a profuse 
and clammy sweat bathes the skin; and the 
agony, accompanied by oppressed and un- 
easy respiration, or by the tracheal rale, lasts 
for several hours (Cases 6 and 7). 

Of fifty-eight patients with typhoid-mala- 
rial remittent ferer observed in the hospital 
wards, only five died, and of these one had 
suppurative parotitis that brought him to the 
extreme point of marasmus, a profuse and 
obstinate diarrhoea appearing at the last. 
All five cases entered the hospital after the 



third day of the in tw&lt;&gt; there wa

was much lessened in only one of the thre 
cases in which it was a little enlarged. 

In the small intestines, after a minut&lt; 
animation, nothing peculiar to typhoid feve 
was found; there was some injection of mi. 
cous membrane of duodenum, jejunum

normal in all; in only one was the ileo-&lt;

first stage of typhoid. In only one case were 
the mesenteric glands swollen and enlarged, 
and this was in a person whose right lung 
:ontained suppurating tubercles. The kid- 
neys were hypersemic in two cases, fatty in 
:wo, and normal in one. The spine was not 
opened in any of the five cases.* 

I am aware that five autopsies is a very 
nsignificant number for the purpose of draw- 
ng deductions relative to the pathological 
inatomy of a disease, but from what has been 
shown one cannot fail to conclude that 
yphoid-malarial remittent fever is funda- 
oentally different from typhoid proper, and 
hat the lesions producing it in the system 
re the same as those which produce malarial 
wrexias of brief duration. 

As already stated, this form of fever may 
•e confounded with typhoid, especially in its 
utset; even after the first week has elapsed, 
[ the disease has been left to the unaided 
fforts of Nature, or if specific medication 
as not been properly employed, confusion 
etween the two affections is inevitable, 
lowever, a good dose of quinine at the very 
eginning, after properly preparing the chan- 
els of absorption, suffices to assure the diag- 
nosis. At the present day, when all recognize 
lat the salts of quinine are useless and at 
imes harmful in typhoid fever, the question 
f the differential diagnosis between the latter 
Section and another of malarial basis, which 
;ields only to the use of those salts in large 
loses, is assuredly one of great importance — 
|» much the more as by losing the first thirty- 
|x or forty- eight hours the disease is con- 
pually becoming graver, and omission of 
ttecific treatment opportunely administered 
lplies the death of the patient. The physi- 
an ought then to strive to recognize the 
iture of the disorder, questioning to this 
id all the sources of information, the pre- 
ous history, a just appreciation of the 

mptoms, the cause of the morbid phe- 
&gt;mena, and the results of the treatment 
irsued.

r , previous existence of intermittent parox-

&gt;orious part of the post-mortem examination. 



ysms, and coincidence of malarial cachexia, 
are circumstances to be taken into great con- 
sideration in the diagnosis. 

The fact of the tempecature rising above 
103 in the first twenty-four or thirty-six 
hours is of capital importance in favor of 
typhoid-malarial remittent fever, inasmuch as 
from the numerous observations of Professor 
Wunderlich, verified by many German prac- 
titioners, it results that any disease which 
presents a temperature of 104 or over on 
the first or second day is not typhoid; and 
also that it is not a case of this disease if by 
the evening of the fourth day the thermome- 
ter does not reach 103 . I have made the 
diagnosis of typhoid-malarial remittent fever, 
excluding typhoid, in spite of the large num- 
ber of typhoid symptoms presented by the 
patient, only from finding, on the first or 
second day of the disease, the temperature at 
104 or even at 103. 2-103. 6°, as ls tne general 
rule. The thermometer then is a great re- 
source in the differential diagnosis of genuine 
typhoid fever and the pyrexia I am describ- 
ing — a resource the more precious in that it 
is sometimes the only one which inspires us 
with confidence at the beginning, when the 
incidental history entirely fails us. 

Among the symptoms of abdominal typhus, 
some are very rare in typhoid-malarial remit- 
tent fever, notably tympanites, diarrhoea, len- 
ticular spots, and epistaxis. When I say that 
these symptoms are rare, I do not intend to 
offer them as secure sources of differential 
diagnosis, inasmuch as the rarity of a phe- 
nomenon does not imply its complete absence; 
the peculiar rose-spots termed typhoid, and 
regarded by many eminent practitioners as 
characteristic, have once presented them- 
selves to my observation in a case of typhoid- 
malarial remittent, and were seen and ana- 
lyzed by my pupils, some of whom, in spite 
of the positive indications of the thermometer, 
favored the diagnosis of typhoid, contrary to 
that which I had made. The progress of the 
disease, and the results of the treatment estab- 
lished, showed evidently that I was right; 
within ten days the patient had fully recov- 
ered, having taken large doses of quinine. 

It may be seen, then, that the four symp- 
toms which I offer as rare in the disease 
under consideration are auxiliary sources of 
diagnosis, which become of importance when 



106

connected with the history of the case, the 
results of thermometric investigation, and the 
progress of the affection, but which, taken 
separately, have only a partial ami incom- 
plete value. After the rational and method- 
ical use of a dose of quinine, the situation so 
clears up that there rarely can remain the 
least doubt of the diagnosis in the physician's 
mind. Almost always under the action of 
the quinine salt, patients with typhoid- ma- 
larial remittent fever improve greatly in the 
first twenty-four hours; the fever sensibly 
diminishes; the evening exacerbation which 
appears is hardly over half a degree, at most 
under two degrees. Finally, in this fever re- 
covery takes place in the second week, at 
times in the first, while in typhoid, even mild 
typhoid, convalescence begins much later. 

I will say in conclusion that in the diag- 
nosis of typhoid malarial remittent fever the 
physician should pay attention to: First, the 
patient's customary residence, and the locality 
he was in when attacked by the illness: 
Second, whether he has had intermittent par- 
sms, or presents symptoms of malarial 
cachexia: Third, if in the first forty-eight 
hours the temperature reaches 104 , if it ex- 
ceeds or falls below 103 : Fourth, if in the 
array of symptoms there is epistaxis, abdomi- 
nal tympanites, diarrhoea, or lenticular spots: 
Fifth, if, after the first doses of quinine, the 
patient having been well prepared for the 
absorption of this drug, sensible and lasting 
improvement occurs: Sixth, if convalescence 
becomes well marked within the first or 
second week. 

The prognosis of typhoid-malarial remit- 
tent fever is generally favorable. The quicker 
the suitable medication is adopted, the more 
prompt and easy is recovery. Out of fifty- 
eight patients, observed in the hospital dur- 
ing nine years, only five died, and, as already 
stated, of these there was alcoholic cachexia 
in two, pulmonary tuberculosis in one; in all, 
the disease was of over three days' date when 
the patients were received at the hospital — 
one entered after the end of the first week, 
and had been bled copiously when he fell ill. 
Profuse diarrhoea is a very grave symptom, 
and concurs powerfully to a fatal termina- 
tion; of the five deaths, four had diarrhoea. 
Excessive redness of the tongue is also a 
circumstance which aggravates the prognosis, 



not only because it reveals great irritation of^ 1 
the digestive system, but also because it ren- 
ders quinine less effective. 

In the treatment it is essential to attend 
simultaneously to the basis and to the form 
of the disease. Begin by removing every 
disorder which hinders the prompt absorp- 
tion of quinine, such as gastric derangement, 
congestion of the liver or any other organ, 
great intensity of febrile reaction, etc. Ift 
the tongue appears furred, but moist, it is 
proper to give an emetic— ipecac preferably, 
because the patient's prostrated condition: 
contra-indicates the use of antimony. If, 
besides being furred, the tongue is dry, make 
use of the neutral salts, in divided and 
tinued doses, until large dejections appear — j 
I prefer sulphate of magnesia, for its purga-J 
tive action is more promptly manifested. If 
the tongue is dry and red at the tip and 
edges, without presenting the well marked 
furred condition, and if at the same time 
there is constipation (as is the rule), or when 
there is bilious diarrhoea, I resort to calomel,^ 
which is always of great use in the beginning 
of the disease, especially when there is de- 
lirium or when the hepatic congestion is 
very pronounced. 

If the patient presents manifest signs of 
cerebral hyperaemia, such as a great tendency 
to coma from the commencement of the dis- 
ease, with injected conjunctiva, great sensi- 
tiveness to light, intense headache, etc., the 
physician should not hesitate to have recourse 
to blood-letting, by means of leeches, even 
though the patient is prostrated: this should 
be effected at the verge of the anus if the 
disease is still in its first week, at the ma 
processes if it has gone beyond this period— 
for then, the tendency to adynamia being well 
marked, it is proper to draw but little blood. 
and avoid any haemorrhage from the leech- 
bites, and this can be easily done, thanks to 
the bony surfaces upon which effective com- 
pression can be made. 

To combat the hyperemia of the liv 
certain number of wet cups should be ap- 
plied to the right hypochondrium, proportional 
to age, temperament, and other individual 
circumstances of the patient, as well as to: 
the date of the disease. I have never met 
with any indication for general bleeding.

even in robust patients, seen by me in the 
first twenty-four hours of the affection. 

When the febrile heat exceeds 104 , and the 
skin is very dry, neither of the two means I 
have just pointed out being indicated, I make 
use of a febrifuge and diaphoretic mixture as 
follows: 

$ Tincture digitalis, 2 grammes. 
Tincture aconite, 2 grammes. 
Tincture veratrum, 8 drops. 
Syrup, 30 grammes. 
Water, 100 grammes. 

The patient takes this mixture in table- 
spoonful doses every hour; and as soon as 
sweating appears and heat diminishes I give 
the first dose of quinine (one gramme). 

I follow no invariable formula in the use of 
quinine; I either give one gramme of the sul- 
phate dissolved, as soon as the patient is pre- 
pared, and six hours after sixty centigrammes 
more; or I give two grammes in a mixture 
containing opium, in the form of diacodium 
syrup or laudanum; or three doses of sixty 
:entigrammes each, one every three hours; 
md in cases of absolute intolerance of the 
stomach for the remedy, I resort to enemata. 
It is only in cases of very special irritability 
)f the gastric and rectal mucous membrane 
hat I prescribe the quinine salt in pill; on 
iccount of the little confidence I have in the 
[rill form in cases where the patient's strength 
Is reduced, and still more because some time 
igo, when I was called by a distinguished 
•.olleague to see a patient whom he was treat- 
ing for ataxo-adynamic pernicious fever, I 
happened to find seven pills of sulphate of 
minine, perfectly intact, in the stools pro- 
luced by a purgative enema. 
' Besides the quinine salt which constitutes 
he basis of the treatment, and to which I add 
t times the valerianate of the same base, I 
•rescribe for my patients suffering from 
yphoid-malarial remittent fever an antispas- 
modic and stimulant mixture, and correct the 
'yphoid symptoms present. If there is deli- 
ium, I prefer belladonna, hyoscyamus, musk, 
nd cherry-laurel water; if there is great rest- 
issness together with ins®mnia, opium and 
romide of sodium; if there is great adynamia 
nd the pulse is small, weak, and very fre- 
uent, I resort to the ammoniacal prepara- 
ons (carbonate or muriate of ammonia) and 
alerian, sulphuric ether, cinchona, camphor, 



and canella; to these latter remedies, com- 
bined and given alternately with the quinine, 
I am accustomed to add a full-bodied wine. 
The formulae I ordinarily make use of are as 
follows: 

^ Tincture valerian, 2 grammes. 

Tincture cinchona, 2 grammes. 

Sulphuric ether, 2 grammes. 

Syrup orange-peel, 30 grammes. 

Canella-water, 100 grammes. 
One tablespoonful every two hours. 

B Ammonia carbonate, 1 gramme. 
Soft extract cinchona, 4 grammes. 
Simple syrup, 30 grammes. 
Linden-flower water (Hydrolate de 'Tilleal, Fr. 

Pharm.), 60 grammes. 
Balm-water {Hydrolate de Melisse, Fr. Pharm.), 
60 grammes. 
One tablespoonful every two hours. 

1$ Soft extract cinchona, 4 grammes. 

Tincture valerian, 2 grammes. 

Port wine, 100 grammes. 
One tablespoonful every two hours. 

§ Ammonia carbonate, 1 gramme. 

Tincture camphor, 2 grammes. 

Syrup cloves, 30 grammes. 

Valerian-water, 100 grammes. 
One tablespoonful every two hours. 

According to the special indications pres- 
ent, I add the various nervous stimulants, 
graduating the dose to the severity of the 
symptoms I wish to combat. 

In cases where there is delirium or great 
drowsiness I apply blisters to the calves of 
the legs, and prescribe stimulant enemata, as 
powerful derivatives. 

In the use of quinine I follow the same 
method I have advised in the treatment of 
other malarial pyrexias, viz., to maintain the 
first dose for two or three days, diminish 
gradually the subsequent doses, and keep up 
the minimum dose for three days; never sus- 
pend the treatment suddenly, even though 
the patient's improvement betoken speedy 
recovery.

LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF MEDI- 
CINE. 

BY ROSWELL PARK, A.M., M.D.

For a long time the Italian universities 
held the first rank; next came the French,

and iai .erman, although all were well 

attended. The most famous were the d 

cal facultit »logna. Pisa, Padua; then 

Paris, Montpellier, ami finally Basle. 

A little of what concerned the student life 

of this period may not be amiss. The stu- 
dents chose the rector and officers of the 
universities, sometimes even the teachers, 
and assisted in determining the curriculum 
of study, the execution of which they watched. 
In some of the Scotch universities even now 
the students choose the rector. 

The Students were divided, usually accord- 
ing to country, into bodies denominated 
■'tuitions" (some having special seals), which 
were the parents of the present student corps 
in (ierman universities. Certain representa- 
tives, known as vice- rectors, were chosen 
from each of these corps and constituted a 
so-called college of rectors which negotiated 
with the officials of the State, and possessed 
a power that was preserved until the end of 
the sixteenth century. 

The poorer class of students passed from 
one school to another, supporting themselves 
by singing, begging, or stealing, and were 
sometimes guilty of great barbarities. The 
younger scholars, called "Schiitzen," were 
compelled to perform most menial duties for 
their older comrades, the " Bacchanten " — 
much like the system of fagging still in vogue 
in Knglish grammar-schools; and when the 
bacchantes were admitted to the university 
proper they were required to pass through an 
initiation or hazing which eclipsed anything 
known in these days; indeed the antiquity of 
fagging may be traced back even to the phil- 
osophic schools of Athens. The habits of the 
traveling scholars led many of them into dis- 
solute and vicious ways, though some attained 
respectable positions, possibly even eminence. 
The students who were better situated finan- 
cially, for the most part entered the Italian 
universities. 

Already mention has been made of the 
enormous number of students congregated 
during this age in Bologna and in Naples. 
In the small university of Wettenburg there 
were in 1520 only about 600 students; in 
Erfurt 300, and this number dwindled two 
years later to fifteen; in 1500 Leipzig had 
400 students; at the same time there were 
about 7,000 in the University of Vienna. 



Students and teachers migrated from one 

place to another, ami faculties 1 

stantly changing. C.n «• re- 

I with g?&lt; mony. Bitter struj 

and disputes between teachers sometime! 

occurred; it is related of Pistorius, who died 
in 1523, and Pollich, deceased in 1513, that 
they conceived a violent enmity toward 
other because of antagonistic views relative 
to the epidemic or contagious character of 
syphilis, and both ultimately left Leipzig for 
other schools. 

Some curious customs prevailed. In teach- 
ing anatomy, while the learned teachers e\ 
plained the parts as exposed, the dissections 
were left to barbers as being unworthy of an 
educated medical gentleman. While the 
cadavers were mainly the corpses of ex- 
ecuted criminals, it was' thought that before 
and after each special dissection religious 
ceremonies were appropriate, and such were 
often held; it was also believed that all who 
came in contact with such a corpse would be 
made disreputable unless it were itself first 
made reputable; hence the professors first 
read aloud a decree to that effect from the 
magistrate, and then, by order of the senate 
of the faculty, stamped upon the breast of the 
corpse the seal of the university. The body 
was next carried into the anatomical hall, and 
the cover of the box in which it had been 
transported was returned to the executioner, 
who remained at some distance for this pur- 
pose. If the corpse was one that had been 
decapitated, during these solemn ceremonies 
the head was placed between its legs. Finally 
an entertainment with music, often furnished 
by itinerant actors, was given. Hut this folly 
was gradually discontinued, and by the sec- 
ond half of the sixteenth century public dis- 
section was performed without recourse to 
such mummeries. The price of skeletons in 
those days was high; the University of 
Hiedelberg in 1669 paid $72 for one. 

The practitioners of the sixteenth century 
were often quite as roving as the students 
and professors, though those who held posi- 
tions as State physicians were bound by con- 
tract to a fixed residence for a certain time. 
In 15 19 the State physician of Heilbronn 
received a salary of $21 per year and his 
firewood, but could not leave the city over 
night without permission of the burgomaster. 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 



169 



Medical attendants of the King of Spain were 
required to kneel down when they felt the 
King's pulse. There were few physicians 
who acquired wealth, although Fabricius ab 
Aquapendente left a fortune of 200,000 ducats. 

With the approach of the seventeenth cen- 
tury there was evident improvement in both 
the social and mental status of medical men. 
While political humiliation and exhaustion 
were everywhere noted, in the field of litera- 
ture it was evident that the line had ad- 
vanced. What may have been the effect of 
thirty years of religious war, with other 
political struggles carried on under the hypo- 
critical cloak of religion, may be imagined if 
not fully described; the devastation of whole 
countries by disease and notably by the 
plague, the poverty and hunger consequent 
upon the ravages of perpetual war (it is 
stated that even so late as 1792 there were 
still in Saxony 535 wasted and extinct vil- 
lages), to say nothing of the barbarity and 
immorality resulting therefrom — all com- 
bined to make the early part of the seven- 
teenth century a most mournful epoch. It 
is not strange that, with poverty, super- 
stition and great rudeness of manners pre- 
vailed, or that trials for witchcraft and per- 
secutions by the Jesuit Inquisition were 
common. That any advance should have 
been made under such circumstances, speaks 
well for the progress of the human mind. 
That this advance was slight in Germany 
and central Europe is not strange, though 
other countries were able to quietly enlarge 
their scientific borders. Now it was that 
England, Italy, and the Netherlands, which 
took but little part in the warlike struggles 
of the century, acquired leadership in medi- 
cine, and were seconded by the French. In 
Great Britain, science had been fostered by 
various kings, and particularly by Charles II., 
who professed to be something of a chemist; 
in fact an epidemic of scientific interest fell 
upon the English court. 

The seventeenth century, in contrast to 
the idealistic sixteenth, witnessed the advent 
of modern realism in almost all departments 
of thought. Medicine furnished the first ex- 
ample in what we are accustomed to-day to 
speak of as the exact method; hence the cen- 
:ury is of great importance, in that physicists 
ind chemists began to be original instead of 



mere followers of the past. The most notable 
feature of medicine was the promulgation of 
three medical systems: the pietistically col- 
ored Paracelsism of Van Helmont; the chem- 
ical system of Sylvius; and the iatro chemical 
system of the physicist and mechanician 
Borelli. This period is, moreover, illumined 
by the life of one great practitioner, whose 
name will be imperishable in the history of 
our art — namely, Sydenham. 

The principal tendency of the time was 
toward skepticism, which had begun in the 
preceding century with Montaigne, and was 
continued by Charron under the patronage of 
Queen Marguerite of Navarre; it was the 
fundamental idea of Pierre Bayle, the author 
of the great dictionary. Opposed thereto 
was the supernatural philosophy, or the theo- 
sophic, cabalistic, or mystic. The leading 
exponent of the latter was Boehme, who was 
a business colleague of the celebrated " Meis- 
tersinger" Hans Sachs in Germany, and of 
Blaise Pascal and his contemporary Male- 
branche in France. The doctrine of Lord 
Bacon (1561-1626), Baron Verulam, a man 
who showed himself as exalted in mind as he 
was mean in personal traits, was of great im- 
portance. Bacon is a landmark in history as 
the defender and eulogist of modern realism, 
/. £., of inductive philosophy. While person- 
ally contributing but little to the advance of 
science, he taught a great method; as Gruen 
says, he was the philosopher of patents and 
profit; he recognized the compass, the art of 
printing, and gunpowder, as great inventions, 
but placed little value on the discovery *of 
Copernicus, having little comprehension of 
mathematics. Hobbes and Locke went fur- 
ther into realistic philosophy, and the latter 
was an exponent later of pure empiricism. 

In the seventeenth century, also, zoology 
and botany were largely extended. In it 
(1637 to 1680) lived Swammerdam, famous as 
a naturalist, physiologist, linguist, poet, and 
savant; there were others, also, whose names 
are better known in the history of collateral 
science than in medicine, and who left con- 
clusive demonstrations in accordance with 
their theories and made daily use of the mi- 
croscope, simple as it then was. The term 
"cell" had been introduced by Hooke in 
1667, and Malpighi and Grew were the found- 
ers of the cell doctrine. The astronomical

laws discovered by Copernicus changed the 
coarse of the world's thought; and now 

appeared the brilliant Kepler (1571 to 1630); 

and Galileo (1564 to 1642), the defender of 
the Coperni tern and the persecuted 

discoverer of the law of falling bodies, of the 
thermometer, t ; ope, and the move- 

ments of Jupiter; also Sit Isaac Newton 
(1642-1727), wl - ?erj ' the laws of 

gravitation in 1665 marked an era in the his- 
ton nee. This century too gave birth 

to Romer, who in 1675 calculated the velocity 
of light; Huyghens (1627-1693), who dis- 
covered the polarization of light and the 
satellites of Saturn: James Gregory, who in 
166 a reflecting telescope with a 

metallic concave mirror; Torrieelli, who in 
1643 measured the weight of the air; Gas- 
coigne who invented the micrometer in 1639; 
and Napier, who invented logarithms in 1700. 

Now chemistry, having ceased to be al- 
chemy, began to don the dignity of a science 
pcr se, and it may be claimed that medicine 
derived no slight benefit therefrom. Scien- 
tific societies and journals rose at this period, 
and were all of good service, to medicine in 
their way. The church scented danger to 
the faith in everything which related to 
natural science, and founded certain secret 
associations, especially in Italy; the Acca- 
demia Degli Lyncei, so called from its seal 
which bore the image of a fox or lynx, 
founded in Rome in 1603, was one of these. 
Counter societies, or rather societies with op- 
posite purposes, were also started, and the 
original and private so-called Invisible So- 
ciety, which was originated mainly by Milton 
in 1645, and remodeled by Charles \l. in 
1662, is now the flourishing Royal Society. 
In France the Academy was founded in 1665 
by Colbert, but developed its first real ac- 
tivity thirty-five years later. 

Those who to-day are so familiar with the 
course of the circulation of the blood through 
the arteries and veins, find it difficult to un- 
derstand how the recognition of this phe- 
nomenon could have been so long delayed; 
it seems so simple, yet to the ancients it 
was perfectly incomprehensible! Although 
every one had recognized that blood would 
flow from an incision, few stopped to reason 
thereupon. From time immemorial it had 
been supposed that the veins had their origin 



in the liver and were the only which 

contained blood, since the were 

always found empty after death; the latter 
were held to contain only air or spirit. Th&lt; 
circulation was supposed to leave and retun 
to the liver through the veilOUfi by un- 

dulating moY' Miliar to those of the 

waves of the ocean; and this was t: 
trine of the Asclepiada-, and probably 

stratus. Galen mollified this view by 
showing that the arteries contained blood; he 
knew it was poured into the right cavil 
the heart by the great veins, but he believed 
that only a small quantity passed from the 
right ventricle into the lungs, and that the 
major portion reached the left ventricle by 
g through pores in the inner ventricular 
septum This opinion was uncontested until 
the middle of the sixteenth century. 

Then the theologian Michael Servetus, who, 
m l 553i perished as the victim of Calvin's 
jealousy, denied the passage of the blood 
through this septum, contending it was re- 
turned from the lungs to the left side of the 
heart by the pulmonary veins. This « 
happy thought, and a great step towards the 
truth. Soon after, Columbus demonstrated 
anatomically that the conjecture of Servetus 
was plausible, by showing the function and 
real use of the valves of the heart. Ce^al- 
pinus came still nearer to the truth, and ex- 
plained, as did Columbus, the course of the 
circulation through the lungs, but he opined 
that blood and vital spirits passed from the 
arteries into the veins during sleep, because 
at that time there is swelling of the latter 
and diminution of the pulse. Valves in the 
veins were known, and it had been shown 
that ligature of an artery in the living animal 
stopped the flow below it, while if a veil 
were tied there was shrinkage above the liga- 
ture and swelling below it. Such was the 
state of science at the beginning of the 
seventeenth century; there remained practi- 
cally but one step to take, to find the true 
course of the blood. 

William Harvey was born in Folkestone, 
Kent, in 1578, and died in London, 1 
He first studied at Cambridge, entering at 
the age of fifteen; subsequently traveled ii 
France, Germany, and Italy, remaining ii 
1'adua from 1599 to 1602 in order to hear 
the lectures of Fabricius ab Aquapend 



THE MEDICAL AGE.

With the title of "Doctor" he returned and 
settled in London and soon became a mem- 
ber of the College of Medicine, of which he 
was made a regent in 1613; in time he be- 
came physician to James I., and, on the de- 
mise of this sovereign, to Charles I.; to the 
latter he dedicated his chief work. During 
the civil war he was driven from place to 
place and finally to Oxford, where he sur- 
rendered himself to the Parliamentary troops, 
after which he again resided in London with 
his brothers, who had become rich. Modesty 
led him to decline the high distinction of 
President of the College of Physicians, and 
he lived a quiet and retired life, occupied 
with his studies and, in his later years, in- 
vestigations in mathematics. Soon after 16 13 
he began through his lectures to make known 
the doctrine of the circulation of the blood; 
but he did not publish the results of his re- 
searches until 1628, after submitting them to 
fifteen years of proofs and counter-proofs of 
every kind. So bitter was the opposition of 
his contemporaries to the new doctrine that 
he at one time lost a part of his practice, and 
was even held to be demented. — It is charac- 
teristic of the fate of new truths, as well as 
of that age of dominant authority, that his 
first publication " Concerning the Motions 6f 
the Heart and the Blood" was unable to pass 
:ensorship in England, and therefore ap- 
peared in a foreign country (Frankfort, in 
!r628) when he was fifty years old; but his 
Second treatise on the same subject, in reply 
jo Riolan, a professor in the faculty of Paris, 
vas published in Cambridge in 1649. 
'■ "So much care and circumspection in 
earch for truth, so much modesty and firm- 
ess in its demonstration, so much clearness 
nd method in the development of his ideas," 
ays Renouard, "should have prepossessed 
very one in favor of the theory of Harvey; 
nt on the contrary it caused a general stupe- 
iction in the medical world, and gave rise to 
reat opposition." 

This theory, which to-day appears so nat- 
ral that we conceive with difficulty why it 
as not sooner discovered, was nothing less 
lan a revolution in physiology; it excited a 
emendous controversy that continued more 
;ian twenty-five years, and in which mingled 
rery one possessed of any pretension to 
iowledge of anatomy or physiology; even 



naturalists and philosophers took part in the 
dispute. Rene Descartes was the first to 
declare in its favor, and to support it by ex- 
periment; John Walseus (Jan de Wale), the 
celebrated professor of anatomy in the Uni- 
versity of Leyden, confirmed it by new obser- 
vations; finally Plempius, of Louvaine, for a 
time one of the most fiery of opponents, suc- 
cumbed to the truth, and in 1652 passed pub- 
licly to the ranks of Harvey's followers — no 
small triumph ! 

During these long debates Harvey remained 
always dignified and firm, although the early 
attacks rendered him unduly sensitive regard- 
ing others which he anticipated. About his 
only answer to the arguments adduced against 
him, was to add new proofs and new experi- 
ments to those already published. The only 
one of his adversaries who obtained a direct 
response was Riolan, who possessed immense 
influence among his contemporaries as a man 
of attainments; Riolan combated with equal 
violence and obstinacy the other great dis- 
covery of the age, viz., the circulation of the 
lymph. Harvey ultimately, however, had the 
satisfaction of seeing his theory universally 
adopted. But his services were not limited 
to this one discovery. He made most inter- 
esting observations on generation, both in 
man and in animals; on midwifery; and on 
the structure and diseases of the uterus. 

The bond of union and intermediary sys- 
tem between the arteries and veins, so very 
essential, yet up to this time unknown, was 
discovered by the great Malpighi, who was 
born in 1628 near Bologna, became professor 
in its university, and discovered in the lungs 
and mesentery of frogs, in 1661, the capillary 
circulation. He first described the corpus- 
cles of the blood in 1665; also discovered the 
lung cells, as well as the cutaneous glands, 
certain portions of the kidney, and the pig- 
mentary layer of the skin, named after him 
(rete Malpighi), which later furnished the 
first explanation of the difference of color in 
different races. 

In 1690 Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723), who 
had been making observations on the larvae of 
frogs and other small animals, was able to see 
with his improved microscope the movements 
of the blood in the small vessels, and gave 
important testimony of his observations. In 
1687 Cowper saw the passage of the arterial

dam, the famous inventor of minute injec- 
tions, who greatly advanced anatomy by the 

formation of collections, one of which was 
brought into Russia by Peter the Great at an 
expense of abotft $75,000. — The Russian 
transporters of the collection, however, drank 
the alcohol in which many of the preparations 
were preserved, and a portion of the - 1 
mens was thus ruined. 

Further illustration and amplification of 
Harvey's views came from various sources; 
the last, perhaps, from Nicholaus Steno (1638 
to 1686), who was first a professor in Copen- 
hagen, then a bishop and peripatetic con- 
verter of heretics. Steno first proved the 
heart is a muscle that contracts actively and 
expels the blood. The duct that bears his 
name was discovered during his residence in 
Leyden or at Amsterdam. His name is writ- 
ten also " Stenson." 

While ancient anatomists were able to de- 
scribe in a general way the form of the lungs, 
their location, consistency, the ring-like struc- 
ture of the trachea, and the first division of 
the bronchi, they did not go farther, but 
blindly accepted the prevalent theory that 
the bronchial tubes anastomosed with the 
terminal pulmonary veins, and that in this 
way atmospheric fluid was conveyed from 
the respiratory organs into the heart. On 
such vague and erroneous data was con- 
structed the theory that the air was drawn 
into the lungs by the heat of the heart, which 
was the reservoir of the vital spirits; that in 
penetrating through the smaller tubes it was 
rarefied, its thinnest part passing into the 
heart, where it served as material for the 
formation of the vital spirit, its grosser part 
being exhaled. In other' words, respiration 
was supposed to have two purposes: one to 
refresh the lungs, which, being porous and 
inflammable, would otherwise take fire from 
the heart or focus of animal heat; the other 
to furnish the pneuma, or ether, which was 
employed by the heart in the formation of 
animal spirits. Harvey's discovery upset all 
this, in great measure. 

Next it was shown that pulmonary veins 



Carried nothing to the heart except blood. 
And now, during this Reform Period, the 
purpose of the movements of the chest was 
better studied, for P.orelli. Helvetnis and 
Haller made many experiments, as the I 
of which it was determined that durii . 
spiratlOO the thorax is enlarged in all direc- 
tions, and during expiration partly col!. 
by relaxation of muscles, and that there never 
is any empty spaee between the lungs and 
the sides of the chest; further, that air is 
drawn into the chest by the tendency of all 
•US fluids to maintain an equilibrium, 
or, in other words, because Nature abhors a 
vacuum. This being settled, various pneu- 
matic theories were adopted and aband 
all of which had subsequently to give way 
before a knowledge of what really occur! 
The truth was conceived of by Mayow in 
1668. It had been noticed that blood which 
appeared black in issuing from the veins, be- 
came red in contact with the air, and direct 
observation proved a similar change of color 
to take place during its passage from the pul- 
monary veins during life. Goodwin, opening 
the thorax of a frog, was the first to see this, 
and Hessenfratz filled a silk bladder with 
venous blood, and, plunging it into an atmos- 
phere of oxygen, saw the blood change from 
black to red. In this way and by the later 
labors of Bichat and Lavoisier were clearly 
established the mechanism and the purpose 
of the function of respiration. 

The discovery of the lymphatic vessels and 
their purpose was scarcely less remarkable 
than that of the circulation, though marked 
by less eclat because it was not the work of 
one man but a matter of slow development. 
Herophilus and Erasistratus had seen white 
vessels connected with the lymph nodes ii 
the mesentery of animals, and supposed 
them to be arteries full of air. Galei 
puted this, for he believed the intestinal chyl&lt; 
was carried by the veins of the mesentery int&lt; 
the liver. In 1563 Eustachius described th&lt; 
thoracic duct in the horse. In 1622 Aselli 
professor of anatomy at Milan, discovert* 
the lacteal vessels in a dog which had beer 
killed immediately after partaking of food 
having pricked one of these by mistake, h&lt; 
saw a white fluid issue from it. Repe 
the experiment, he became certain the whitt 
threads were vessels which drew the &lt;

from the intestines. He observed^the valves 
with which they are supplied, and supposed 
these vessels all met in the pancreas and con- 
tinued on into the liver. In 1647 Pecquet, 
while still a student at Montpellier, discov- 
ered the lymph reservoir, or receptaculum chyli, 
and the canal which leads from it (the thor- 
acic duct), which he followed to its termina- 
tion in the left subclavian vein. Having 
ligated the duct, he saw it swell below and 
become empty above the ligature. He studied 
the courses of the lacteals, and convinced him- 
self that they all entered into the common 
reservoir. This discovery gave the last blow 
to the ancient theory which attributed to the 
liver the function of blood-making, and con- 
firmed the doctrine of Harvey. — Strangely 
enough, the latter united with Riolan in op- 
posing the discovery of Pecquet and denying 
its significance. From this time the lymphatic 
vessels and glands became objects of common 
interest and were investigated by many anat- 
omists—by Bartholin, Ruysch, the Hunters, 
Hewson, and above all by Mascagni, who was 
the first to give a graphic description of the 
whole lymphatic apparatus. 

The ancients confounded under the name 
"neuron" nerves, tendons, ligaments, and 
membranes; even Aristotle regarded the 
brain as an inert mass devoid of sensation, 
and supposed the nerves to originate in the 
heart. Rufus of Ephesus remarked that 
Herophilus distinguished three sorts of 
nerves, the first serving for sensation and 
motion and proceeding from the brain and 
spinal marrow, the second and third serving 
to unite bones and muscles. Galen also 
shared in this error, but nevertheless de- 
scribed the brain membranes and the differ- 
ence between white and gray matter; he 
supposed the cerebrum to be the seat of the 
soul and origin of sensory nerves, and that 
the cerebellum gave rise to nerves of motion; 
-he pulsation of the cerebrum exposed was 
held to be a sort of brain respiration. Galen 
came very near recognizing the distinction 
between nerves and tendons, but nevertheless 
Bonfused them. The anatomists of the six- 
seenth century described certain portions 
)f the nervous system with more exactness 
:han did Galen, but not with such positive- 
iess as to prevent Cesalpinus from renewing 
he Aristotelian theory that the heart was 



the origin [of sensation and the seat of the 
soul. Nearly two centuries later Baglivi ad- 
vanced a theory which referred vital move- 
ments to the heart and the dura mater. 

The progress which accrued to comparative 
anatomy and physiology, and the experiments 
which were made on animals, during this 
period, shed a great deal of light upon the 
nervous system. The researches of Vieus- 
sens, Haller, Meckel, Vicq dAzyr, Scarpa, 
Soemmerring, and others, had already ren- 
dered it manifest that the brain was the 
organ of sensation and voluntary motion; 
and Bichat had proposed to divide the nerv- 
ous system into cerebro-spinal and sympa- 
thetic branches. 

Now, too, Kepler discovered that the crys- 
talline lens was not the seat of vision, as had 
been supposed, but that its function, like that 
of other lenses, is the refraction of light. He 
observed that the image of objects is depicted 
upon the retina, and (with Scheiner) demon- 
strated that the expansion of the optic nerve 
in the retina is the essential part in the organ 
of sight. Obviously, also, interest in the 
anatomy of the eye, which these observations 
everywhere stimulated, was in a great meas- 
ure aided by the researches of Newton on 
light and color. 

About this time, too, Casserius and others 
studied the auditory apparatus and described 
the ossicles, the small muscles of the internal 
ear, and the semicircular canals; they even 
followed the acoustic nerve. By the re- 
searches of a number of French and Italian 
anatomists it was likewise established that 
the true seat of hearing lies within the in- 
ternal ear, the external parts being merely of 
assistance in conducting sound. 

Thomas Willis was one of the first to con- 
sider the brain as an assemblage of organs, 
and to assign special functions to certain of 
its divisions; he thus became a pioneer in 
cerebral localization, although most of his 
conjectures were inaccurate or fanciful. The 
workings of the brain were also studied by 
Pinel and others, who observed that in cer- 
tain conditions of mania or partial insanity 
some of the mental faculties, such as memory, 
judgment, imagination, or will, were abolished 
or suspended, while other faculties were pre- 
served; hence it was inferred that each 
faculty must have its own seat. The views 



174 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 



thus enunciated were earned to an absurd 

ree by Gall, and later by Spurxheim, who 

made an entirely new ation. believing 

the cranium to be molded in a reasonably 

t manner upon the brain, and that by 
inspection of the exterior the character of a 
•n individual could be read. They thus 
founded the pseud e denominated 

phrenology, which we now know has practi- 
cally nothing to justify itself. 

at the middle of the seventeenth cen- 
tury, Glisson (a professor in the University «&gt;f 
Oxford) recognized a property pertaining to 
all living tissue, which lie termed irritability, 
and which he regarded as sufficient cause for 
all the phenomena of life; he enunciated 
certain views that in times past have had an 
important bearing upon the pathology of dis- 
. but which were forgotten for sixty years 
or more until revamped by the Dutch anato- 
mist ( ioerter. It was the latter, with the great 
Haller, who, by a series of very ingenious 
experiments, elevated the suppositions of 
Glisson to the dignity of demonstrated facts. 
In i 747 the results of Haller's researches were 
published under the modest title of "First 
Lines in Physiology;" the author was, in 
fact, the great exponent of the doctrine of 
irritability in neuro physiology, and for this 
deserves to be remembered wherever the 
history of our art is spoken of. This theory 
of irritability was applied to pathology by 
Fabre, of Paris, who refuted the mechanical 
theory of Boerhaave on inflammation, prov- 
ing that the latter proceeds, not from obstruc- 
tion of the capillaries, but from exaltation of 
their irritability. It was also applied in many 
ways by Bichat, who enjoyed a brief though 
memorable career. The theory of irritability, 
along with the truths established by John 
Hunter in his researches on the blood, made 
a very distinct advance in the physiological 
knowledge of the seventeenth century, and 
the researches of those who contributed so 
much to its advance are well worthy of study 
even at the present day. In this line of in- 
vestigation should perhaps also be mentioned 
the names of Winslow, Albinus, the two Mon- 
roes, besides Vicq d'Azyr, and others already 
named. 

I have so far discussed the development of 
theories and researches of individuals. Dur- 
ing the earlier portion of the seventeenth 



century there happened something which 
gave to materia medica a remedy so valuable, 
and which attracted BUCfa wide- ttten 

tion, that it d( pecial mention — I re- 

fer to the discovery of that ^reat febrifuge, 
Peruvian bark Malaria: bad been 

known as early as the time of Hippoci 
and were universally treated largely with 
purgat with venesections. 

There had been no notable improvement in 
tin- management of pyrexias of this class 
down to 1638, when the Countess of Cinchoa] 
wife of the Viceroy of Peru, became a prey 
to a fever which nothing could remove It 
i&lt; said a Spaniard learned from the natives 
the secret of the bark, and advised its em- 
ployment, whereby the Countess recovered 
her health. — This is the generally received 
account, although it has been widely dis- 
credited, and Humboldt expresses decided 
doubts as to the source whence the first 
knowledge of the bark was derived. Be this 
as it may, however, it is certain that in 1639 
the Countess, and her physician DeYega, im- 
ported into Spain a quantity of ground Peru- 
vian bark, and distributed it to various per- 
sons, though it was not made an article of 
general commerce until ten years later, when 
it was exploited by the Jesuits, who had re- 
ceived a large supply; in Spain it was known 
as the "Countess's powder," and in Italy as 
"Jesuit" or "Cardinal" powder. Being very 
high-priced, it was soon so sophisticated as 
to be quite unreliable. Condamine, the bot- 
anist, having been sent to America for other 
purposes, determined the botanical position of 
the tree and described several species of 
cinchona, one of which is known by his 
name. To him is due the generic title be- 
stowed in acknowledgment of the services 
rendered by the Countess who introduced 
the bark into Europe. Many vain attempts 
were made to determine the chemical com- 
position of the powder, and it remained for 
two French chemists to isolate and separate 
its most important alkaloid. The first who 
wrote upon the therapy of cinchona was 
Barba, a Spanish physician, whose work was 
printed in Seville in 1642. After its intro- 
duction into England, Peruvian bark fell into 
disrepute, owing to improper administi 
whereby death was caused in certain in- 
stances; and it was this latter fact that

instigated Sydenham to investigate it still 
more accurately. There has never been in- 
troduced into medicine any one drug which 
has proved itself so generally valuable and 
so widely effective, as cinchona and its prod- 
ucts. 

As little progress had been made in obstet- 
rics as in other branches of applied medicine 
or surgery. The custom of employing mid- 
wires was general, and these for the most 
part were ignorant and filthy old women, 
slaves of routine procedures that had ob- 
tained from time immemorial. Educated 
accoucheurs were called only in extraordi- 
nary cases; but with progress the prejudice 
which excluded educated physicians from the 
practice of midwifery gradually gave way, 
and there was opened for obstetrics a new 
era. In the beginning of the seventeenth 
century the initiative was taken by Louise 
Bourgeois, the sage femme of Marie de Med- 
icis, who in 1626 published a collection of 
observations concerning sterility, abortion, 
fecundity, accouchment, and diseases of 
women and children generally; it embodied 
seyeral distinctly new ideas. A little later (in 
1668), Mauriceau, of Paris, chief accoucheur 
to the Hotel Dieu, published his treatise on 
diseases of pregnancy and childbirth, which 
was translated into all the languages of Eu- 
rope and became a powerful agent for good, 
not alone that it represented an advance in 
knowledge, but it stimulated such rivals and 
successors as Devanter, Peu, Paul Portal and 
Delamotte to further research. About this 
time the Chamberlains, an English family 
devoted to the practice of midwifery, invented 
an instrument to facilitate the extraction of 
the foetal head when arrested, and one of 
them went to Paris, and, failing of success 
there, passed on to Holland, where he sold 
his secret to two Dutch practitioners, who 
kept it only too faithfully. In 1721, Palfyn, 
1 surgeon of Ghent, while seeking to fathom 
:he device of the Chamberlains, conceived a 
*ire tete (literally a head drawer) composed of 
wo steel spoons, and hastened to publish an 
account thereof — a praiseworthy act, whereby 
ie merits distinction as the inventor of the 
orceps. As modified by Smellie in England, 
ind Levret in France, the obstetrical forceps 
anks among the most useful discoveries of 
nodern surgery, and, although not in common 



use until about a century ago, it may be said 
that the invention has been the means of 
saving the lives of countless women and chil- 
dren. 

Medical jurisprudence also seems to have 
had its beginning during this century. It 
had long been the practice to summon phy- 
sicians to court in order to enlighten the 
judiciary upon questions demanding particu- 
lar knowledge in physics and medicine; in- 
deed, the practice began under the first 
Christian emperors, and owes its origin to 
ecclesiastical authority. Charlemagne con- 
firmed in this regard what Justinian was 
perhaps the first to ordain. The tribunal of 
Chatelet, according to Renouard, appears to 
have been the first which comprehended the 
great utility of consultation with expert phy- 
sicians; an edict of Philip le Bel, in 1311, 
qualified Master John Potard with the title 
"Sworn Surgeon of Chatelet;" and the con- 
stitution promulgated by Charles V., in 1552, 
gave great importance to medical jurispru- 
dence, as it treated in detail of infanticide, 
wounds, poisons, abortion, and other such 
crimes. At the beginning of the seventeenth 
century Fidelis collated all that had been 
written on this subject, and thus published 
the first special treatise on legal medicine. 

Some writers claim to have discovered 
traces of clinical teaching in the history of 
Arabian universities, but, as Renouard says, 
the presence of a few pupils during visita- 
tions and consultations no more constituted 
real clinical teaching than the practice adopt- 
ed by some practitioners of ancient Rome of 
being ever surrounded by a group of specta- 
tors whom they dignified with the title of 
disciples. The first attempt at real clinical 
teaching appears to have been in the hospital 
of St. Francis, in Padua, in 1558, by Botoni 
and Oddi. About the beginning of the seven- 
teenth century Otto de Heurne, of the Univer- 
sity of Leyden, introduced bedside instruction, 
which was continued by Le Boe, sometimes 
called Sylvius, with the result of drawing 
large crowds of students to Leyden from 
1658 to 1672. Notwithstanding the success 
attained, the practice was neglected by the 
successors of Sylvius until renewed by Boer- 
haave, who, invested with several functions 
at the University of Leyden, also occupied 
the chair of medicine. So great was the

renown of Hoerhaave that, despite the 

erty of the resources of the Leyden hospital, 
people came to consult him from the most 
distant countries, and he was a correspondent 
Of several Crowned heads, even i)( the Pope, 

although himself a Protestant. During his 
life and long afterward he exerted an im- 
mense influence in medicine, and while, per- 
haps, inferior in genius to some of his con- 
temporaries, he had a wider reputation, and 
his doctrines prevailed longer. The great 
success of his clinics decided in favor of this 
method of teaching, and in 17 15 the Tope 
established in Rome a similar institution 
under the direction of the celebrated Lancisi. 
Soon Edinburgh, Vienna, Pavia and other 
universities followed suit, the first clinical 
chair in Paris being held by Corvisart, and 
the first in Vienna by Van Swieten. After 
the demise of Boerhaave, the school of Ley- 
den rapidly declined, while those of Edin- 
burgh and Vienna became rivals for first 
place. It is thus seen that after an interrup- 
tion of more than 2,000 years clinical teach- 
ing was revived and became more brilliant 
than ever before. 

I now propose to recount the methods and 
deeds of some of those concerned in the de- 
velopment of systems, so called, and make 
mention of the most prominent medical men 
in national and historical order. This will 
not preventing back to philosophical con- 
clusions or reflections upon the philosophy of 
the history of medicine, when it may seem 
wise so to digress. 

First of the system of J. P. Van Helmont, 
which in its day was most highly regarded, 
and which seems to have been in some meas- 
ure a rearrangement of the views of Paracel- 
sus into a mystic and pietistic system based 
upon mechanical principles. Van Helmont 
was born in Brussels in 1578, and was so pre- 
cocious that he entered the university of 
Louvain at an age which would have enabled 
him, had he so desired, to obtain the degree 
of Magister when only seventeen years old. 
He deemed the degree frivolous. He had 
studied mathematics, astronomy, philosophy, 
and astrology. Going now to the Jesuits, 
who at that time, even, taught magic, he soon 
became dissatisfied, and turned to the study 
of Stoical philosophy. Believing that the Ca- 
puchins (who were mere lascivious gluttons, 



and 1 »veu washing unchristian) 

the true Stoics, he sought to join 
this order, but ere long abandoned them 
and resumed his studies in law, botany, and 
medicine, lor the latter Van Helmont had 
at first little res; IC€ his stud:. 

this line did not enable him to rid himself of 
the itch. He soon again lapsed to the mo- 
nastics, and came to the conclusion that wis- 
dom, like the grace of God, was obtainable 
only by fasting, supplication, and poverty; 
accordingly he practiced medicine among the 
poor as a labor of love (having received his 
degree of Doctor in 1599). During his trav- 
els he became familiar with the writings of 
Paracelsus, which he studied zealously. Fi- 
nally he settled down in Vilvorde, where he 
practiced medicine and chemistry until his 
death (in 1644). 

Like most "systems," that of Van Helmont 
is valued only as an expression of the spirit 
of the age, since it embodied largely the 
pantheism of Paracelsus, merely cloaked with 
a more religious or monkish dress. He held 
that the general cause of disease was the fall 
of man; though there also figured a subsidi- 
ary cause which he denominated Archeus, a 
faculty of appetite seated in the spleen or in 
the stomach: thus dropsy was a hindrance 
of renal excretion by the enraged Archeus. 
Demons, witches and ghosts were included 
in Van Helmont's system as causes of dis- 
ease. Indeed, the man seems to have been 
a second Paracelsus, lacking only in the dis- 
honesty and bombast of the latter. He had 
no followers of any prominence, and the 
"system" soon lapsed into obscurity. 

The Chemical or Iatro-chemical system 
was originated by Le Boe, commonly known 
as Sylvius (but who must not be confounded 
with the great anatomist of the same name). 
Le Boe was born in Hanau in 16 14, studied 
in Paris, Leyden, and Basle, received his 
doctorate from the latter university at the 
age of twenty, and practiced in Switzerland 
with great success until 1660, when he ac- 
cepted a professorship in Leyden; here he 
was distinguished for his eloquence, wealth, 
and sociability, as well as for the great number 
of pupils that were attracted by his clinical 
method of teaching. His system embraced 
a peculiar phantasy, being based upon the 
elements of chemistry, the new knowledge of

ltt 



the circulation, the latest physiological teach- 
ings, and the old doctrine of the spirituous or 
innate heat of the heart, which he claimed 
to have felt with his finger. He asserted his 
theories were founded upon experience, but 
the truth is they were inaccurate deductions 
from experimental observations, many of 
which were wholly irrelevant. The majority 
of diseases, he taught, were produced by ex- 
cess of acidity or alkalinity. For him the 
three great fluids of the body were the saliva, 
the pancreatic fluid, and the bile, while health 
consisted in the undisturbed performance in 
the body of the process of fermentation; and 
the saliva was supposed to give rise to hectic 
fevers, because such manifest exacerbation 
after eating. Stereotyped theory and equally 
stereotyped therapeutics gained for him, for 
a short time, a large following, but later 
raised numerous opponents who alleged that 
his system cost as many human lives as the 
whole thirty years' war. He died in 1672. 

To the same iatro-chemical school is gen- 
erally assigned Thomas Willis, born in Ox- 
ford, 1622 (died in 1675), who rendered great 
service to anatomy, especially to anatomy of 
the nervous system, although his teaching 
was disfigured by certain unsupported theo- 
ries. Like Van Helmont, he had been des- 
tined for theology, but turned his attention 
to medicine. Ultimately he became profes- 
sor of philosophy in the University of Oxford. 
;He first described the so-called circle of 
Willis, whence its name; also ascribed diseases, 
especially those of the blood, to fermentation, 
fin which the vital spirits played the chief 
part.— He accounted for hysteria, for in- 
stance, by the union of the spiritus with 
imperfectly purified blood.

THE LATE DOCTOR WORTHINGTON. 

It is with deep regret that we are compelled 
to announce the death of Edward Dagge 
Worthington, M.D., M.A., F.R.C.S., which 
took place at Sherbrooke, Quebec, on Mon- 
day, February 25th last. 

Doctor Worthington was the doyen of the 
medical profession in the Eastern Townships 
of Quebec, having been in actual practice 
there for more than fifty years. His reputa- 
tion, however, was Provincial rather than 
local, and for many years he was recognized 
as the leading surgeon in the Lower Prov- 
inces. 

Born in Ballinakill, Queen's County, Ire- 
land, December 1st, 1820, two years later he 
came with his parents to Canada. In 1834 
he was indentured for seven years as a medi- 
cal student with that distinguished practi- 
tioner, the late James Douglass, of Quebec, 
but was released from his apprenticeship at 
the end of five years to enable him to accept 
an appointment as Assistant Surgeon to H. M. 
56th Foot, then quartered in "Lower Can- 
ada," and subsequently (1845) was promoted 
to Staff Assistant Surgeon, serving with H. 
M. 68th Light Infantry. Later he resigned 
his commission to proceed to Edinburgh, 
where he attended lectures at the University, 
winning the gold medal in his year; he was 
in "auld Reekie" during the Burke and Hare 
trials and Snowball Riots, a graphic account 
of which appeared from his pen in The 
Medical Age last year. He passed a most 
brilliant examination for the degree of Doctor 
of Medicine, which was bestowed upon him

upon active practice. In 1X55 the 
University of Bishop's College conferred 
upon him honoris causa the d&lt; M.A.. 

and in 1868 the University of McGill Col- 
lege granted him the degree ad eundem of 
CM., M.H. Foi some years he was lik* 

one of the governors of tin e of Physi- 

cians and Surgeons of Lower Canada. He- 
was the first president of the St. Francis Dis- 
trict Medical Association, and to his zeal, to 
a great extent, was due the organization of 
anadian Medical Association. 

Doctor Worthington was the first surgeon 
in Canada to perform a capital operation un- 
der an anesthetic — the first to use both ether 
and chloroform. He also manifested deep 
interest in military affairs, and in 1 86 1 was 
named surgeon to the 53d Battalion, and later 
promoted to Surgeon-Major, which rank he re- 
tained upon retirement. As a physician and 
surgeon he enjoyed the fullest confidence of 
the community; for over thirty years he had 
nearly all the surgical practice in the "East- 
ern Townships." He moreover had the full 
confidence of his medical confreres, who fre- 
quently sent for him from long distances. 

As the physician and friend of the poor, 
Doctor Worthington was preeminently distin- 
guished. He was one of the kindest and most 
lovable of men, and his traits of character were 
such that they could not but endear hiro to a 
very wide circle of friends. Theself-sacrificing 
devotion with which he gave his time and 
abilities to the practice of his profession, 
regardless of pecuniary emoluments, was 
deemed worthy of public recognition, and he 
on several occasions received substantial 
marks of public favor, among others a solid 
silver tea service presented by the people and 
the medical profession of the Eastern Town- 
ships, as an evidence of their appreciation of 
his efforts to succor the impecunious and 
afflicted. On another occasion he was the 
recipient of an elegant gold watch and chain, 
tendered to mark the appreciation of his en- 
ergetic and successful efforts to stamp out 



an epidemic &lt;A that most loathsome of id 

Jlpoz. 
In ! Worthington served 

private in Captain I 1 M Miner's company of 
the Quebec regiment of Volunteer ! 
Infantry; he likewise saw rvice iu a 

professional capacity m both Fenian ra 

He was a member of the Church of Eng- 
land; in politics a Conservative 

In 1845 he was united in marriage to Kanny 
Louisa Smith, oldest daughter of the 
Honorable Hollis Smith, the first member 
elected to the Legislative Council for the&gt; 

Division of Wellington. Mrs. Worthington 
died in April, [887, and of the eight children 
that blessed this union, five survive, 
of whom follows the professional foots: &lt; 
his father. 

Doctor Worthington frequently contributed 
to medical periodicals, notably the Montreal'. 
Medical Journal, and wielded a most facile 
pen: his descriptions were always pointed- 
and terse, never marked by space-writing or 
verbosity; as an author he had few equals. 
During 1894 he was a frequent contributor 
to The Medical Age, and his most inter- 
esting "Reminiscences" of medical study 
and practice of half a century ago excited 
the admiration of all who were fortunate 
enough to peruse them; they constituted 
exquisite bits of word-painting and quaint 
humor, and were widely copied, securing only 
the superlatives of favorable criticism. These 
sketches were penned at odd moments, dur- 
ing the intervals when he was free from suf- 
fering, for he had for some time been a 
helpless invalid; indeed, the last contribution, 
"Watson and Bell's Section," was written in 
bed. 

As his physical condition became worse, 
even the delights of authorship were denied 
— "one more pleasure taken away," he wrote 
the editor of the Age, "and I now look for- 
ward almost with eagerness to the moment 
when I shall lay down the burden of life." 
His death was not unexpected — it was under- 
stood by himself and family that the end 
might come at any moment. He was, as he 
often remarked, " weary, weary, beyond ex- 
pression." Happily he was spared great 
suffering, and no little child in its mother's 
arms ever went to sleep with greater peace 
and restfulness than that which marked the

passing of this grand and noble character 
"beyond the dark river." 

He will be greatly missed, not alone by his 
family and by the friends made through The 
Medical Age, but by the entire medical pro- 
fession of Canada, of which he was so dis- 
tinguished an ornament. Indeed, his whole 
life was intimately interwoven with the medi- 
cal history of Canada, and was an integral 
part of the history of the Province of Quebec. 
It is the lot of few men to be so noble, so 
distinguished, so loved, and so missed. 



NEW LIGHT ON COD=LIVER OIL. 

Under this caption the Chemist and Drug- 
gist (London) reviews the chemistry of Cod- 
liver Oil as studied by F. Peckel Moeller. 

The practical results of M©el!er's researches 
have been incorporated in a new method of 
preparing the oil, which consists in exclud- 
ing free oxygen during the process of ren- 
dering and bottling. It is also shown that 
:he removal of stearine from the oil is a 
juestionable proceeding. 

Doctor Moeller reaches the conclusion that 
'the real value of Cod-liver Oil resides in 
he fatty acids contained in the form of gly- 
:erides," and that "obviously the great point 
s to preserve these acids absolutely un- 
hanged." 

Many of the time-honored traditions re- 
ading Cod-liver Oil are shattered by 
)octor Moeller. After remarking that it 
occupies a very unique position, and sub- 
titutes for it are consequently becoming 
ery numerous," he tells us why most of 
lese substitutes fail and must continue to 
111. He lays down as strongly as language 
r chemical data can be made, that "Cod- 
ver Oil is a food sui generis; that it has no 
:tive principle; and that in taking it it is a 
ise of all or none" — a sentiment that is 
*artily re-echoed by the Chemist and Drug- 
's t! 



ARGON. 



At a meeting of the Royal Society in Jan- 
iry last, Lord Rayleigh and Professor Wil- 
im Ramsay presented a paper announcing 
e demonstration of a new substance in the 
mosphere, which they term Argon. 



It had previously been shown by the former 
gentleman that nitrogen extracted from chem- 
ical compounds was about one-half of one per 
cent, lighter than that obtained from the 
atmosphere; hence he was led to study at- 
mospheric gases under a number of different 
conditions, and the above-mentioned discov- 
ery was the result. 

Argon is prepared by freeing air from oxy- 
gen through the medium of red-hot copper, 
residue being passed from a gas-holder to a 
combustion tube heated in a furnace (also 
containing copper) in order to remove all 
traces of oxygen; the issuing gas is now dried 
by passage over soda-lime and phosphorus 
pentoxide, then made to enter a combustion 
tube packed tightly with magnesium turn- 
ings, and heated to redness in a second fur- 
nace. Ultimately the Argon is transferred 
to a small gas-holder and caused to circulate 
through a series of tubes of copper, copper 
oxide, soda-lime, phosphorus pentoxide, and 
red-hot magnesium turnings, until freed from 
any possible contamination with oxygen, 
hydrogen, hydrocarbons, or nitrogen. It is 
preserved over mercury or over water satu- 
rated with itself. 

Notably all attempts to combine Argon 
with other elements have so far failed. It is 
suspected, however, that it is not an element, 
but a compound, as it partakes of the nature 
of a monatic gas. 



EDITORIAL NOTES. 



A Lay by a Layman. — 

Did you ever know a bill like a doctor's bill — 

So easy to create and so difficult to kill? 

Steady as the strokes from the hand of Fate, 

Visit after visit doth the sum accumulate — 

And the medico forgetteth not a solitary date. 

Seldom doth he bring his bitter dope along, 

But he gives the druggist orders to make it good 

and strong: 
Something for the stomach, for the kidneys, lungs, 

and spleen, 
With dynamite to touch them off, or mtro-glycereen; 
" Aquae fceniculi, ext. haematox. campech.," 
And other Latin epithets to rattle in your neck; 
" Inf. gentianae, tinct. card, co., 
Haust. !" What do you think of that, to make the 

liver go? 
And many a time I've read it., though I don't know 

what it's for: 
"Syr. limon., potass, citratis, tinct. ferri perchlor."

W. A. 1 . 

The Utt of Nuclein.— 

Under "Some Clinical Notes on the Use 

tclein," contributed to the Therapeutic 
Gazette, Doctor Frank W. (iarber cites thir- 
teen cases benefited by the exhibition of this 



red under the form i 

were 

of ti: ne of neurasthenia, one of 

follicular tonsillitis, and one of troublesome 

- with phli ellulitis induced by 

a slough;:.. :i leading from the se&lt; ond 

high into the palm of the hand. I&gt;oc- 

ncludes from these experiments 

that he is "warranted in claiming we ha 

gent of value in incipient tuber- 
culosis." Whether it is "positively • urative" 
he is not yet in position to say, but 
" It seems true that by its early use it is 
- &gt; build up patients as to give 
them a longer lease of life and very much 
more comfort. If the patient is in p&lt; 
to take advantage of favorable climati* 
ditions, I have great faith in the complete 
restoration to health by the use of N'uclein of 
a large number of persons who now die under 
the old methods of treatment." 

Commercial Science.— 

Recently the British Medical Jouma 
sented a timely remonstrance against the 
growing tendency to prostitute progress in 
medical science to personal gain. It : 
out that " from time immemorial it has been 
the honorable tradition that every disc&lt;&gt;ve 
made by a medical man, tending to the re 
lief of suffering or the preservation of healt 
should be freely communicated to the worl 
and placed at the disposal of the profession" 
The Pharmaceutical Journal and Transactions 
declares that Doctor Hans Aronson, of Char- 
lottenburg, has recently made application in 
Great Britain for letters patent for a method 
of separating antitoxins from serum by means 
of metallic hydrates. This, it is urged, is 
both 4&lt; unprofessional and contrary to public 
policy," and "government should be 
to consider whether protection in such a case 
would be justifiable." 

Thyroid in Obesity.— 

The rapid loss of body-weight attending 
the treatment of myxoedema with thyroid 
very naturally suggests the applicability of 
Line method in obesity. Doctors Charrin, 
Leichtenstern and Wendelstadt observed a 
manifest diminution of embonpoint in twenty- 
two of twenty-five obese subjects after a 
course with fresh sheep-thyroids. The good

fleets are ascribed to more active combus- 
ion of accumulated fat, rather than to the 
liuresis which is so marked a feature of the 
nitial stage of treatment. The actual wast- 
ng observed varied in individual cases from 
me to five kilogrammes during the first week, 
.nd from one to nine in the subsequent weeks. 

'To Make White Crows or Ravens."— 

In " The Young Ladies' School of Arts," 
&gt;y Mrs. Hannah Robertson, published in two 
rolumes in Edinburgh in 1777, there appears 
&gt;n page 139 of the first volume the following 
istounding psycho-physiological information: 

Rub with the fat of a white cat some crow's 
iggs — those newly laid are the best; let the eggs 
ilso be done over with the brains of said cat; after- 
wards set them to be hatched by a very white pullet, 
:hat has never hatched before. During the whole 
time she must be kept impervious to the sun and 
the place must be hung with white linen clothes, 
and the crows or ravens produced from these eggs 
will be white. 

For Tapeworm.— 

IJ Powdered pomegranate-root bark, 4 drachms. 
Pumpkin seeds (fresh), ground, % drachm. 
Ethereal extract of male-fern, 1 drachm. 

Boil the pomegranate-root bark and pumpkin 
seeds in half a pint of water for fifteen minutes, 
strain and allow to cool, and then add half a drachm 
of normal liquid ergot. 

Take the ethereal extract of male-fern, add to it 
two minims of croton oil, and rub up thoroughly 
with two drachms of powdered gum arabic; with 
this make an emulsion with the above decoction. 

Ingest at one dose. 

It is said this will remove the tapeworm 
within two hours. 

"The University Founded by Franklin." — 

Under this title Doctor J. Howe Adams in 
the Peterson Magazine for March gives a most 
interesting description of the rise, develop- 
ment and aims of the University of Pennsyl- 
vania. The paper is well worthy of perusal 
as forming a part of the history of a great 
commonwealth. 

Demise of a Noted Alienist. — 

Doctor Hack Tuke, of London, one of the 
foremost alienists and neurologists of the 
age, is dead. His demise leaves a large gap 
in the ranks of neurological specialists, that 
will not be easy to fill. 



Items and News, 



Old Age.— 

During the past year, in the obituary col- 
umn of one of the leading London papers, 
the deaths of 7,129 persons were announced. 
Of these it is stated that 998 had passed by 
ten years the age which the Psalmist said 
constitutes the span of human life. There 
were no fewer than five centenarians in the 
list — two men and three women. In the 
news columns of the same journal no fewer 
than thirty- five centenarians, in addition to 
the above five names, appeared. Ireland, and 
particularly County Cork, has furnished the 
most remarkable instances in the past year 
of persons having attained an age considera- 
bly beyond 100 years. In July there died 
near Middleton, County Cork, a widow whose 
age was vouched for as 115. At the time of 
her death she had a daughter living with her, 
aged 85. In the same neighborhood in Sep- 
tember a man died at the age of 112. An- 
other, who died at the age of 105, was at 
work upon his farm within six months of his 
decease. A woman who died in December, 
aged no, had a vivid recollection of the 
landing of the French at Killala. On the 
9th of January, 1894, at Manchester, the 
death took place of William Hampson, who 
claimed to be the Queen's oldest subject, 
and who had seen his 115th New Year's Day 
in 1894; he had as a boy heard John Wesley 
preach in Trinity Church, Salford. Two of 
his sons were killed in the Crimea, and four 
of his uncles fell on the field of Waterloo. — 
London Correspondence of American Lancet. 

Suppression of Nostrum Traffic. — 

In contrast with the efforts on the part of 
some members of the American Medical 
Association to exorcise certain salutary re- 
strictions from the Code of Ethics are the 
numerous indications of a disposition on the 
part of the dental profession to elevate its 
standard both ethically and educationally. 
In a paper read some time ago before the 
First District Dental Society of the State of 
New York, Doctor E. C. Kirk, of Philadel- 
phia, showed that a large number of nostrums 
recommended for the relief of various pain- 
ful affections of the teeth and gums con- 
tained cocaine, despite emphatic assertion to 
the contrary. The danger of such prepara- 
tions in unskilled hands is entirely too obvious 
to require extended comment. The Dental 
Cosmos notes editorially that a movement has 
been set on foot in Mississippi having for its 
object the prohibition by legislative enact- 
ment of the use of nostrums in connection

ation of noble medical character by help ng

characters pure and clean. — Medical News. 

The Circus.— 

The editor of a religious paper in Iowa 
gives the following reasons for his love for 
the circus: 

11 As we gaze at the lions, tigers, and monk- 

5, and think that nature made all of them, 

are not so sure. And when we look at 

the beautiful young lady, with nothing on but 

a blue ribbon around her waist, with one leg 

pointing to six o'clock and the other to high 

noon, and think that nature made her too, 

just, as she is except the ribbon, we begin 

can up to the circus. But when the 

brass band begins to play and the elephants 

go round, we rush in for a front seat to get 

in ahead of the ministers, who always wear 

jpipe hats and won't sit down in front." 

A Universal language.— 

lical practitioners continue to worry 
themselves about this "fad;" only a certain 
proportion of those who advocate a universal 
language for the profession recognizing the 
fact that they are already assumed to posse — 



a knowledge of a language which is practi- 
cally universal. But the k .cot Latin 
is more frequently theoretical than pra&lt; 
and there B disinclination to 
master its intricacies. It may be suggested 

that English is well on the way to becomind 

the universal Ian. d that those who 

it might do well to obtain a 

thorough knowledge of it. The result would 

be much more profitable on the whole thai 

an imperfect acquainl th several an- 

cient and modern tongues. — PharmaCi 
Journal and Transactions. 

The Rocking; Chair as a Therapeutic Measure.— 

tor Laine declares that by resorting to 
a slow and regular rocking motion after 
meals, gastrointestinal p&lt; simu- 

lated, and persons whose digestive functions 
are habitually sluggish thereby experience 
marked relief. He especially recommends 
this measure in atony of the stomach. 

The rocking chair should be so constructed 
as io be set in motion without much effort, 
and the inclination of the axis should be 
sufficient to place the patient in an almost 
horizontal position. — The Lancet 

Death of an Aged Woman.— 

"Aunt" Eunice Conrad, whose maiden 
name was Mace, died at her home near 
Cedarville, Gilmore County, West Virginia] 
March 4th, in her one hundred and twentieth 
year. She was born August 4th, 1775, ln 
Pendleton County, of Scotch parentage; and 
was married in 1805 to Jacob Conrad, after- 
wards a soldier of the war of 1812. She had 
full use of her mental faculties up to the last. 
Her youngest son, with whom she resided, is 
sixty- five years of age. 

The New Woman.— 

Physiologically, the new woman is a vast 
improvement over the other woman. She is 
not a delicate, pallid, emotional, unknown 
quantity. She is a creature full of energy 
and decision. She takes systematic stock of 
her vital capital and endeavors in every way 
to increase it. She lives in a hygienic, regu- 
lar fashion, eats three hearty meals a day. is, 
fond of athletics, and keeps in touch with the 
world mentally and physically. 

Tit for Tat.— 

In the Journal oj the American Medical 
Association Doctor Keiper criticises the pat- 
ronizing tone of papers written by certaii 
specialists on the text, "What the general 
practitioner should know about " the par- 
ticular disease which they (the specialists)

write a volume or two on "What the special- 
ists should know of general practice." — Medi- 
cal Times. 

Honest Fame.— 

jinks (on the rail): "I was talking to an 
eminent physician in the smoker " 

Mrs Jinks: " What is his name?" 

"He didn't mention it, and I didn't like to 
ask him." 

"Then why do you think he is an eminent 
physician?" 

" I asked what was the best cure for con- 
sumption, and he said he didn't know." — 
Puck. 

Ea-What's This?— 

The Boston Traveler says: "A butterfly 
was caught at the South End yesterday." 

It may be safe enough to catch a butterfly 
at the south end, but when you go to grab a 
wasp you want to catch it at the northeasterly 
end, shifting westerly toward the head. — 
Scottish American. 

Division of Profits.— 

A bushel of corn is said to make four gal- 
lons of whiskey. The farmer gets forty cents, 
the railroads a dollar, the government $3.60, 
the manufacturer about $5.00, and the saloon- 
keeper $6.00, out of the $16.00 for which it is 
sold, while the drinker gets the refuse, and — 
delirium tremens. 

Is it a Libel?— 

God made the earth in six days, and then 
rested; then he made man, and rested again. 
Then he made woman; and since that time 
neither God nor man has had a rest. — Medi- 
cal World. 

Suggestive.— 

Physician: "What is your profession, sir?" 
Patient (pompously): "I'm a gentleman." 
Physician: "Well, you'll have to try some- 
thing else; it does not agree with you." — 
Tid-Bits. 

Pathological Sarcasm.— 

The princes and potentates of Europe are 
aptly described as men with all kinds of 
orders on their breasts, and all sorts of dis- 
orders in their blood. — Exchange. 

Cheap Doctors.— 

It is reported that a medical college in 
Denver, Colorado, advertises to give free 
tuition to all students from without the 
State.

Human Anatomy. By Henry Morris, A.M., M.D., 
London. Cloth; 8vo; pp. 1286. Price, $7.50. 
P. Blakiston, Son &amp; Co., Philadelphia. 

This is the most complete anatomical text- 
book which has ever come to our table, and 
remarkable in that the illustrations are true 
to perspective — a peculiarity very seldom 
observed. Written by ten of the foremost 
anatomists and surgeons of the day, it is in 
its style concise, harmonious, and well bal- 
anced, bearing evidence of the highest skill 
and thoroughness on the part of the editor. 
Dealing with the subject as now taught in 
the medical schools, this work is for teachers 
and students alike the most complete and 
practical text-book ever presented. Hereto- 
fore works on anatomy have been not only 
uninteresting but for the most part absolutely 
appalling in their awkward and verbose pre- 
sentation of facts. Morris's Anatomy, on the 
contrary, commands the interest of the stu- 
dent from the initial chapter to the final 
page. 



Twentieth-Century Practice. Edited by Thomas 
L. Stedman, M.D. Volume I. Cloth; 8vo; pp. 
737- Price, $5.00. William Wood &amp; Co., New 
York. 

This volume is devoted to diseases of the 
aropoietic system and is the advance number 
)f a series that, when completed, will be a 
practical epitome of modern medical science. 
The contribution on diseases of the kidney is 
)y Doctor Francis Delafield; diseases of the 
/enal pelvis, the ureters and the bladder 
ire discussed by Mr. Reginald Harrison 
London); diseases of the prostate and male 
irethra by G. Frank Lydston; haematuria, 
ystinuria, chyluria and pyuria by Mr. H. 
r enwick (London). The closing chapters 



are devoted to diseases of the female blad- 
der and urethra, by Howard A. Kelly, who 
thoroughly elucidates his new method of ex- 
amination never before treated in any text- 
book or treatise. 



Mental Diseases. By Daniel Qark, M.D. Cloth; 
i6mo; pp. 328. Price, $1.25. William Briggs, 
Toronto. 

This is one of the best introductions to the 
study of mental disease it has been our lot to 
encounter, and yet it purports to be no more 
than a synopsis of twelve lectures delivered 
at the Hospital for the Insane at Toronto to 
the graduating medical classes. Though in- 
tended as a guide for senior medical students, 
it is equally available as a manual of psycho- 
physics for the busy physician. It is emi- 
nently practical, and yet devoid of the vast 
amount of useless material that usually en- 
cumbers works of this kind. We cordially 
commend it as a text-book and work of refer- 
ence, the more so as its style and general 
make-up are calculated to interest rather 
than repel the reader. 



A Pathogenic Materia Medica. By the Medical 
Investigation Club of Baltimore, Maryland. 
Cloth; 8vo; pp. 347. Price, $2.00. Boericke &amp; 
Tafel, Philadelphia. 

This is a publication under one cover of 
numerous studies that have on various occa- 
sions appeared in the Hahnemannian Monthly 
and the Southern Journal of Ho)7iaiopathy. 
The welcome received from the homoeopathic 
fraternity was such that it was deemed ad- 
visable to piace these studies in a form where 
they could readily reach a larger number of 
readers. Forty-seven drugs have been studied 
from a homoeopathic standpoint, and the 
volume certainly cannot but be of interest to 
gentlemen of this school.

Therapeutic Brevities. 

tetic Treatment of Phthisis. — Never take 
COUgh mixtures if they bly be 

led: 

1 should be taken at least six tim&lt; 

the twenty-four hours; light repasts be". 
the meals and on retiring: 

1 I not eat when suffering from bodily or 
mental fatigue or nervous excitement: 

Take a nap, or at least lie down for twenty 
minutes, before the mid-day and evening 
meals: 

Starches and sugars should be avoided, as 
well as all indigestible articles of diet: 

far as possible each meal should con- 
sist of articles requiring about the same time 
t&lt;&gt; digest: 

( )nly eat qs much as can be easily and fully 
digested in the time allowed: 

\- long as possible, systematic exercise 
should be taken to favor assimilation and 
excretion: when this is impossible, massage 
or passive exercise should be undergone: 

The food should always be nicely prepared 
and daintily served — made inviting in every 
way. 

The following diet sheet is suggested for 
the early stage: On awakening: Eight ounces 
of equal parts of milk and seltzer, taken 
slowly through half an hour. Breakfast: 
Oatmeal and cracked wheat with a little 
sugar and abundance of cream; rare steak or 
loin chop with fat; soft-boiled or poached 
agg; cream toast; half pint of milk; and a 
small cup of coffee. Early lunch: Half-pint 
of milk or small teacup of squeezed beef- 
juice with stale bread. Mid-day meal: Fish; 
broiled or stewed chicken; scraped meat- 
ball; stale bread and plenty of butter; baked 
apples and cream; and two glasses of milk. 
Afternoon lunch: Bottle of Koumyss, raw 
scraped-beef sandwich, or goblet of milk. 
Dinner: Substantial meat or fish soup; rare 
roast beef or mutton; game; slice of stale 
bread; spinach; cauliflower; fresh vegetables 
in season (sparingly). — Practitioner. 



Topical Uses of Chloral and Iodoform. — A 
valuable application to ulcerated surfaces is 
a solution of Chloral hydrate in glycerin and 
water in the respective proportions of one, 
two. and ten. It relieves pain, cleanses the 
parts, and will be found useful in cancerous 
ulcerations of the tongue, mammary gland, 
vagina, uterus, rectum, and glans penis; in 
varicose ulcers, phagedenic ulceration, gan- 
grenous sloughs, herpes zoster, eczema, im- 
petigo, etc. A more healthy character and 
appearance is stimulated, the discharges 



to become less offensive, and pain is reduced 
a minimum — these effe apparently doc 

to its action upon peripheral-nerve termina- 
tions. Chloral in glycerin (one to two) is 
also a valuable injection in hydrocele. 

In rectal fissures and painful if. 
about the anus, an ethereal solution of 1 
form applied after manual stretching tends 
to overcome the spasmodic stricture of the 
sphincters. Nothing is pleasanter or more 
efficacious than the same applied with a hair 
pencil to ulcers of the lips and gums and 
painful conditions of the nasal mucous mem- 
brane — the strength ordinarily used is four 
drachms of iodoform to the ounce of ether. 
A better preparation perhaps is Collodoform, 
which should be a clear, transparent mixture, 
and is thus prepared: 

\i F.thereal tincture of iodoform (i to 16). 12 
drachms. 

Solution of boracic acid in glycerin (i 

S drachms. 
Collodion, 16 drachms. 

Apply as a coating to the ulcer, morning and 
evening. 

It relieves the pain and promotes healing, of 
anal fissures. 



Administration of Male Fern. — The active 
principle of this agent is an acid which is 
absorbed with difficulty. This acid, however, 
when combined with fatty or ethereal oils is 
more readily absorbed, and thus sets up more 
easily symptoms of poisoning. In severe 
poisoning there may be cerebro-spinal par- 
alysis, but in the milder cases violent vomit- 
ing, abdominal pain and faintness may be 
noted. The slighter symptoms are more fre- 
quent, such as icterus (which is mostly ab- 
sent in the more rapidly fatal cases). Crawitz 
observed jaundice only occasionally as a 
sequel to catarrh of the bile ducts. He ex- 
amined the blood in some ten case- 
found evidence of destruction of red cells; 
but since haemoglobin was absent from the 
serum, he concludes this destruction doe 
not take place in the circulation, but in the 
liver itself. Four cases are recorded in v 
there was cirrhosis of the liver as well as 
helminthiasis, and where the hepatic symp- 
toms were much aggravated after the use of 
Male Fern. This drug should therefore 
given cautiously where there is any evident 
of hepatic disease, and especially in the alco- 
holic or syphilitic. It is also well to 
the use of castor oil along with the extract. -

three years old had an attack of influenz 



THE MEDICAL AGE.

December, 1893, with high, persistent fever, 
headache, and slight cough. During the long 
convalescence she began to suffer from sweat- 
ing, which came on after the least exertion, 
and gradually increased until it poured off in 
rivulets. Together with this hyperidrosis she 
had dull red patches on the skin, which were 
more or less persistent. There was no notice- 
able alteration, either subjectively or objec- 
tively, in the nervous system. There was a 
slight systolic murmur at the apex, and some 
accentuation of the second sound of the heart 
in the pulmonary area. Atropine, agaricin, 
camphor, gallic acid, and other antisudorifics 
were tried, but with no effect. I concluded 
the sweating was due to a vaso-motor par- 
alysis, and the presence of the dull red patches 
on the skin offered confirmatory evidence of 
this diagnosis. As Picrotoxin has a stimu- 
lating action on the vaso motor centre, I 
administered it twice a day in doses of half a 
milligramme each. The result was highly 
satisfactory. The sweats gradually dimin- 
ished, and in eight days had entirely disap- 
peared. — Mariano Semmola, in Riforma 
Medica. 



To Abort Carbuncle and Malignant Pustule. 
— Take a large hypodermatic syringe, fill 
with a i-to-500 solution of Bichloride, insert 
the needle in one of the peripheral openings, 
and wash out the little cavity. Then direct 
the needle toward and into the surrounding 
induration and force a little of the solution 
into it. 

Treat every opening and its corresponding 
peripheral surroundings in the same manner, 
carefully washing out the necrosed connec- 
tive and other tissues that have become 
separated. 

Repeat this procedure daily, gradually re- 
ducing the solution to one-half the original 
strength, until all indurations have disap- 
peared and granulations begin to make them- 
selves manifest. If the first injection be 
thoroughly performed, the spread of the car- 
buncle will be arrested at once and there will 
be no more pain. Washing out the little 
cavities is painless, but the injection into the 
indurated tissues is not. 

This treatment is applicable to the little 
.furuncles that invade the external meatus of 
: the ear and the inner surfaces of the alae of 
:he nose.— Doctor Baker, in Medical Week. 



effect. When given in the primary stage it 
induces free diaphoresis, and all the glands 
are made active; in this way the lung is en- 
abled to throw off its engorgement, and the 
whole nervous system is relaxed. In the 
secondary stage of pneumonia, Jaborandi 
has only the effect to lessen the fever. After 
giving the fluid extract I follow with quinine, 
and stimulants if indicated, and seldom re- 
quire more than three doses to secure the 
desired effect. 

The cases I fail to abort, I find, run a 
milder course, so that no time is lost by giving 
the Jaborandi in the primary stage. If bleed- 
ing is ever advisable in pneumonia it is in the 
first stage, thus relieving the engorgement, 
and Jaborandi exerts the same influence 
without the loss of the blood. — Doctor O. H. 
Burford, in the Proceedings of the Georgia 
Medical Association. 



Cold Bath in Puerperal Septicazmia. — The 
cold bath is contra-indicated'when peritonitis, 
phlegmon of the broad ligaments, or phleg- 
masia dolens exists. It has proved successful 
when grave maladies, such as measles, ery- 
sipelas, eclampsia, or bronchitis, have com- 
plicated the puerperal infection. Treatment 
must not be delayed when high temperature 
and general constitutional disturbance have 
set in. First of all, make sure that the uterus 
is free from the products of conception. 
Then, should the temperature rise over 101 , 
the bath must be used. It is often of value 
when the temperature is lower, the patient 
already suffering from headache and hot 
skin. The bath should be a little over 75 
F., as a rule. It is right to leave the patient 
in till she shivers, especially when hyperpy- 
rexia is the most marked symptom; in other 
respects the same precautions are needed as 
in typhoid fever. Subcutaneous injections 
of Caffeine or Sparteine should be given be- 
fore the bath when the symptoms are severe, 
so as to counteract the tendency to syncope.

Asafcetida in Abortion. — In cases of abortion, 
small doses of opium frequently disappoint, 
whereas large and repeated doses may prove 
injurious. Asafcetida is recommended by 
Italian obstetricians, and is usually adminis- 
tered in pills containing one and a-half grains, 
though an enema containing the tincture is 
preferred in cases of threatened abortion. 
The drug is most efficacious in reducing the 
haemorrhage which is prone to appear subse- 
quently; even with a very severe and alarm- 
ing onset the first dose appears to exert a 
most tranquillizing effect, and leads to a

No unpleasant symptoms are produced, but.

lust Forms &lt;&gt;/ Quinine. — The Socilte* de 
Therapeutique recently appointed MM 
Adrian, Bardet, Berlioi and Boymond a com- 
mittee to report nn the above question. They 
conclude that the best salt is the hydrochlo- 
it being the richest in alkaloid, suffi- 
ciently soluble, and less irritating to the stom- 
ach than the sulphate. The hydrobromate 
should be used only in cases rebellious to the 
hydrochlorate. As to the pharmaceutical 
form in which the hydrochlorate should be 
administered, compressed preparations are 
condemned, and pills made up with a soluble 
excipient or soft elastic gelatin capsules are 
recommended. Pills or capsules containing 
each fifteen centigrammes of the hydrochlo- 
rate, and given one in the morning and one 
at night, or else before meals, suffice to keep 
the system under the influence of quinine so 
as to ward off attacks of malarial fever. — 
The Lancet (London). 



Chlorofortn in Tetanus. — P. A. Preobrajen- 
sky relates four cases of acute tetanus treated 
by Chloroform inhalations which were re- 
peated from one to three times a day, the 
daily dose of the drug varying from two to 
four drachms. In addition, hot baths and 
subcutaneous injections of morphine were 
occasionally employed. Three of the patients 
recovered; one succumbed from supervening 
catarrhal pneumonia on the seventeenth day 
of the primary disease. In all the cases the 
inhalations induced muscular relaxation, while 
the breathing became deep and regular, and 
the pulse stronger and slower. The patients 
could be fed during the early stage of the 
narcosis, which also secured a quiet sleep of 
several hours' duration. — Vratchebnyia Za~ 
pisky. 



Fistula in A no. — Surgeons in all ages have 
tried to relieve fistula by means of plasters, 
salves, ligatures, and other methods, rather 
than by the knife; indeed it is only recently 
the latter has taken its place as the only 
certain measure available. The method of 
application is: The sphincter is stretched, the 
rectum cleansed with a bichloride solution, 



and the fistula opened up by straight so- 
after removal of all unhealthy tissues the 
opening should be dosed by a single row of 
CatgUt suture- I, by mea irved 

entirely beneath and around the 
wound. By tins method I have never I 
to cause the bottom of the wound to unite. — 
roa Cook, in Mathet '■' . aJ Qmar 
terly. 



&lt;&gt;t in Night Sweats. — The night - 
o( consumptives I believe are not simply due 
to fever, but to some cause that has &gt;et to 
be fully explained. Many remedies have 
been recommended — quinine, acetate of lead, 
atropine, hyoscine, muscarine, brandy, rub- 
bing the body before sleep, etc., etc. — all of 
which have been found wanting. Consider- 
ing the part probably played by the 
motor nerves, 1 determined to try the I 
of Fluid Extract of Ergot, in doses of Uvt 
minims each, just before bedtime; and the 
result was that the cases were very few in 
which the remedy was useless. Latterly I 
have employed subcutaneously with equally 
good effect. — Doctor Goldenbach, in 
Deutsche Medicinische IVochenschri/t. 



Chloroform. — V. G. Stadnitzky carried out 
a series of elaborate experiments on seven 
healthy young men in order to study the in- 
fluence of this agent, when administered in- 
ternally, on the gastric functions. In each 
instance the experiment lasted fourteen days, 
being divided into two equally long stages, 
during the second of which the subject was 
given from three to ten minims (with water) 
three times daily. The conclusion is to the 
effect that Chloroform markedly improv 
the functions of the stomach, which fact sug- 
gests that it may prove most valuable in the 
treatment of gastric disturbances and, before 
all, in dyspepsia. — Vratch. 



Quebracho. — This drng is the digitalis of 
the lungs— it is an active stimulant to the 
respiratory centres, but in an overdose will 
paralyze the respiration. It is directly indi- 
cated in all forms of dyspnoea, whether of 
asthmatic, cardiac, or nervous origin. Where 
there is a sense of suffocation with cyai 
it is speedy and satisfactory in its action In 
the dyspnoea of croup it will give relief and 
may sustain the respirations until the ob- 
stacles are removed. The dose of the fluid 
extract is from fifteen to forty minims, and of 
the alkaloid Aspidosperminc from one-eighth 
to one-half a grain. — Medical Times.

Hczmophilia. — Among the various remedies 
employed in this malady, which is so difficult 
of management, and for which all treatment 
is so often useless, Calcium Chloride is well 
worthy of trial, as it is a valuable agent in 
promoting coagulability of the blood. Co- 
caine has also been suggested in the same 
connection, but in order for this drug to be 
successful there must still remain some power 
of contractility in the vessels, for Cocaine 
can only check bleeding by bringing about 
vascular contraction in the area under its in- 
fluence. The relaxation must also be guarded 
against. — Polyclinic. 



Excoriations from Walking. — The best treat- 
ment for excoriation of the feet as the result 
of prolonged exercise, if of recent date, is the 
application of a few layers of aseptic gauze, 
kept in place by means of a tightly drawn 
strip of linen cloth; this does not interfere 
with walking if the boots of the patient are 
sufficiently large. When the excoriation is 
infected, it is best painted with a two-per- 
cent, solution of silver nitrate before applying 
the dressing. — Vratch. 



Varicose Veins. — Schude, of Hamburg, pro- 
poses a new operation for varicose veins of 
the lower extremities. He makes an incision 
four or five inches below the knee entirely 
around the leg, dividing the skin fascia and 
all the superficial veins down to the fascia 
covering the muscles; the cut ends of the 
veins above and below are then tied with 
catgut and the wound closed. He reports 
thirty or forty cases, with satisfactory results 
in every instance. 



The Topical Value of Bismuth. — The most 
satisfactory remedy as an application in or- 
chitis or swelled testicle is a paste made of 
Subnitrate of Bismuth and water; it relieves 
the pain and burning sensation at once, and 
gradually diminishes the swelling. It is use- 
ful in the burns and scalds of children; also 
as a face ointment (made by being rubbed 
up with rose-water), for sunburn, blistered 
skin, and chafing in the groins. — Doctor W. 
E. Bessie. 



For Sluggish Liver. — 

Q Podophyllin, 3 grains. 

Euonymin (green), 18 grains. 
Belladonna extract, 3 grains. 
Blue mass, 24 grains. 

Make twelve pills; one to be taken at bedtime.

Surgical Shock. — Atropine is the quickest 
and most valuable remedy known in surgical 
shock and those conditions which resemble 
it, as the stage of collapse in cholera and 
cholera infantum. It may be given hypo- 
dermatically, or by mouth in the form of a 
granule dissolved in hot water, one granule 
every ten minutes until the desired action 
occurs. — Exchange. 



Acne. — 

IJ Sublimed sulphur, 7 parts. 
Beta-naphthol, 2 parts. 
Styrax ointment, 2 parts. 
Fresh lard, 50 parts. 

Rub in every night for a week. Omit a week, 
and repeat.

A Pneumonia Specific. — Doctor Vetten rec- 
ommends Iodide of Potassium or Sodium as 
a specific in pneumonia, given in large doses 
during the first twenty four hours following 
the inception of the disease. In most in- 
stances the Sodium salt will be found prefer- 
able, as it is better borne by the stomach. 



For Chilblains. — 

3 Tincture digitalis, 6 parts. 

Thymol, 3 parts. 

Alcohol, 150 parts.

Tertiary Syphilis. — Santi recommends the 
application of Sulphate of Copper to pharyn- 
geal ulcerations of a tertiary syphilitic char- 
acter. He applies- a four-per-cent. solution 
once every day, and pays due attention to 
specific treatment. — Register. 



Dyspnwa.— Quebracho is a very useful rem- 
edy for dyspnoea, even in cases where there is 
degeneration of the cardiac muscles, athero- 
matous arteries, or emphysema. — St. Louis 
Courier of Medicine. 



Cough Remedy. — Doctor Charles E. Page, 
of Boston, declares the best remedy for cough 
he has ever found is a teaspoonful of moder- 
ately hot water taken every time a paroxysm 
comes on. 



Clematis Erecta. — Known also as Virgin's 
Bower, like rhododendron acts upon the tes- 
ticles, and relieves orchitis, even of gonorrhceal 
origin.

influenza. The mortality of influenza - 

to be mainly due to involvement of the lungs, 

the deaths from the virulence of the febrile 
attack and from implication of the digestive 
tmparatively few. These pul- 
monary O fatal not only to 
the young and the aged, but also to adults in 
the prime of life, death generally occurring 
about the tenth day after the onset of the 
attack. 

In t ses of pneumonia occurring in in- 

fluenza, the peculiar smooth aspect of the 
consolidated lung noted by Ribbert has been 
frequently observed in the deaths from r&lt; 
epidemics, alone as well as with associated 
of broncho-pneumonia. The solid lung 
often appears to be composed of a num- 
ber of patches of broncho-pneumonic consol- 
idation, these patches having run together 
and involved the entire lung, suggesting the 
appearance of a confluent broncho-pneumonia 
rather than that of the croupous variety of 
pneumonia. Some lungs, on the other hand, 
the results of ordinary lobular pneu- 
monia, this condition being observed in early 
adult life quite as frequently as in youth or 
old age. Broncho pneumonia, rare under 
ordinary circumstances in an adult, except 
cases of septic origin, is by no means uncom- 
mon as a complication of influenza, but the 
confluent type just referred to is even still 
more common. This is often found in the same 
lung in conjunction with a red hepatization, 
the gray, isolated patches of consolidated lung- 
around a small bronchus contrasting 
very plainly with the uniform red and con- 
gested appearance of the remaining tissue. 
Tnese patches often seem to originate in the 
posterior borders, and thence to spread to the 
apices and sides, so as eventually to involve 
the whoie lobe. In other cases the apices 
are the parts first affected, apical pneumonia 
being more frequent than any other condition 
in influenza. 

In some cases pale patches of broncho- 
pneumonia have been found scattered 
throughout the lung, suggesting at first sight 
tubercle of the miliary type. Under the 
microscope the small bronchi are seen filled 
with fibrinous plugs; the cells lining the 
bronchi have undergone proliferation, some 
having escaped into the lumen of the tube; 
the alveoli in the neighborhood are crowded 



with catarrhal cells, and ti: -els in 

the surrounding tissue are dilated and 
crowded with of which ap- 

pear to have escaped from t! &lt; walls 

into the pulmonic substam i itches 

are distinct around each bronchiole, but run 
into one another at the periphery The 
tribution is thus broncho-pneumonic, while 
t KUdatioo resembles that 
met with in lobar pneumonia. Asinbroo 
pneumonia, the localized pa rosolij 

datum are accompanied with o &gt;f the 

neighboring lung-tissue, due to a similar 
. viz., the blocking up of the bronchioles 
with exudation and the consequent removal 
of the air from the alveoli in communis 
with the bronchioles at fault. 

ilized patches of pleurisy, characterized 

by adherence of the pleural sur each 

other by means of recent lymph, are also fre- 
quently present, and arise from an extension 
of the inflammation from the superficial 
patches of consolidated lung-tissue. 1'leural 
effusion is rare, not one case being found | 
among the records of post-mortem examina- 
tions at St. George's Hospital during the re- 
cent epidemics of influenza. 

Besides the capillary bronchitis, which 
generally terminates fatally, inflammation of 
the larger tubes is very common. The 
bronchi are found to be congested, their 
inner walls often being covered with thick, 
tenacious mucus; as a rule, the larger tubes 
are not so deeply congested as the smaller 
ones. They are usually filled with muco-pus, 
and in some cases are so distended with purih- 
lent secretion that on being cut across they 
look exactly like small abscesses, varying 
from the size of a pea to that of a pin's head. 
The whole thickness of the bronchial wall is 
considerably softened, accounting for the 
dilatation of the tubes so often present. Oc- 
casionally the walls are so dilated that a con- 
dition of acute bronchiectasis is simulated. 
The dilatation involves the whole length of 
the tube, but more markedly its terminatio 
being thus of the cylindrical variety. Clini- 
cally, however, the typical symptoms of bron- 
chiectasis are not manifested, though th&lt; 
expectoration may be very profuse. The 
contents of the tubes are not always muco- 
purulent in character, but are sometimes 
quite fibrinous or membranous. 

In most cases there is present not one of 
the conditions just described, but a number 
of them. One lobe may be in a state of solid, 
gray hepatization, another may be studded 
with disseminated patches of consolidation 
of varying sizes, while at the same time the 
bronchial tubes may present any of the mor- 
bid conditions above noted. — Practitioner.

Improved Method of Lavage. — A very 
simple improvement in apparatus for wash- 
ing out the stomach is described by Doctor 
W. Beattie Nesbitt, in the Archives of Pedi- 
atrics. The fluid is obtained, as usual, from 
a siphon bottle placed above the level of the 
patient, but the india-rubber tube from this 
bottle is connected with the stomach catheter, 
not by a piece of straight glass tubing, but 
by a glass tube shaped like a widely open 
tuning fork; the handle of the tuning fork is 
connected with the stomach catheter, one 
limb with the tube from the bottle, and the 
other with a waste tube conducted into a 
suitable receptacle. It is convenient to have 
the tube from the bottle and the catheter of 
red rubber, and the waste tube of black rub- 
ber. The tubes from the two limbs are 
placed over the forefinger of the right hand, 
and are held loosely in the palm; either can 
then be easily compressed by the thumb. 
When it is desired to fill the stomach, the 
catheter having been introduced, the waste 
tube is compressed, and the fluid readily 
flows into the stomach from the bottle; when 
the stomach is to be emptied, the red or 
siphon tube is compressed and the black re- 
leased. If the eye of the catheter becomes 
blocked, as often occurs, the current is easily 
reversed by compressing the black and re- 
leasing the red tube. Doctor Nesbitt recom- 
mends the use of a mouth gag, and, after 
inserting the tube, places the child on its 
side, with the face slightly downward. Be- 
fore removing the catheter the stomach is 
filled quite full. An act of vomiting gener- 
ally follows the withdrawal of the tube, or if 

. not it may be excited by titillating the fauces. 

j "In this way," writes Doctor Nesbitt, "I 
have often removed large pieces of coagu- 
lated putrid casein, half an inch to an inch 
in length, of such a tough leathery consist- 

t ence that no amount of washing would have 
broken them up." — Journal of the American 
Medical Association. 



One Reason for the Preponderance of 
Nervous Diseases. — One of the principal 
reasons, in my opinion, for the enormous in- 
crease of nervous diseases, is to be found in 
the management and rearing of the infant as 
now and for some time past practiced, espe- 
cially in the average American families. 

It is almost a universal fact that from the 
hour of its birth to the hour of its maturity 
:he American human infant is constantly 
subjected to a course of stimulation, so far 
is the nerve centres are concerned. The 
roung parents, and the older ones, as well as 
he grandparents and uncles and aunts, are 



each and all so anxious to have the baby a 
smart, 'cute little thing, that every device 
that can be thought of is resorted to in order 
to stimulate the child's mental faculties and 
to have it notice objects as soon as possible; 
and here let me say that I really believe in 
some instances they have succeeded in devel- 
oping that faculty as early as the first few 
days of life. As it grows older, it is urged 
by every means known to humanity to talk, 
to give expression to its thoughts in any pos- 
sible way or form; and by the time such an 
infant is four or five years old its nerve cen- 
tres have been so fearfully developed and 
overstimulated that it is quite possible for it 
to give expression to opinions and ideas 
which would compare favorably with those 
of maturity. This condition of things is 
made to ramify every channel of life which 
it is possible to bring before the infant; and 
such conditions are continued until the child 
degenerates into hopeless lunacy from over- 
stimulation, or else "becomes its own mas- 
ter," as the saying is. When such an infant 
has reached its majority and maturity, it 
usually comes before the world with a nerv- 
ous system already wrecked by having been 
overstimulated and developed, and therefore 
unable to stand the strain usually demanded 
from a healthy, well balanced system. — A. M. 
Beers, M.D., in Columbus Medical Journal. 



Ether and Albuminuria. — If etheriza- 
tion has still determined opponents, it is be- 
cause the careful study of this method of 
anaesthesia has often been somewhat neg- 
lected, and because, on account of some real 
inconveniences of the method, too much 
stress has been laid on observations of little 
value. 

Certain American surgeons have main- 
tained that ether exercises an unfavorable 
action on the kidneys, but this opinion is not 
very well founded. In order to determine 
the alleged relation of cause and effect be- 
tween etherization and albuminuria, I anal- 
yzed the urine of persons who had been 
operated on, before and twenty-four hours 
after the operation. Out of a hundred and 
fifty cases, albumen was found after the 
operation in four only, in two of which there 
had been signs of albuminuria before the 
operation and the quantity of albumen had 
not increased under the influence of the 
ether. With regard to the two cases where 
albumen did not manifest itself until after 
the operation, one of the patients had been 
subjected to laparotomy for intestinal occlu- 
sion, after having been for three days in a 
condition of extreme prostration, and died on

Resection «&gt;f -hi Rectum. — Zancarol 

Is four successful instances of Kraske'&gt; 
operation performed for cancer of rectum 
and cancer of both rectum and vagina. In 
he peritoneal cavity was opened without 
bad result. In each case the wound sup- 
purated, and the sutures fixing the divided 
end of the intestine to the skin gave way. 
The average period within which cicatriza- 
tion was completed was forty-five days. The 
patients increased considerably in weight 
after operation, and all were discharged in a 
very satisfactory state of health. Up to date 
no relapse had occurred after respective in- 
tervals of eighteen, six, four, and two months. 
None of these patients, it is particularly 
pointed out, suffered at the time of their dis- 
charge from faecal incontinence, and all were 
able to control their evacuations. This is 
the more remarkable as in each case it was 
found necessary to remove almost the whole 
of the sphincters. In the discussion on this 
record, Quenu stated that after resection of 
the rectum there is usually incontinence for 
a time, but that the patient gradually regains 
the power of retaining the faeces. This is 
due not to retention of any portion of the 
sphincter, but to increased activity of the 
spe&lt; ial muscular fibres of the intestine, ac- 
quired function thus creating a new organ. —

rivE Power of the Vagina.— Re-

various conditions of health and disease. 
Iodide of potassium is easily absorbed; if a 
tampon soaked with a twenty-per-cent. solu- 
tion be introduced into the vagina, iodine 
can be found in the urine in an hour — the 
excretion reaches its maximum in twenty 
hours and ceases in forty eight hour-. I

TYPHOID=nALARIAL REHITTENT FEVER. 

BY DOCTOR JOAO VINCENTE TORRES HOMEM.* 

{Continued from page i6y.) 

Case 1. — Avelino, mulatto slave, 28 years 
old and of good physique, entered the Santa 
Izabel ward on the 23d of August, 1869. 
Had attacks of intermittent fever a month 
before, without taking any quinine; took 
only a purgative of citrate of magnesia on 
the 15th, which produced great relief, as 
the symptoms reappeared only on the 20th. 
On the night of the 22d, after a chill of short 
duration, had fever and was slightly deliri- 
ous. On the morning of the 23d the fever 
:ontinued, very high; patient very apathetic 
:o all surroundings, and answered questions 
vith difficulty. In this condition he was sent 
[it 3 p.m. to the hospital. The interne on duty 
prescribed sixty grammes of castor oil, which 
produced four evacuations; and sixty centi- 
grammes of quinine muriate, given at 7 a.m. 
&gt;f the 24th, were immmediately vomited up. 
t Condition: Dorsal decubitus; face stupid; 
pathetic, responses very slow and difficult; 
lovements difficult; prostration of strength; 
imperature very high, pulse 120 and small; 
mgue moist and excessively furred; intense 
'lirst and anorexia; liver two fingers' breadth 
*yond border of ribs, very sensitive to pal- 
ition and percussion; spleen increased in 
ze; no abdominal tympanites; pain and 
lrgling in right iliac fossa; urine scanty 
J.id red, no albumen; some cough; no ab- 
&gt;rmal sounds in respiratory organs; insom- 
Jii; some subdelirium. 
Prescribed an emetic of infusion of ipecac 
1 th powdered ipecac; also: 

B Quinine, 2 grammes. 

Sydenham's laudanum, 12 drops. 
Syrup of orange-peel, 30 grammes. 
Water acidulated with sulphuric acid, 120 
grammes. 
To take two tablespoonfuls every hour, after 
o ration of emetic. 



/Translated by Surgeon Geo. P. Bradley, U. S. 
K v. 



Likewise gave a purgative enema; sulphuric 
lemonade as beverage; two chicken broths. 

25th: Patient vomited freely from ipecac; 
had two large stools. Took the mixture up 
to 7 p.m., when it was finished. General con- 
dition entirely different; face more intelli- 
gent, movements more easy, answers more 
prompt, but required to be spoken to loudly, 
as he was deaf; complained of ringing in 
ears; appeared to hear noise of waterfall at a 
distance; tongue slightly coated, belly pain- 
less, liver and spleen less enlarged; still some 
gurgling in right iliac fossa, but without pain,; 
urine more abundant, but still red. Tem- 
perature of skin much less elevated; pulse 
88 and fuller. The difference noted in the 
patient is extraordinary. Ordered mixture 
of quinine continued, with dose reduced to 
twelve decigrammes; lemonade also con- 
tinued; three chicken broths. 

26th: Patient sat up in bed conversing 
with the students and completely apyretic. 
Complained only of deafness and some audi- 
tory symptoms as the evening before. Had 
appetite and begged for food; tongue large 
and moist, only slightly coated at base; liver 
a little enlarged; spleen normal; cough in- 
creased; auscultation of chest revealed the 
presence of some mucous rales scattered 
through both lungs. Continued quinine mix- 
ture, with dose reduced to sixty centi- 
grammes; friction with tincture of iodine to 
right hypochondrium; two chicken broths 
and two soups. 

On the 27th the patient was still taking 
sixty centigrammes of quinine; on the 28th 
and 29th took thirty centigrammes, and used 
an infusion of polygala with syrup of tolu on 
account of slight remaining bronchitis. 

The diet was gradually made fuller and 
more nutritious, and he was discharged on 
the 3d of September, perfectly cured. 

Case 2. — Pedro Murati, Italian, bootblack, 
40 years old, eight months in Brazil, living in 
a tavern on the Rua dos Invalidos, was at- 
tacked by a chill and fever on June nth, 
1873, at 3 p.m. He was without treatment 
till the morning of the 13th, when he entered 
the Mizericordia Hospital and was assigned 
a bed in the Santa Izabel ward. He reported

15th; Patient in excellent condition. The 
evening before, at five o'clock, he was com-

proper to give him sixty centigrammes more 
of quinine. A pyrexia continued at visiting- 
hour; he was very comfortable; asked for 
food; complained of some deafness and ring- 
ing in the ears; liver almost normal in

by SUbdelirium and drowsiness prevented ar

without albumen; examination of chest \ 
made with great difficulty, on account

five centigrammes of calomel in three 1 
200 grammes of infusion of chamomile

The leeches had drawn well, but the blist 
had not been sufficiently effective.

by one and a third grammes of quinine in 
two doses; same enema and fomentation; 
favor suppuration of blisters by use of basili- 
con ointment. 

19th: Face more animated and expressive; 
movements easier; answered questions more 
promptly; there was some subdelirium during 
the preceding night. The saline purgative 
produced four large stools, and the first 
dose of quinine was given at 4 p.m., the 
second at 7 p.m. Temperature 102. 6°; pulse 
92; tongue still dry; liver less enlarged and 
less sensitive to palpation and percussion. 
Abdominal meteorism and pain in right 
iliac region had ceased, though the gurgling 
still continued. Ordered sixty centigrammes 
of quinine at 9 a.m., and tablespoonful doses 
every hour from noon on of a mixture of 
one gramme of same in 100 grammes fluid; 
decoction of Triticum repens, barely contain- 
ing two grammes of nitre, as beverage; same 
enema and same fomentation; two chicken 
broths. 

On the 20th the patient showed great im- 
provement; the face had completely lost its 
typhoid aspect; intellectual faculties per- 
fectly sound; sleep the previous night pro- 
longed and calm; two evacuations, one 
excited by. enema; profuse diuresis; urine 
loaded with urates and chlorides; tempera- 
ture ico. 8°; pulse &amp;6; tongue moist and 
slightly coated; appetite, patient asking for 
! food. The liver still below the border of the 
ribs, but above at the level of the sixth rib; 
spleen still enlarged; belly soft and painless; 
I no gurgling in right iliac fossa. Ordered one 
gramme of quinine; Agua de Inglaterra, half 
a glass every two hours; continued the ni- 
trated ptisan; discontinued enema and fomen- 
tation; dressed blisters with simple cerate; 
idirected three mutton broths and half a cup 
•of coffee. 

On the 21st and 22d the patient took sixty 
1 centigrammes of quinine, on the 23d and 
I 24th thirty centigrammes. Continued use of 
the Agua de Inglaterra to this latter date, and 
i (nourishment was increased. He was now 
[Convalescent, having only a certain degree 
I Df cachexia due to the malarial poisoning to 
■ which he had been long exposed, and which 
;vas anterior to the acute disease that brought 
lim to the hospital. By reason of this ca- 
chexia, and the congestion of the liver and 
;pleen which accompanied it, he remained in 
he ward fifteen days longer, using tonics and 
Preparations of iron, and rubbing the hepatic 
egion every day with tincture of iodine. 

In order that the course followed by ty- 
&gt;hoid-malarial remittent fever in the three 
ases just reported may be compared with 



that of genuine typhoid fever — the dothen 
enteritis of Bretonneau — observed in the same 
ward, I present here two cases, by which it 
will be clearly seen that despite the regular 
quotidian paroxysms the pyrexia was not of 
malarial basis; inasmuch as, in the first in- 
stance, recovery took place many days after 
quinine (which had produced no favorable 
modification in the evolution of the symp- 
toms) had been abandoned; and in the second 
instance the patient died at the end of the 
second week with the gravest symptoms of 
ataxo- adynamia, autopsy revealing all the an- 
atomo-pathological characters of ileo-typhus 
(abdominal typhus). 

Following these cases of true typhoid, I 
shall present two more of typhoid-malarial 
remittent in which the patients died. It will 
be seen by reading the autopsy that both cases 
were, as I had supposed, of a malarial affec- 
tion and not typhoid fever. These four cases 
will complete what I have to say concerning 
the differences between the two pyrexias, 
and will emphasize the considerations found 
in the section devoted to diagnosis; they will 
fill up any hiatus which might perhaps have 
existed, and they express the practical reality 
more precisely and more eloquently than any 
general description could do. 

Case 4. — Joao Pedro de Alcantara, mulatto, 
aged 35, cabinet-maker, residing in the Rua 
de Ajuda, was seized with a paroxysm of 
fever on the 1st of May, 1873, characterized 
by severe chill, fever, and profuse sweat. 
This paroxysm occurred at 2 p.m. and termi- 
nated at 9 p.m. The next morning he ex- 
perienced nothing worse than loss of appetite 
and a bitter taste in the mouth, and went to 
his shop. At 2 p.m. the paroxysm recurred, 
characterized like the preceding one, together 
with very intense headache, which terminated 
at n.30 p.m. The third morning, although 
free from fever, he had heaviness of the head, 
pains in the legs, and prostration of strength. 
In this condition he consulted an apothecary, 
who gave him a dose of quinine and a bottle 
of lemonade. Despite these remedies the 
paroxysm returned at noon, and at 5 p.m. the 
patient came to the hospital. The physician 
on duty prescribed a purgative of castor oil, 
and one gramme muriate of quinine, to be 
taken after action of oil. This attack ended 
with copious perspiration at six o'clock of the 
morning of the 4th. It was on this day at 9 
a.m. that I saw the patient for the first time. 

I found his face dejected, great prostration

Case 5. — Fernando Lisboa, Portuguese, 
20 years of age, clerk, thin and weakly, 
had regular and quotidian paroxysms of 
intermittent fever on the 7th, 8th and 9th of 
j August, 1873. Although seen by a physician, 
[who gave him full doses of quinine, preceded 
j by an emetic, he was much disheartened by 
iseeing the febrile attack reappear at noon of 
the 10th, with even more intensity than the 
others, as it came accompanied by vomiting 
iand very severe pains in the head; it was then 
that he decided to enter the hospital, which 
he did at 7 p.m. of the nth. 

Face indicated prostration and discourage- 
ment; temperature 100. 8°; pulse 86, and 
weak; tongue covered with a very thick coat 
Df yellowish fur; nausea, and vomiting when- 
ever he took water in large amount or broth; 
:hirst; complete anorexia; bowels constipated 
1 [ind a little tympanitic; liver enlarged; spleen 
lormal; urine high-colored and bilious; res- 
piratory organs sound. 

Ordered an emetic of ipecac and anti- 
nony, one gramme of quinine to be taken 
ifter action of emetic. 

i On the 12th the patient vomited consider- 
ably but had only one stool. Took the qui- 
line at 4 p.m. At 6 p.m. the interne found 
iiim with high fever, the temperature being 



105°, and the pulse 122. At 9 a.m. of the 
12th the patient was still febrile (102 ), and 
much prostrated; had not slept at all during 
the night; tongue still very much furred and 
dry at tip; great sensitiveness at epigastrium; 
nausea and much thirst; liver enlarged; urine 
heavily loaded with coloring matter of bile.

doses; forty-five grammes of castor oil two 
hours after second dose of calomel; two 
grammes of quinine in solution with twelve 
drops of laudanum, three doses with two- 
hour intervals, after purgation. 

In spite of five large evacuations and three 
doses of quinine, I found the patient worse 
on the 13th. At 5 p.m. the day before he 
had a temperature of 105. 5 , and high de- 
lirium during the night — tried at various 
times to get out of bed, pretending he was 
well and did not need to stay in hospital. He 
was drowsy, answering questions with much 
difficulty, even when spoken to in a loud 
voice. Axillary temperature 104. i°; pulse 
100 and feeble; tongue completely dry and 
blackened, teeth covered with sordes; still 
great sensitiveness in epigastrium; belly 
tympanitic; pain and gurgling in right iliac 
fossa; spleen enlarged; liver decreased in 
size; urine less bilious; no cough; subcrepi- 
tant rales at base of both lungs. Directed

14th: The patient passed the night restless 
and delirious; at 5 p.m. the axillary tempera- 
ture was 106. 2 ; after the bathing it lowered 
only four-tenths of a degree. I found him in 
dorsal decubitus, with face stupid, eyes half- 
closed, and subdelirium; temperature 105. 2 ; 
pulse 130, very small and feeble; tongue like 
a piece of broiled meat, teeth covered with 
sordes: abdominal tympanites; bowels con- 
stipated; both spleen and liver enlarged; 
acute pain in right iliac fossa, but no gur- 
gling; bronchial rales continued. The urme

On the 21st a very profuse and frequent 
diarrhoea appeared, which caused me to pre- 
scribe a mucilaginous opiate drink. 

Profound adynamia on the 22d, with sub- 
delirium, convulsive tremor of upper limbs, 
carphologia, crucidismus; temperature 104 5 ; 
pulse small, feeble, 120; tongue blackened 
and extremely dry— could not be moved; 
teeth covered with sordes; tympanites and 
diarrhoea; spleen enlarged and liver two 
fingers' breadth below border of ribs; res- 
piration shallow and frequent; no cough; 
sibilant and subcrepitant rales in both lungs. 
At 6 p.m. the patient was comatose, with cold 
extremities, and bathed in clammy sweat; 
axillary temperature 103% and pulse so small 
and frequent that it was impossible to count 
it. At 9 p.m. he died. 

Autopsy made at 10 a.m. on the 23d showed 
&gt;r mortis; leech marks on mastoid pro- 
cesses and epigastrium; marks of blisters on 
thi^h and calves of legs; injection of arach- 
noid and cerebral tissue; no sub-arachnoid 
or intraventricular effusion; congestion of 
base of lungs; catarrh of bronchi; heart 
flabby and softened, a large clot in left

The agminate patches 

well as the isolated glands of r.runner. 

stnted various - of change. At 

points the follicles were turgid, hypertro] 
hard, and resistant to touch; those of Brun- 
ner appeared as small elevatioi ■ -times 

conical, sometimes roundc red indis- 

criminately over the entire circumference of 
the- small intestine. At other points, particu- 
larly in the upper part of the jejunum, the 
patches were covered with a blackish punc- 
tation, resembling in appearance a recently 
shaven beard.* In the lower half of the j 
ileum many ulcerations were observed, of 
various form and aspect; in the upper half 
of this part of the intestine only seven ulcera- 
tions were present, in the jejunum barely 
one, — these ulcerations were oval, elliptical, 
and circular, according to the kind of follicles 
ulcerated, some of great size, others very 
small. In only two had the ulcerative pro- 
cess gone beyond the mucous membrane. 
The ileo-ccecal valve was turgid, red, and 
hardened; the mesenteric glands large, red- | 
dish, and a little softened. Neither the kid- 
neys nor the bladder revealed anything 
abnormal. 

Case 6.— Roberto Garcia, Spaniard, aged 
40, caulker, residing in an inn on the Prahia 
de Ganboa, was attacked by an algid per- 
nicious paroxysm in 1870, for which he w; 
treated in the University Hospital; in 187: 
he had confluent smallpox, for which h&lt; 
was treated in the pest-house. From this 
time on he never enjoyed good health; hac 
a sensation of deep-seated pain in precordial 
region, frequent palpitations of the heart, an&lt;" 
when exercising quickly or ascending staii 
had oppression and dyspnoea. On the 24U 
of June, 1873, in spite of this indispositior 
he took part in a supper given by som&lt; 
friends, and ate and drank to excess. Oi 
the dawn of the 25th he had a severe chill 
and profuse vomiting, rejecting the food h&lt; 
had taken, some of which had not undergon&lt; 
chymification. At 8 a.m. he was much pros- 
trated, with high fever; was seen by a physi- 
cian, who attributed all the symptoms to 
indigestion, and prescribed a purgative of

castor oil, to be followed after operation by 
a mixture containing tinctures of chamomile 
and nux vomica. He felt better after purg- 
ing, but became worse in the afternoon, and 
at night could not sleep — was restless and 
had high fever. His physician then gave a 
sudorific, and on the .26th prescribed some 
pills, which were taken in the afternoon and 
during the 27th without much benefit. On 
the 28th he came to the Mizericordia Hos- 
pital. 

There was great prostration of strength; 
axillary temperature 103. i°; pulse 92; tongue 
furred and dry in the middle; intense thirst 
and anorexia; liver extremely enlarged, 
reaching four fingers' breadth below lower 
edge of ribs; spleen enlarged; the hypo- 
chondria, especially the right, painful on 
palpation and percussion; some abdominal 
tympanites, and bowels constipated; urine 
scanty, red, and albuminous; respiratory 
organs natural. 

Twelve leeches to anus were ordered; six 
wet cups to hepatic region; one gramme of 
calomel in two doses, the second to be fol- 
lowed in three hours by forty-five grammes 
of castor oil; twelve decigrammes of quinine 
in solution in two doses, at three hours' in- 
terval, to be taken after free catharsis. 

On the 29th he was better; had purged 
abundantly; the liver much decreased in 
size, tongue moist, temperature 101.5 , pulse 
90. The urine still contained albumen, but 
in less amount. Cinchona deafness. Ordered 
twelve decigrammes of quinine in solution, 
to be given in two doses, three hours apart; 
decoction of parietaria* and Triticum repens 
with four grammes nitre and eight grammes 
soluble cream of tartar; two chicken broths. 

The patient proved to be in a very grave 
state on the 30th. At 3 p.m. the previous day 
le began to be restless; at five o'clock he 
vas delirious, with tongue dry and tremu- 
lous, temperature 105. 5 , pulse 120. A mix- 
ure was prescribed containing acetate of 
immonia and tinctures of aconite and bella- 
lonna; blisters to calves of legs; enema of 
electuary of senna, asafcetida, and tincture of 
inusk. Next morning at nine o'clock his face 
»as stupid, and intellect abolished: subdeli- 
ium; tongue very dry and tremulous; teeth 
^ry; liver again much enlarged, reaching the 
ame limits inferiorly as on the 28th; spleen 
■ lso enlarged; tympanites; involuntary evac- 
ations, consisting of a bloody fluid of dark 
olor; temperature 104.5 ; pulse 108. Or- 
ered six leeches to each mastoid process; 
ecoction of cinchona, 180 grammes, for two 
nemas; also: 



Wall pellitory — esteemed as a diuretic— Ed.

Tincture musk,. 2 grammes. 

Tincture hyoscyamus, 2 grammes. 

Syrup of orange-peel, 30 grammes. 

Water acidulated with sulphuric acid, 150 
grammes. 
One tablespoonful every hour. 

At 5 p.m. his extremities were cold, though 
the temperature in axilla was 106. 2 ; pulse 
136, small and thready; a profuse hot perspi- 
ration covered his entire body; profound 
coma, attended by stifled and oppressed res- 
piration, indicated but a few moments of life 
remained. He died at 8.30 p.m. 

An autopsy was made on the morning of 
July 1st, and disclosed: Rigor mortis; marks 
of leeches on mastoid processes, of wet cups in 
right hypochondrium, of blisters on calves of 
legs; great turgescence of sinuses of dura 
mater and white matter of brain; hypersemia 
of choroid plexus and velum interpcsitum; 
some effusion of bloody serum in lateral 
ventricles; lungs healthy. Effusion of about 
sixty grammes of serum in pericardium, which 
latter was remarkably thickened and partially 
adherent to heart at points corresponding to 
left ventricle; three very thick, milky patches 
in cardiac layer of same; excentric hypertro- 
phy of both ventricles; thickening of aortic 
valves; thickening and roughening of inner 
tunic of aorta in ascending portion, arch, and 
descending portion, to a finger's breadth be- 
low origin of left subclavian. Liver very 
much enlarged, swollen with blood, friable, 
tearing easily under pressure; spleen much 
increased in size, likewise friable and soft- 
ened; kidneys very congested; stomach al- 
most empty, containing one spoonful of 
yellowish fluid, some redness of mucous 
membrane. The intestines, carefully exam- 
ined from the duodenum to the rectum, pre- 
sented nothing noteworthy excepting some 
injection of the vessels of the mucous mem- 
brane in the duodenum, jejunum, and trans- 
verse colon; in this portion of the large 
intestine a dark, almost black fluid was found, 
evidently bloody, resembling that passed by 
stool in the last hours of life. 

Case 7. — Camillo Ferreira Dos Santos, 
mulatto, 50 years old, cabman, entered the 
Santa Izabel ward August 3d, 1869, with all 
the apparent symptoms of alcoholic cachexia. 
For a long time had been an excessively 
hard drinker — almost always intoxicated. On 
June 28th he was drunk, and slept a great 
part of the day exposed to the sun in the 
Campo da Acclamacos. Was taken home at 
3 p.m., and two hours later experienced a 
severe chill, followed by fever; slept pro- 
foundly all night, and awoke bathed in per- 
spiration. He tried to work on the 29th, but

rales at base of both lungs. 

Prescribed sulphuric lemonade as a bever- 
age; blisters to calves of legs; calomel, sixty 
centigrammes; two grammes of quinine in 
solution, to be taken in three doses. 

The following day there was complete 
apathy, the face being stupid. He lay in 
the dorsal decubitus with eyes half-open, and 
failed, to reply to questions, though now and 
then uttering disconnected words; took long 
and deep inspirations. The night before, 
the interne found him delirious and very hot, 
but temperature was not taken. Tempera- 
ture at 9 a.m. on August 4th was 110 ; pulse 
122. Tongue on its upper surface exhibited 
some longitudinal clefts, whence oozed blood 
that coagulated; the epistaxis had reappeared, 
but on a small scale. Other symptoms con- 
tinued much the same. Ordered muriatic 
lemonade as a beverage; two enemas of de- 
coction of cinchona and tincture of chamo- 
mile; valerianate of quinine, one gramme, 
divided into three doses to be taken two 
hours apart. 

Far from improving, he grew worse from 
day to day. On the 6th, coma supervened, 
lasting till 5 p.m. of the 7th, when death took 
place, preceded by tracheal rales. 

I made use of wine and a diffusible stimu- 
lant mixture in the last two days of the dis- 
ease, without any result. 

The autopsy was made on the morning of 
the 8th, and revealed: Marks of blisters on 
calves of legs; incomplete rigor mortis; note- 
worthy thickening of dura mater and arach- 
noid; anaemic pallor of white substance of

digestion as mechanical trituration; seen 
tions were referred to variation in resistanc&lt; 
of Darts in the vascular system; warmth was 
supposed to be due to friction of the blood- 
corpuscles; health consisted in the undii 
turbed performance of the physical an&lt; 
mechanical processes of the body. Diseas&lt; 
were explained inversely: the blood, und&lt; 
diseased conditions, was held to contaii 
pointed and angular crystals which irritat&lt; 
as they passed through the pores, or dii 
turbed because they could not so pass. 

The first to enunciate these views was 
Santoro, or Sanctorius, who flourished froi 
1 56 1 to 1635, and was for a while pro- 
fessor at Padua. He taught how to investi- 
gate the pulse by an instrument of his owi

contrivance, and how to study the tempera- 
ture by means of a species of thermometer, 
which was probably his own invention. (This 
instrument, by the way, was invented about 
this time; Drebbel (1572-1634) is regarded 
as the inventor of the air thermometer, Gali- 
leo (1574-1642) of the spirit thermometer, 
and Roemer (1644-1710) of the mercurial 
thermometer.) Santoro studied the phenom- 
enon of transpiration and constructed ap- 
paratus for bathing bed-ridden individuals; 
he found that in twenty-four hours the in- 
sensible transpiration through the skin 
amounted to 1% kilogrammes — which result, 
compared with the results of the present day 
determined by the most complete observa- 
tions, is only twenty per cent, too high, and 
proves how accurately he investigated. The 
important role of the perspiration, which he 
pointed out, was made use of by the iatro- 
ehemists to vindicate their terrific sweat 
cures. 

Borelli (1608-1679), of Naples, is usually 
regarded, however, as the founder of the 
iatro-mechanical school. Of a quarrelsome 
disposition, he could not stay long in any 
one place, though he ultimately settled in 
Rome, where he joined the circle of savants 
who gathered around Christina, the daughter 
bf Gustavus Adolphus, who had become a 
:onvert to Catholicism. Finally Borelli en- 
tered a monastery. His services related 
nainly to physiology, where, like Descartes, he 
'ollowed purely mathematical principles; he 
explained the action of the muscles by the laws 
)f the lever, calculated the mechanical work 
lone by the heart, and correctly ascribed in- 
ipiration to muscular action. He was the 
opponent of iatro-chemistry, and claimed 
here was no such thing as corruption of the 
)lood. His pupils and followers — like Bel- 
ini (1643-1704) of Florence, who became 
rofessor in Pisa at the early age of nineteen, 
.nd Baglivi (1668-1707), a pupil of Malpighi 
.nd a man of universal education — carried 
•ut and elaborated the first expressions of 
his author. Borelli was the author of the 
ft-quoted maxim, "He who diagnoses well, 
ures well." 

, The iatro-mathematical system held ground 
or some time in Italy, and also found follow- 
rs elsewhere. For instance, Dodart (1664- 
707), of Paris, explained the voice on the 



mechanical principles enunciated by Borelli 
and Quesnay (1 694-1 774), the first perma- 
nent secretary of the Academy of Surgery in 
Paris. In England this explanation was 
adopted by a number of followers, none of 
whom, however, was eminent enough to jus- 
tify special mention here. In Germany it 
obtained a certain amount of favor, but seems 
not to have attracted any very eminent dis- 
ciples. 

The iatro-mechanical school ran a course 
not unprofitable to science, yet was unfruit- 
ful of real advance in the domain of practical 
medicine. The man of this particular age 
who, more than any other, exerted an influ- 
ence destined to be prolonged even to the 
present time and probably much longer, who 
had a cool, clear, and unprejudiced spirit, 
and who sought the true value of medicine 
and recompense for the same in the benefits 
which it brings to the sick-, without scorning 
or neglecting its scientific side, was Thomas 
Sydenham, born at Winford Eagle in 1624, a 
student at Oxford in 1642, and recipient of a 
bachelor's degree of medicine in 1648. The 
next fifteen years of his life we know practi- 
tically nothing of, save that' he spent some 
time in Montpellier pursuing his medical 
studies. In 1663 he became a member of 
the Royal College of Physicians, but did not 
take his degree of Doctor until 1676, thirteen 
years before his death. His chief work, 
"Medical Observations," is said to have been 
originally written in English and translated 
into Latin; it first appeared in 1666, the year 
when fire and plague devastated London. 
He died of gout in 1689, and was buried in 
Westminster Abbey. During the earliest 
years of the plague in London he fled, as was 
the general custom of that day. 

His model was Hippocrates. In pathology 
he was a humoralist without being a theorist. 
He knew only one standard — observation 
and experience. Sharing the opinions of his 
day, he laid but little weight upon anatomy 
and physiology, yet he recognized their value 
when employed in the production of hypo- 
theses. He conceived of disease as active, 
operative, a natural effort of the body to re- 
move morbid material from the blood; if this 
effort is violent and speedy, we have to do, he 
says, with an acute disease, but if slow and 
difficult the condition is chronic. Fever was

of saliva were discharged daily. As com- 
pared with the therapeutics of that day, his 
were manifestly simple, and yet he empl 
for example, eighteen different herbs in one 
prescription, and that merely an ointment. 
The unreliability of the action of drugs in- 
duced him to rely upon specifics, as did Para- 
celsus, but he acknowledged only one such — 
the then new discovery, cinchona, — not even 
allowing mercury such a position in the treat- 
ment of syphilis. Such drugs as he chose 
were mainly from the vegetable kingdom. 

The great importance of Sydenham and all 
his statements, so far as we are concerned, 
centres about his struggle for the elucidation 
of the healing power of Nature, and for simple 
observation and simpler treatment, as op- 
posed to the overgrown luxuriance of previous 
systems and theories. He became the stand- 
ard-bearer of his age in his return to Hip- 
pocrates' method and art of healing, which are 
founded on the nature of things and on the 
limits of human ability. 

Sydenham was vehemently opposed by 
Richard Morton (1625-164S), of London, 
who, like Fernel, considered all diseases to 
be a poisoning of the vital spirits. Syden- 
ham was also antagonized by Gideon Harvey, 
who ridiculed his medical contemporaries 
without stint, because most of them for febrile 
disease gave cathartics from the second day, 
and began treatment with emetics. With 
delightful satire Harvey divided the physi- 
cians of tie day into six classes: the Ferrea, 
Asinaria, Jesuitica, Aquaria, Laniaria, and 
Stercoraria, according as their favorite sys- 
tems of treatment were the administration of 
iron, asses' milk, cinchona, mineral water, 
venesection, or purgatives.

Among the Italians, Santoro, already spoken 
of as the inventor of various instruments, 
should be mentioned; also Valsalva, who 
obtained a sound reputation as an operator, 
employed the ligature, and recommended 
a starvation plan tor treating aneurism; 
Magati (1579-1647), who contended against 
the abuses of treating wounds by filling them 
with plasters, balsam, poultices, tents, etc., 
and of changing the dressing several times a 
day — once in four days was better, he

professor at Naples, and later an eminei 
surgeon, a good anatomist, and a particuh 
friend of the actual cautery; Marchetti ( 1 5 M 
1673), a bold, versatile operator of Paduj 
and Borri, of Milan ( 1 625—1695), skilled 
an operator and oculist, but better knowi 
because of his sad fate, since he died in the 1 
prison of the Inquisition after a prison life - 
of twenty-five years, on account of too liberal 
religious views. There were also numeroi 
other Italian surgeons who made a nam&lt; 
especially in plastic surgery, and particularl 
in that branch of it named rhinoplasty, bj 
whose efforts one method of manufacturinj 
a new nose came to be known as the " Itali; 
method."

during this century of Richelieu, Ma/.arii 
Louis XIV., Corneille, Racine, Moliere, 
Femelon, La Fontaine, l.oileau, Bossuet, an( 
many other men eminent in literature ai 
science. During this century the French laic 
the foundation for that leadership in surgei 
which they maintained for nearly two ( en- 
turies. Let us mention among their surgeons 
Morel, who invented the tourniquet at the 
siege of Besancon in the year 1674. Thew 
was also Jean Baptiste Denis (who died in

1704), physician to Louis XIV., who per- 
formed the first transfusion of blood in man. 
(Transfusion of the blood of the young into the 
veins of the old, for the purpose of rejuvena- 
tion, was recommended by Libavius in 17 15, 
and Colle of Padua gave it new support by 
describing a method for its performance. In 
1729 Boyle practiced transfusion on dogs. 
The London faculty sought the value of the 
operation after excessive haemorrhage, and 
Edmond King, physician to Charles II. in 
1665, practiced transfusion from vein to vein. 
But Denis was the first to carry out the oper- 
ation with lamb's blood upon a patient sink- 
ing under excessive venesection, an operation 
which was very much abused at this time.) 
It was in this century that the French family 
of lithotomists, the Collots, distinguished 
themselves in their special line. The last 
member of the family, Francois, died in 1706. 
Their specialty must have found at that time 
considerably more material than comes to 
the front to-day. 

Among the general surgeons of France were 
DeMarque (1618), who distinguished himself 
as a bandager; Bienaise, who invented the 
bistoury cache (1601-1631); De Launay 
(1649), monk and lithotomist; Goursaud, who 
survived his century, and who was the first 
;.to describe stercoral incarceration; Duver- 
ney, who demonstrated the growth and nu- 
trition of the bones by periosteum; Lambert, 
who practiced injections in hydrocele; Andry, 
)f Lyons, who wrote of orthopedic surgery and 
)riginated the name orthopedics; Pierre Dionis 
who died in 1718), surgeon to the Empress 
Maria Theresa, famous in his art, and who 
irst emphasized the effects of rickets upon the 
)elvis; and Boulot, better known as Beaulieu 
1671-1714), who advanced himself from be- 
1 ng a soldier and a day laborer to become a 
&gt;hysician, a famous lithotomist and surgeon; 
-he finally joined the Franciscan order, 
vhere he obtained the name of Frere 
acques, under which title ke passed for 
he inventor of lateral lithotomy. Then 
here were Saviard (1656-1702), surgeon-in- 
hief in the Hotel Dieu, who, among other 
hings, determined the seat of hernial stran- 
ulation to be often in the neck of the sac; 
nd Georges Mareschal (1658-1736), surgeon 
3 Louis XIV., one of the founders of the 
academy of Surgery, who has a record of 



eight lithotomies performed in half an hour, 
and who became famous for his services in 
improving the schools of surgery in France. 
" In this (the seventeenth) century also, oph- 
thalmology was much cultivated in France, 
although it was assigned to the despised 
surgeons. Those who won most renown in 
this line were Maitre Jean and Brisseau, who 
divide the honor of first recognizing the seat 
of true cataract. During this period also 
Duverney, professor of anatomy at Paris, was 
the first to systematically describe diseases 
of the ear in accordance with their anatomi- 
cal seat. 

In Spain scholarship sank more rapidly 
during this century than among any other 
people in history, due mainly to the loss of 
their political supremacy and their commerce 
to the Dutch and English, and to the utter 
failure, at home, of their efforts to introduce 
true unity of faith. In these efforts the in- 
dustrious Moors were excluded under Philip 
III. In art they maintained their standing, 
— attaining, in fact, in Murillo, the acme of 
their fame; but in other branches of industry 
they rapidly degenerated. Students of his- 
tory will readily understand how little leisure 
the Spaniards had at this time to devote to 
the cultivation of science, including medicine 
and surgery. Of the two men who are 
mentioned during this century as Spanish 
surgeons, namely, Almeida and Ayala, we 
know practically nothing. 

The Germans gained no such store of 
knowledge from their experience during the 
Thirty Years' War as did the French during 
their campaigns. The barber-surgeons, for 
the most part, still reigned supreme, and their 
guild contained some men of ability and in- 
dependence of thought. The most notable 
man of the times was Fabricius Hildanus 
(1560-1634). Of him, however, I have al- 
ready spoken as belonging rather to the pre- 
vious century. He was the first learned 
German surgeon recognized and esteemed as 
such by his contemporaries. He was distin- 
guished also as an oculist and aurist, and 
removed a particle of iron from the cornea 
by means of a magnet. A man of great op- 
erative genius, and a born surgeon, was Pur- 
mann (1648-17 21), who greatly lamented the 
low condition of surgery in Germany, and 
regarded a knowledge of anatomy as the

The Dutch had but few men during: this 
century who enjoyed any reputation as -

-1719), who, from being a poor boy, became 
a barber, traveled extensively, and was finally 
made professor of anatomy and surgery in 
Leyden, where he introduced the innovation 
of teaching practical surgery upon the ca- 
daver. Me was especially famous as a lithot- 
omist after the method of Frere Jacques, 
although:he did not give ir&gt;struction on this 
subject in his lectures. 

By the way, it is an interesting fact that 
the clinical histories of many operations 
for stone during the seventeenth century 
were related in verse and illustrated with 
plates. Harvey's vivisections were also re- 
lated in verse. 

Now for the first time do we begin to hear 
of Knglish surgeons and English surgery. 
The most prominent, as well as almost the 
earliest, was Richard Wiseman (1595-1686), 
ordinary surgeon of James I., called some- 
times the " Pride of England " and sometimes 
the "Pare o( England" — a bold, judicious 
operator, who took hold of every novelty, 
and who accepted the ligature of Pare 
(always having the actual cautery at hand, in 
case the ligature should fail); he also am- 
putated through sound parts, favored operat- 
ing for strangulated hernia, and employed 
the trephine zealously. The first recorded 
operation for external urethrotomy for the 
relief of stricture is mentioned in Wiseman's 
writings. 

Besides him there were William Cowper 
( 1 666-1 709), a famous anatomist and sur- 
geon; and Woolhouse, a famous but ignorant 
itinerant oculist. Sir Christopher Wren, 
architect of St. Paul's, was the first who de- 
voted attention to injecting medicine into the 
veins— a subject 'Studied again much later, 
and recently once more taken up. His ex- 
ample (in 1667) was followed by others,

Midwifery during the seventeenth centurj 
advanced even more rapidly than its mother- 

^'ien . . The accouchment 

entrusted in man. to the care of 

educated men, who contributed not a little to 
art. Anatomy and physiology contrib-! 
Uted also their quota to a clearer knowledge 
of these diseases. The obstetric forceps 
were for s&lt;» long a time kept secret that they 
were of small benefit at first to the obstetric 
art. Among the French who v eciallj 

prominent as promoters of midwifery mu&lt; 
be mentioned Marguerite de la Marche, chi&lt; 
midwife of the Hotel Dieu; Francois Mauri- 
ceau, president of the College of St &lt; "ine; 
Jules Clement de Lamotte, who was also 
skillful surgeon; and Portale, who first pre 
posed version by one foot. Among the Ger- 
mans a Jew mid wives distinguished themselv&lt; 
as independent observers, most of all Justii 
Siegemundin, daughter of a minister, wl 
devoted herself to midwifery with such sui 
cess that she became court midwife; she re&lt; 
ommended puncture of the membranes f&lt; 
the production of artificial delivery, and es{ 
daily advocated bimanual version. 

But perhaps the most significant advan&lt; 
were made in the direction of studies in anal 
omy, physiology, and pathology. The his 
tory of the circulation we have already taker 
up. After Harvey's time, and largely be 
cause of his researches, physiologists 
divided into two parties with regard to th&lt; 
origin of life. These parties were known 
Animists and Animalculists. It was large 
by the later researches of Highmore ( 
1685) upon the anatomy of the testis and t\ 
epididymis, supplemented by those of Aul 
in Florence concerning the ovaries (whic 
had been previously considered as femal« 
testicles), and the researches of Stenon c&lt; 
cerning the muscular nature of the uterus 
that a better knowledge of reproductioi 
was established. De Graaf (1641-167;,), 
physician of Delft, Holland, pointed ou 
the ovarian follicles, known to-day unde 
his name, while Swammerdam (1637—16? 
studied the comparative anatomy of th&gt;

ovaries — and was, by the way, the first to 
prove that the queen bee is a female. 
Needham, the London anatomist and phy- 
sician, and Hoboken of Utrecht, described 
more accurately the placenta and the cover- 
ings of the ovum. 

Anatomical discoveries crowded along 
about this time. For instance, Wharton 
(1610-1673) discovered the submaxillary 
duct, named after him; Glisson (1647-1671) 
studied the liver and recognized its capsule, 
that still bears his name; Nuck injected the 
lymphatics with quicksilver, and studied the 
glands especially; Stenson discovered the 
excretory duct of the parotid, and Rivinius 
(his name being translated in German Bach- 
mann) found the sublingual duct; Peyer, 
Schafhausen, and Brunner, the latter a pro- 
fessor in Heidelberg, discovered the intesti- 
nal giands which bear their names; Wirsung 
.of Bavaria (who was assassinated in 1643 by 
another physician) discovered in the dissect- 
ing-room of Vesalius, at Padua, the excre- 
tory duct of the pancreas; Pacchioni found 
'the bodies named after him in the dura mater; 
'Havers, of London, discovered the synovial 
glands and the so-called Haversian canals; 
Cowper, already mentioned, discovered the 
small glands named after him, located in 
:front of the prostate, and Bartholin yet other 
glands, in the labia, which bear his name; 
Meibom, professor in Helmstadt, discovered 
';he small glands in the eyelids which are 
lamed after him. Besides these, many other 
iiscoveries might be recorded here, did time 
)ermit. One other, however, deserves to be 
Mentioned, with which the name of Schneider 
1614-1680) must always be honorably con- 
nected. He described the mucous membrane 
&gt;f the nose and demonstrated anatomically 
.nd clinically that not the brain, but this 
aembrane, secretes the mucous discharge 
'uring fluxes from the nose. This over- 
drew at once and forever the ancient doc- 
rine, which included so many and various 
catarrhal " diseases. I might add also that 
he best and most complete description of 
pe entire central nervous system which had 
een given up to this time was furnished by 
r ieussens. 
By the middle and latter portions of the 
iventeenth century most of the better phy- 
cians and surgeons had either assumed 



offices and positions in which they were sup- 
ported by the State, or were settled in per- 
manent residences; which was not the case 
with the mass of physicians in the sixteenth 
century. As a result the reputation of the 
entire profession began to improve, while 
the unlimited license and absolute freedom 
of practice prevailing during the Middle 
Ages were almost entirely done away with. 
By this time the clerical element had disap- 
peared almost entirely from medical circles, 
or only dabbled in certain specialties. The 
Thirty Years' War was fatal to the supremacy 
of the clergy in matters of public health. 
Moreover, the increase of international inter- 
course favored the communication of medical 
knowledge. 

The physicians of this period were more 
occupied with chemistry and physics than 
had ever been the case before. Nevertheless 
this was also the special age of alchemists and 
of impecuniosity. According to one of the 
classifications of the time, the regular profes- 
sion was supposed to include physicians, sur- 
geons, barbers, regimental surgeons, lith- 
otomists, bath-keepers, midwives, nurses, 
apothecaries, druggists, and even confection- 
ers and grocers. Another list of impostors 
and quacks, equally official, was made to in- 
clude old women, village priests, hermits, 
quacks, uroscopists, Paracelsists, Jews, calf- 
doctors, executioners, crystallomansers (a 
class of people — chiefly Italian — who sought 
after crystals), mountebanks, vagrants, magi- 
cians, exorcists, monsters, rat-catchers, jug- 
glers, and gypsies. Veterinary physicians 
were also at that time included in this class. 
Anatomy was now studied more from hu- 
man bodies, and was authorized by statute. 
This was especially the case in non-German 
institutions, to which for this reason students 
flocked in great numbers. In Dresden so 
early as 161 7 there was a dissecting-room in 
which stuffed birds, at that time a great rarity, 
and similar curiosities were preserved. The 
study of anatomy was at a low ebb in Ger- 
many; so that when Rolfink, in 1629, arranged 
at Jena, which was then the most popular 
German university, for two public dissections 
upon executed malefactors, it was considered 
such an event that the very highest author- 
ities were present. But the peasantry took 
such fright at this occurrence that for a long

- later one of a female. In Edinburgh 
an anatomical theatre was first erected in 

in Surgeons' Hall. It is worthy of re- 
mark that anatomical plates, designed to be 
lifted i)(i in la;. Jted even at this period. 

About the middle of this century there arose 
a dispute at the bedside of the Margrave of 
Baden between two learned professors and 
the regular court physician, whether a plaster 
to be applied over the patient's heart should 
be placed in the middle of the chest, accord- 
ing to Galen, or upon the left side. The dis- 
pute was settled by opening before the eyes 
of the noble patient a hog, by means of which 

- demonstrated that as a matter of fact 
the heart of the hog lay on the left side. So 
convinced was His Excellency that he dis- 
missed the ordinary physician, who had held 
a contrary opinion as to the position of a 
nobleman's heart. 

The general barbarity and immorality of 
this century were conspicuous, especially 
among the upper classes, and by its close 
had spread from France, become naturalized 
in both Germany and Italy, and extended 
even to the universities, their professors and 
their students. The life of the latter during 
this period was more vulgar and rude than 
ever before, and almost more so than ever 
since. Pennalism — that is to say, barbarity 
toward junior students — became unbounded, 
so that outbreaks occurred even during lec- 
tures. At last the State authorities were com- 
pelled to interfere. Students' outrages were 
very frequent and often fatal, and their out- 
bursts were disgraceful in the extreme. 

Only in France was instruction in surgery 
well regulated, for this was the only country 
which possessed a proper surgical college. 
Practical instruction was imparted to mid- 
i -in l'aris through a special institution, 
in Germany through the Midwives' Guild; 
the barbers, too, continued to receive instruc- 
tion from their guilds; while instruction in 
pharmacy was given by the master apothe- 
caries, too often dogmatically and even farci- 
cally, serving as objects for the keen satire 
o^ Molirre. The expenses of graduation 



very great, and the CCTI I 

times lasted two d.. 

In another way this same seventr 
century might be characterized as one of 

it for physicians — that 
one during which their position was imp- 
in the eyes of the public and better sup; 
by the State. The physicians proper, the 
"medici puri" were still persons of the pro- 
foundest gravity, with fur-trained robes, 
perukes, canes and SWOrds when matters 
were prosperous, who for their lives would 
do nothing more than write prescriptions in 
formal style, everything else being considered 
beneath their dignity — even as they aft 
England to-day. They demanded to be called 
in every case, however, even though they 
knew nothing about it, claiming that only by 
means of their presence could things cer- 
tainly go right. Nevertheless in dangerous 
cases — for example, during the plague — they 
left the surgeons alone while they look( 
upon the sick through the windows. In spit 
of this, however, they were generally es- 
teemed and often sought for, as well in publi 
as in private. Some of them were supplit 
with large libraries by their patrons 
through theirpositions underthe government, 
and most of them enjoyed moderate prosper-l 
ity. Their pay was for the most part regu- 
lated in accordance with a definite tariff, 
while the State gradually cut down the doc- 
tor's honorarium to the pay of a day laborer. 
During that century a certain physician to a 
countess in Munich received $25 as his an- 
nual stipend. For being present at a post- 
mortem and rendering an opinion thereon 
each physician received $1.75. Surgeons 
who were zealous and eager were alwayf 
highly esteemed; they were often better

extensive travels; but the social emancipatior 
of the surgeons was not completed until tht

presents its added quota of imperishable 
facts, making it still more important than its 
predecessor. We may say that the fifteenth 
century had prepared the way for a reform- 
ing idealism which was the principal charac- 
teristic of the sixteenth; and that in the 
seventeenth century the realistic reaction 
against this same idealism showed itself in 
the Church and the State by struggles against 
constituted authority, and in medical science 
by the domination of inductive philosophy. 
The idealism of the eighteenth century was 
not reformative and humanistic, but revolu- 
tionary and humanitarian. The unsettled 
character of the century's events may be 
charged in some degree to the American and 
French revolutions, with their interpretation 
(and their attempted attainment) of the so- 
called "rights of man." The masses were 
now supposed to be released, and philoso- 
phers created new doctrines which had a 
greater influence upon the times than ever 
had philosophical doctrines before. Rous- 
seau, for instance, aroused a revolution in 
politics and education, and skeptics and 
materialists alike strove for general enlight- 
enment, which was sadly needed. Among 
the higher classes extravagance and im- 
morality prevailed extensively; among the 
lower classes poverty and ignorance. In 
Germany the rulers even sold their subjects, 
as when Hesse- Cassel sold to the English 
1700 mercenary soldiers, and other States 
sold smaller numbers. A criminal code, pub- 
lished in 1769, contained seventeen copper- 
plate engravings illustrating various methods 
, of torture. A physician was always present 
[when torture was inflicted, to see that the 
victim's sufferings were not greater than he 
.could bear. This inhuman mode of eliciting 
.testimony was last practiced in Europe in 
1869, in the Swiss Canton of Zug. Popular 
education was a myth, and the children of 
bondmen were not permitted to learn. No 
wonder the French Revolution was hailed 
with joy along the Rhine, where it swept 
away at once and forever the petty rulers, 
abbots and bishops who were the "blood- 
suckers" of the people. The numerous wars 
,of the century had no great influence upon 
the development of medicine, except in the 
direction of surgery. 

The eighteenth century was revolutionary 



also in the introduction of freedom of re- 
ligious thought, so that clerical physicians 
disappeared entirely from the ranks, save a 
few who officiated as lithotomists like Frere 
Come, or as oculists like Wrabetz, the latter 
of whom was even a professor in Prague. 

This was the century, too, of Leibnitz and 
Kant, of Linnaeus and Lavoisier, as well as of 
Bach, Hayden, Beethoven, and Goethe. Dur- 
ing it the most conspicuous services in nearly 
all branches of learning were rendered by 
the Germans, instead of by the Italians and 
English as during the preceding century. In 
fact, Germany was then at the zenith of her 
glory, and supplied an impulse for all other 
nations. 

The influence of philosophy and the natu- 
ral sciences became also more and more 
marked. At the head of its philosophers 
must be placed Leibnitz (1646-17 16), who 
by his own writings and those of his pupils 
created a philosophical school whose influ- 
ence is still everywhere felt. His doctrine 
was dualistic: Matter is created once for all, 
and has no further need of the Creator. As 
concerns the spiritual world, he assumed 
minute, indivisible, intelligent beings, called 
monads— constituents of all bodies and all 
beings. In close relation with him stood 
Kant, while in England Locke and Hume 
became leaders of the opposed and materi- 
alistic school, declaring the brain to be an 
organ for the secretion of thought. 

Among the universities founded during 
the eighteenth century were those of Breslau, 
1702; Bonn, 1 771; Stuttgart, 1 781 ; Pesth, 
1794; Gottingen, 1737; and Erlangen, 1743. 
Medicine was also cultivated in learned 
societies, which increased constantly in num- 
bers. In 1 744 Frederick the Great united two 
other societies into his Royal Academy. In 
Switzerland, in 1 75 1, was founded an associa- 
tion of physicians and naturalists, while in 
France royal scientific societies were founded 
at Bordeaux, Montpellier, Lyons, and Dijon, 
and the Royal Medical Society of Paris lived 
from 1717 until 1788. In spite of all these 
opportunities for enlightenment, everything 
was not yet enlightened. Then De Haen 
defended the existence of demons, and Maerz, 
a well known theological teacher, in 1760 
devoted a book to witches and magic. That 
witches were burned publicly, is a matter of

history, even in America. So late 
there was a statute regarding witches in Ire- 
land, and they were burned in M I 
recently as But these are Hying pic- 

tures of the eighteenth century, which are 
meant only for the moment to illustrate the 
more serious topic to which we must now ad- 
^&gt; ourselvi - 

First of all, the medical systems and ik 
of tfw cent:;.. Many hundred years previ- 
ously Galen had originated a method which 
ves perhaps the title of pure eclecticism. 
The first purely eclectic system similar to his 
originated with Boerhaave (166S-1738), per- 
haps the most famous physician of his or any 
other century. He was the son of a clergy- 
man near Leyden, Holland, and was one of 
thirteen children. Originally intended for 
the clerical profession, he had studied phil- 
osophy, history, logic, metaphysics, philology, 
mathematics, as well as theology, with great 
diligence. His education was later directed 
to the study of medicine because of the state- 
ment that the purity of certain theological 
doctrines was endangered by him. So he 
studied chemistry and botany, and then 
anatomy and medicine, graduating in 1693. 
He practiced in Leyden with great success, 
and was offered a court position. In 1709 
he was tendered the chair of medicine and 
botany, and in 17 14 that of the practice of 
medicine; in 17 18 he was also made professor 
of chemistry. In all of these positions he 
displayed the greatest capacity. He was a 
clinical teacher of rare talent, and soon ac- 
quired such reputation as to attract to Leyden 
students from all parts of the world, in such 
numbers that no lecture-room in the Univer- 
sity could contain them. He was the first to 
give separate lectures on the subject of 
ophthalmology, and employed the magnify- 
ing glass in examining the eye. As a prac- 
titioner he was no less popular, and he left 
an estate valued at two million dollars. He 
was so famous that when a Chinese official 
addressed a letter "To the Most Famous 
Physician in Europe," it reached him safely. 
He made no distinction in his patients, and 
compelled Peter the Great to wait a whole 
night for his turn to consult him. His most 
eminent pupils were Haller, Van Swieten, 
De Haen, (iaub, and Cullen. 

Boerhaave's influence and dignity, which 



Onishing even in a physician, were 
based no less upon hit attain^ 

ments than upon the benevolence ami purity 
of his character. He Pras free from disputa- 
and vanity, although everywhere 
regarded . acle. His universal n 

Simplicity :s the seal of truth," although 
he never manifested this in his therapeutics. 
He employed the thermometer in the axilla 
in examining his cases, as did the iatro- 
physicistS of the previous century. 

His doctrines did not form a new system, 
but rather a composite of earlier systems. 
He stands also in the anomalous position of 
one who had the whole world at his feet, and 
yet contributed little or nothing which has 
been of essential importance. In fact, his 
peculiar views have been so universally given 
up that they are of only meagre historic in- 
terest. He looked upon disease as a condition 
in which bodily action or natural activities, 
being disturbed or unsettled, could take place 
only with difficulty; the reverse of this, of 
course, constituted good health. Fever he re- 
garded as an effort of Nature to ward off death. 
Digestion was explained, like the circulation, 
upon mechanical principles. In his thera- 
peutics, beside his efforts to sweeten the acid, 
to purify the stomach, to get rid of acridities, 
he made Hippocrates and Sydenham his 
models. His biographers say that his medi- 
cines were less effective than his personal 
appearance. He left many adherents, but no 
school of followers. It must be said, how- 
ever, to his great credit, that while not the 
first to give clinical instruction, he perma- 
nently established a clinical method in teach- 
ing. 

daub (1 705-1780), professor in Leyden 
from 1 73 1, was but little inferior to his master 
Boerhaave in fame as a teacher. He wrote 
the first complete work on the exclusive sub- 
ject of general pathology. In general thera- 
peutics he considered the healing power of 
Nature amply sufficient to remove sickness, 
but attributed this power sometimes to the 
soul and sometimes to the body. 

There arose, naturally, strenuous opposition 
to the views and teachings of Boerhaave, and 
his principal opponent was Stahl (1660-1 734). 
who was one of the most important system- 
atists of any age, a profound thinker and a 
pioneer chemist. He began lecturing in Jena

at once upon his graduation, at the age of 
twenty-five, and moved through two or three 
different university positions until he came to 
Berlin at the age of fifty-six. He was a great 
pietist, of uncouth manners, faithful to his 
laboriously acquired convictions, and bitter 
and relentless against those who could not 
accept them. Indeed, he regarded his con- 
victions as revelations from God. He looked 
upon the success of another as a personal in- 
jury to himself, and from being first a croaker 
he became finally a confirmed misanthrope, 
until he fell into actual melancholia. Pecu- 
niary profit he never sought, and its pursuit he 
scorned. His views were dynamico-organic, 
pietistic, and antagonistic. He regarded the 
soul as the supreme principle, life-giving and 
life-preserving, not to be confounded with 
the spirit; when hindered or obstructed in 
its operation, disease was present. The soul 
governed the organism chiefly by way of the 
circulation; consequently plethora played an 
important role. To get rid of this plethora 
the soul employed either fever or convulsive 
movements; for example, in children plethora 
produces a pressure of blood to the head, 
and by way of compensation the soul pro- 
vides a haemorrhage from the nose. For 
reasons easily appreciated, he regarded bleed- 
ing piles as safety-valves of the utmost im- 
portance. Fever was a salutary effort of the 
soul to preserve the body; this was true even 
of intermittents, and accordingly he never 
gave cinchona. He scorned anatomy and 
physiology, saying, in one place, that medi- 
cine had profited as much by the knowledge 
of the bones in the ear as by a knowledge of 
snow which had fallen ten years previously. 
But Stahl was one of the most eminent chem- 
ists of the age, and did a great deal to liberate 
chemistry from the glamor of alchemy and 
the domination of pharmacy, and to trans- 
| form it into an independent science. 

Stahl's doctrine has been called Animism, 
and was a reaction against the chemical and 
mechanical theories of the seventeenth cen- 
tury. He gained a considerable number of 
followers, the most notable of them among 
the French being Sauvages (i 706-1 767), the 
forerunner of Pinel and an opponent of pure 
mechanics, who animated the mechanical 
system of the body with Stahl's "soul." 
This was, par excellence, the age of artificial 



systems, and so Sauvages in his classification 
supplied a system which had ten classes of 
diseases, each of which had several orders, 
and some as many as 295 genera and 2,400 
species of disease!! Even Linnaeus had 325 
genera of disease, while Cullen had only four 
classes with 149 genera. 

The Mechanico-dynamic system was a sort 
of compromise or mixed system, which was 
held in high honor by the most eminent phy- 
sicians and better minds of the last century, 
and has even been prized by Sprengel as the 
best of all. It was originated by Friedrich 
Hoffmann (1660-1742). Hoffmann's father 
was a physician, and he was himself born in 
Halle, whose university he attended. He 
acquired lasting reputation as an oculist, and 
was made professor of anatomy, surgery, 
medicine, physics and chemistry at his alma 
mater. Our commonplace " Hoffmann's ano- 
dyne" is named after him. He was one of 
the most erudite professors of his day, more 
easily understood than Stahl, widely known 
for his fluent diction and amiable temper, 
and accordingly won great renown for his 
university. His good fortune as a practi- 
tioner was so great that even Boerhaave de- 
clared him his own equal. As a writer he 
was voluminous, one edition of his works com- 
prising twenty-seven large volumes. 

According to Hoffmann's views, life was 
simply mechanical movement, especially of 
the heart; death the cessation of heart action, 
putrefaction thereupon resulting. Health 
meant regularity of movements; disease, a 
disturbance of the same. He used the word 
"tonus" extensively. Ether he regarded as 
an important factor, producing and main- 
taining movements of the body, itself ex- 
tremely volatile, corresponding largely to the 
"pneuma" of the ancients — it was, in fact, a 
motor principle and at the same time the per- 
ceptive soul. Ether was stored in the 
medulla, and circulated in a double way in 
the body; spasm was the consequence of too 
strong, atony of too feeble, influx of ether. 
Fever was a general spasm of the arteries 
and veins, having its cause in the spinal cord. 
Hoffmann's therapeutics were simple, and 
poor in drugs. These latter were intended to 
weaken, alter, or evacuate, and he was espe- 
cially partial to the use of vinous remedies. 
The strong and toxic drugs he used but little.

this way Cullen was enabled to graduate in 
1740. Six years later he taught chemistry in 
Glasgow, and in ten years more came to Edin- 
burgh as professor of medicine. He continued 
very active and famous up to the time of his 
death, but died as he had been born, in 
poverty. Among his numerous other chari- 
table deeds he supported the widow of 
Robert Burns and published the latter's 
poems 

Cullen was the father of modern Solidism, 
a system based upon the solid parts of the 
body, the nerves being the chief agents. The 
life-giving element was, in his view, an un- 
defined dynamic something (different from 
Hoffmann's ether or Stahl's soul) which he 
called nerve force or nerve principle, animal 
force, and brain energy, and in it he included 
the spinal cord. His nerve principle was 
supposed to produce spasms and atony, either 
actively or passively. The causes of disease, 
while of a debilitating character, were sup- 
posed to awaken reaction of the healing 
powers of Nature; fever was a reparative 
effort of Nature, even in its cold stage, the 
blood playing no part in it. He constructed 
a very arbitrary classification of fevers, as, in 
fact, he did of all diseases, his system of 
nosology being the secret of his reputation. 
His explanation of gout was famous: that 
disorder, he said, depended upon an atony 
in the digestive organs against which was 
periodically set up a reparative effort in form 
of a joint inflammation. In scrofula he had 
to assume, in contradiction to his nervous 
pathology, a peculiar acridity, and in putrid 
fever a putridity of the humors of the body. 
His therapeutics were simple and salutary, 
because of his renunciation of venesection, 
which was much abused in his day. 

The most celebrated pupils and successors 
of Hoffmann were Gregory of Kdinburgh,

Sydenham and Boerha ted in 

-calk-d ( )ld Vienna Sahool, whose con- 
nection with the lives of Maria Theresa and 
Joseph II. deserves at least mention. Its 
founder was Baron Van Swieten (1700-1773), 
of Leyden, a descendant of a noble Jansenist 
family of the Netherlands, who graduated 
under Boerhaave after having studied at Lou- 
vain. After the death of his patron he was 
called to the assistance of the Archduchess, 
Maria Anna of Austria, who was suffering 
from an abortion, and gave such satisfaction 
that she recommended him to her sister 
Maria Theresa, who up to this time had re- 
mained sterile. To her and to her husband 
he gave advice which resulted in sixteen suc- 
cessive pregnancies, and then, as the result 
of his success, came to Vienna in 1745 as 
president of the General Medical Department 
of Austria. He was also made censor, in 
which position he incurred the enmity espe- 
cially of the Jesuits and of Voltaire, whom he 
robbed of their influence. He was made 
baron, and became, next to Kaunitz, the most 
influential counselor of the Empress. His 
chief care was dedicated to the elevation of 
medical affairs in Austria, and especially to 
the improvement of the medical faculty. He 
had just seen success crown his efforts when 
he died of senile gangrene, with the reputa- 
tion of being a great physician and benefac- 
tor of the poor. One of the greatest of his 
services was improving the treatment of 
syphilis, in which he, after the example of 
Paracelsus, recommended the internal use of 
corrosive sublimate. 

More eminent as a physician than for per- 
sonal character was De Haen (1704-17 76), 
of The Hague, a pupil of Boerhaave. At 
the suggestion of Van Swieten, he was called 
in 1754 to Vienna as president of the clinic 
of the city hospital, which at that time af- 
forded accommodation for only twelve pa- 
tients. He was the real founder of the 
so-called Old Vienna School, whose merit, in 
contrast to the so-called new school, is to be 
sought in practical and diagnostic services. 






THE MEDICAL AGE. 



211 



As De Haen quarreled with every one, he 
also did with Stoerck (i 749-1803), the suc- 
cessor of Van Swieten in the direction of the 
Austrian Medical Department, and with Stoll 
(1742-1787), a clinical teacher who was espe- 
cially famous as an epidemiologist. 

Stoll lectured with great popularity until 
1784, upon the completion of the Allgemeines 
Krankenhaus, when he fell into the back- 
ground and was badly treated. He was the 
subject of numerous intrigues by his enemies, 
and had a wife who embittered his life, and 
who even had him buried in the dress of a 
Jesuit in order to injure his reputation after 
his death. To his credit be it said that, 
changing his views of the constituents of dis- 
ease, later in life, and his original therapeu- 
tics becoming no longer of use to him, he 
abandoned them entirely. Nevertheless his 
therapeutic system flourished for a long time 
after him. 

There were in vogue during this period 
numerous other doctrines, some of which 
were too puerile or insubstantial to gain any 
foothold at all; others exerted a certain 
amount of influence during the lifetime of 
their originators or for a generation after- 
ward. With many of these I do not care in 
any way to deal. A few others, I think, 
ought to be at least mentioned in such a his- 
tory as I am endeavoring to give you. 

There was another Hoffmann — Christopher 
Ludwig Hoffmann (1 721-1807), of Westphalia, 
who devised a so-called humoral theory in 
which the "acridities" of Boerhaave were 
mingled with the "putridities" of the pneu- 
manists and the "irritability" of Glisson. 
His treatment and remedies for diseases were 
supposed to be antiseptic, as was very proper 
when dealing with putridities. 

The theory known as the "Doctrine of In- 
farctus" had its origin with Kampf, who died 
in 1753. By infarctus, Kampf understood 
impacted faeces, which he thought originated 
in the humors of the body, portal vessels, 
and intestines; he recognized two kinds, the 
black bilious and the mucous. From this 
theory a widespread clyster fashion devel- 
oped, and lords and ladies vied with each 
other in belaboring their infarcti and in ad- 
ministering enemas. As Baas says: "We 
cannot deny to the author of this doctrine at 
least an extensive knowledge of human 



nature. He supplied a universal remedial 
procedure, and gratified the apothecaries 
with the bulkiness of the herbs required for 
its practice." 

Quite antagonistic to the views of the 
Vienna School were those of the School 
of Montpellier, inaugurated by Bordeu (1732 
-1796) and generally known as Vitalism. 
Bordeu died in the enjoyment of great 
reputation, but at variance with all his col- 
leagues. He maintained the existence of 
a general life of the body, a composite life, 
resulting from the harmonious working of 
the individual lives and powers of all the 
organs, which were supposed to be associated 
with each other but each for its own definite 
function; the most important organs — the 
stomach, heart, and brain — being called " the 
tripod of life." In pathology he laid great 
weight upon crises, which were supposed to 
proceed from the glands. 

The most important representative of vital- 
ism was Barthez (1 734-1806), of Montpellier, 
a man of great gifts and eager for knowl- 
edge. He recognized a vital principle as the 
cause of the phenomena of life, but acknowl- 
edged that its nature was unknown, although 
he endowed it with motion and sensibility 
different from a thinking mind. Plants were 
supposed to possess it likewise. Disease, he 
believed, was the result of an affection of 
this vital principle. Every disease was divis- 
ible into certain disease-elements, viewed 
as parts of the whole, and these were again 
divisible into secondary elements. He ex- 
plained putrid fevers as specific vital diseases 
— in which view, of course, he embodied 
humoral ideas. 

In Germany at about this time a similar 
doctrine obtained — a doctrine of vital forces 
which the versatile Reil (1759-1813) elabo- 
rated into a system. 

Meantime in England a doctrine was elab- 
orated by Erasmus Darwin (1731-1802), which 
partook in a certain degree of the doctrines 
of Stahl, Hoffmann, Haller, Brown, and 
Bordeu. Erasmus Darwin distinguished him- 
self not only as a physician, but as a poet, phi- 
losopher, and physiologist. He was a friend 
of James Watt. Of his life it is said that by 
his practice and very fortunate marriages he 
became wealthy, ate much, and drank noth- 
ing but water. His chief work, entitled

FOREIGN BODY IN BRAIN. 

At the last meeting of the Medical Society 
of the State of North Carolina, Doctor Charles 
G. O'Hagen, of Greenville, exhibited a piece 
of iron two and a half inches long, weighing 
about four hundred grains, from the breech 
of an old gun, with the following history: 

About five years ago a colored man with a 
desire of making more noise than any one 
else, filled a rifle full of powder and exploded 
it. After the resultant excitement subsided, 
a wound was found in the bridge of his nose, 
doing some injury to the frontal bones. The 
man remained in this unsatisfactory condition 
for about four years. In February, 1894, he 
was seen by Doctor O'Hagen, who probed 
for the cause of the wound and found a hard 
substance. With a pair of forceps this piece 
of iron was drawn out, after some vigorous 
pulling. During all the period the iron had 
been buried in the head of the negro he had 
been intellectually and physically as strong 
as before, indeed had experienced little or no 
inconvenience except some discharge at the 
point of injury. 

Doctor O'Hagen thinks the piece of iron 
must have remained between the hemispheres 
of the brain during these four years. After 
its removal the wound healed with little 
trouble. 

This calls to mind a somewhat parallel 
case which appears under the title of " Brain 
Wounds" in the Therapeutic Gazette of May, 
1889, page 329, wherein the breech-pin of an 
old "Tower musket" was removed from the 
brain of a young man twenty years of age. 
The explosion of the gun had driven this

portion thereof into the forehead, slightly to 
the left of the median line, and the rear point 
of the breech-pin had hooked behind the 
sella turcica. The screw which held the 
breech portion of the pin to the stock was 
jammed against the superior portion of the 
cranial vault. This solid mass of iron was 
nearly five ounces in weight, two and three- 
fourths inches long, five-eighths of an inch 
broad, and perhaps one- fourth of an inch 
thick along its posterior and flattened por- 
tion (the cylindrical portion was five- eighths 
of an inch in diameter and nine-sixteenths 
long). The testimony of the most conserva- 
tive witnesses was that not less than six or 
eight heaping teaspoonfuls of brain matter 
had been lost, and with the extraction of the 
breech-pin it was found necessary to remove 
nearly a teacupful of disintegrated brain sub- 
stance—in all six or eight ounces by measure 
must have been taken away. Though this 
wound penetrated the left lobe of the brain 
four and a half inches, actual measurement, 
the patient recovered, and, after a somewhat 
checkered career extending over twenty 
years, eventually died of delirium tremens. 
Several other unique cases of brain wound 
are cited in this article. 



GHOSTS. 



So distinguished an authority as Mr. John 
Fiske — whose philosophic and historical 
writings have raised the American standard 
of criticism to a level with that of England, 
if not indeed above it — ascribes the idea of 
ghosts to the indisputable fact of dreams. 
The uncritical savage cannot realize the 
generic distinction between the testimony of 
the awakened and united senses on the one 
hand, and the report which the soul brings 
back from its midnight " excursions " on the 
other; the persons who appear and speak to 
him in his sleep have not, he knows, been 
bodily present in his tent; either the sleeper's 
soul, or ghost, must have gone forth and met 
with the souls, or ghosts, of others, or the 
latter must have found entrance to the sleep- 
ing-apartment in spirit form and there held 
converse with the spirit of the sleeper. And 
inasmuch as the dreams do not confine them- 
selves to tete-a-tetes with the living, but call 
up the images of those who have crossed the 



Styx, the very natural conclusion is that the 
souls (or ghosts) of the latter have survived 
the ordeal of death and are able to reappear 
to the living, not only in sleep but whenever 
the "conditions" of waking life are auspi- 
cious. 

We cannot be absolutely certain that the 
savage's theory is incorpect. But we venture 
to think that it is safer to trust the impres- 
sions made upon the waking mind, and to 
employ these as a criterion of the validity of 
other impressions, than it is to elevate the 
vagaries of sleep to the dignity of evidence 
equal in rank to that of the alert senses. But 
because it is true that a certain degree of 
restf ulness — candor, receptivity — is necessary 
in order to receive the truth when one is 
awake, and because, too, of the unfortunate 
rarity of this mental attitude, sleep some- 
times affords occasion for corrective impres- 
sions; hence sleep itself is simulated in the 
reveries of poetry and worship, as a condition 
peculiarly suitable to the reception of those 
generalizations that escape the busy and dis- 
orderly brain of the man of the world. This 
repose of the waking mind is in every way 
superior to the repose of sleep; there is often 
more disorder and confusion in dreams than 
there is in the market-place, for the under 
strata of character go with us there, while 
the critical faculty is drugged. 

Dreams are mostly reminiscences. The 
multitudinous impressions stored away in the 
brain are ransacked at night; and so marvel- 
lous is the power of creative mind that these 
fragments of waking experience are arranged 
in a consistent panorama, different in its 
movement from anything that ever actually 
occurred in connection with the dramatis 
personce of the dream. The sub-consciousness 
of man is aware of some things which the 
clearer light of consciousness itself obscures,, 
just as the stars are obscured by the sun; but 
its chief function in sleep seems to be to 
masquerade in the cast-off clothes — the for- 
gotten impressions — of the waking mind. It 
must also be admitted that mere description 
is capable of making a picture for the mem- 
ory to subsequently resuscitate; even the 
musing of the poet, as Shakspeare has proved 
to us, may summon the dry bones and clothe 
them in the beauty of a Desdemona or the 
villainy of an Iago. The same faculty which

weavi icr the isolated suggestions of 

ration or narrative, and makes of them 

a man. is at work in sleep; its 

materials have been supplied; it is making 

: them. So far as we know, there is 
no objective reality in one case more than 
in the other; but the - being 

lard in sleep, the picture leaps into a 
vividness which in the absence &lt;&gt;f sl&lt; 
could not assume, »t perhaps in the 

Case of a few mystics like Swedenb&lt; • 
Boehme, or under the peculiar circumstances 
which usually accompany the seeing of 
" ghos 

The gfa always trust their eyes; 

but in sleep the eyes receive no external im- 
. yet the sleeper sets. Is it not rea- 
sonable to suppose that a certain aura — a 
hypnotic effect — caused perhaps by the weird 

ations of death and of ghastly crime — 
may pass over the senses and leave the sub- 
ject for the moment only mechanically awake, 
so that the germs of uncanny suggestion, 
from whatever source derived, burst into 
flower, and lo! he sees a ghost ? 

So hard-headed and practical a man as the 
late lamented Doctor Worthington, of Sher- 
brooke, Quebec, has given his testimony, as 
the readers of Tn i Midi- m Age are aware, 
to the apparent existence of ghosts. He did 
not undertake to explain the phenomenon, but 
his account proves that the local atmosphere 
was saturated with grim associations, in the 
midst of which the "ghosts" were in the 
habit of appearing. People of a cheerful and 
hearty disposition — and Doctor Worthington 
was one of them — do not see ghosts under 
cheerful and ordinary conditions. There is 
always a suggestion of "mental pathology," 
so to speak, about the appearances. Crime, 
and death, and religious exaltation, creating a 
certain mental alienation from common affairs 
and the work and play of life, are significantly 

ated with the apparitions from the 
tk fields of asphodel." 

If tiiese foreigners really have a visible 
personality, they are inexplicably fastidious 
in their selection of time and place for " com- 
ing out." If, on the other hand, we must 
look to the mental (and relatively to the 
nervous) condition of the ghost-seer for an ex- 
planation of the phenomenon, we find it in the 
temporary suspension of the critical faculty — 



ntrol 
of thi which protects us ordinarily 

from delusions and frauds. Such a SUA 

sion of t: □ is, perhaps, uot pr&lt; 

but who among us has fa. led to observe the 
fact that fascinating Btonlshing 

situations invariably withdraw the attention 
from its ordinary channels, and expose the 
observer to more or ious error in 

encc to events that are taking place 
before his eyes' This is one of the secrets 
of the success of prestidigitators and spiritist 
u materializes." In any unnatural attitude 
of the nervous system, as of the body, a par- 
tial paralysis or somnolence supervene 
some respects equivalent to the suspension 
of faculty which occurs during sleep; and the 
result may be (who knows ?) that visions and 
apparitions corresponding to the suggestions 
of the environment or to the prep 
of the individual leap into the foreground, as 
dreams do in sleep. A moment later, when 
the nerves have successfully struggled to 
arouse themselves, the vision disappears. 



CHANGE OF BASE. 

Under this caption the Times and Register 
gives utterance to the following: 

Well! antiseptics are as dead as Caesar's wife. 
This wonderfully seductive germ theory is being 
slowly but surely undermined by our latest inves- 
tigators. The ubiquitous microbes, like the poor, 
we are now told, are always with us and in us, am 
all quite harmless except for what is supposed 
be their toxic products or secretions. 

Antiseptics, so-called, have been proven to be 
quite inert on living tissues except when employed 
of such strength us to simultaneously devitalize 
living protoplasm, produce a superficial tissue- 
necrosis or severe irritation. They have gone; 
and here we have asepsis, another name for cleanli- 
ness. 

The latest offspring of scientific therapeut I 

antitoxin It may be as well, how 

before we give the stamp of approval to a remedy, 
to have a clear idea of the disease. There are cer- 
tainly good grounds for disputing the claim that 
Loeffler's germ is an essential ^etiological factor in 
diphtheria, as we understand it chemically, for in 
some of the most virulent and mortal cases it can- 
not he found, while on the contrary in many of the 
mildest forms of pharyngitis multitudes of the 

bacilli abound 

Experimental research has vastly aided in ex* 
plaining many obscure questions in the science of 
medicine; but to expect it to displace the necessity

of patient and exact clinical observations at the 
bedside, or to wholly eradicate empiricism in medi- 
cine, it is scarcely necessary to assert, is more 
than we hope to realize. 

It must be remembered, in spite of the 
brilliant claims which have surrounded the 
germ theory, that the so-called cholera ba- 
cillus could not be demonstrated in the water 
poisoning the inhabitants of Hamburg and 
Altona; neither could the so-called typhoid 
bacillus be discovered in the water supply 
which last year induced the epidemic in 
Worthing. 

The belief that infectious diseases are due 
to a poison and not a germ, gathers added 
weight when we reflect that no germ which 
could possibly stand in relation of cause has 
ever been demonstrated in that most infec- 
tious of all diseases, viz., variola; yet we do 
know that the contents of a vesicle or pustule 
inoculated into the most healthy of individuals 
will surely induce a typical though perhaps 
mild clinical picture of the malady. Then, 
too, the germ theory is indebted more to 
Pasteur than to any other one person — a 
man devoid of pathological information, who 
is in no sense a medical man, and the chief 
of whose exploitations is in the domain of 
hydrophobia, the rarest of all diseases (if 
indeed it is a disease per se) — one that pos- 
sesses no pathology, and upon post-mortem 
discloses no lesion except meningeal con- 
gestion, which is common also to a multi- 
tude of other maladies. Pasteur's anti-rabic 
|doctrine has been made the pedestal upon 
jwhich the germ theory rests, and yet no one 

las pretended to have discovered the microbe

EDITORIAL NOTES. 



lateria iledica and Common Sense.— 

Recently the Medical Record commented 
[most pertinently upon the fact that "we have 
f:oo many drugs, too many preparations of 
Irugs, and too much teaching of materia 
nedica." This is an evil which is con- 
tinually increasing, with the result that: 
| ( The druggist is year by year constantly 
)bliged to encumber himself more and more 
ijrith useless and expensive material; the 
tudent is obliged to load his already bur- 
dened memory with a mass of useless clinical 



or pharmaceutical facts; and, finally, the 
practitioner is thereby so embarrassed that 
he speedily forgets a large part of his materia 
medica and settles down to the use of routine 
remedies that are suggested by chance in- 
stead of being the result of ripe experience 
and good judgment." 

The remedy is in the hands of teachers 
and those who revise our pharmacopoeias. 
Matters have arrived at such a stage that it 
is now desirable that each drug be carefully 
considered and all unnecessary preparations 
thereof dropped. 

Caution.— 

Cases of glanders attributed to the use of 
impure equine serum are already noted. A 
recent writer states, moreover, that " although 
strenuously denied, it is now well ascertained 
that several of the horses from which anti- 
toxin was obtained by Aronson were suffer- 
ing from glanders." 

Whether the above assertions are true or 
false, it certainly would be well for the medi- 
cal profession at large to refresh themselves 
concerning the treatment of this usually fatal 
veterinary disease; also to scrutinize the 
product employed. 

A Handsome Fee. — 

According to the Indian Medical Record, 
an English army surgeon received a quarter 
of a million dollars for occasional attendance 
during three months on the Nawab of Ram- 
pur, during an ordinary attack of rheuma- 
tism. 

Young and ambitious American practi- 
tioners will find no occasion to emigrate to 
India, in spite of the foregoing; the land of 
the Hindu, Parsee, et al., is well supplied 
with medical men, both foreign and native. 

Why?— 

A puzzle for pathologists is the fact that 
during the visitations of cholera to Paris the 
epidemic has always been most fatal to per- 
sons living above the second story. 

Justice at Last !— 

The courts of New York State have de- 
cided that newspapers have no right to pub- 
lish the portrait of an individual without the 
full consent of the latter.

Another Pasteur Victim.— 

Two months ago a young officer named 
Stevenson, while serving with his regimen: 
in I ndia, was bitten by a dog which he stooped 
to stroke — the animal's teeth just penetrating 
the ^kin of one finger. The bite seemed to 
be trivial, but Mr. Stevenson hurried to Paris 
and placed himself under M. Pasteur's care, 
and about a fortnight ago returned home to 
Birkenhead, apparently none the worse and 
seemingly in robust health. Last Monday 
week Mr. Stevenson became ill, and a peculiar 
form of partial paralysis set in, the throat 
alone being affected, and he died on the fol- 
lowing Wednesday. — Medical Times (Lon-

A Hint to New Graduates. — 

New York affords better openings for the 
new members of the medical profession than 
does Texas. A gentleman who has traveled 
extensively in the latter State in quest of a 
location declares that not only is every ham- 
let and cross-roads supplied, but as a rule 
such are overstocked with medical men. 
" Many are standing about town awaiting 
emergency cases, with the expectation of 
realizing therefrom sufficient 'filthy lucre' to 
insure transportation to their native heaths." 

The same is practically true of Dakota, 
Nebraska, Kansas, and other Western States. 

Great Presence of Hind.— 

The disposition to seize every opportunity

Doctor F. P. Mann advises the wearing of 
a "thin pledget of cotton" in the nose to 
keep out the bacilli. Better close the ante- 
rior nasal fossae by sutures; but then how 
about the mouth? Must this orifice, too, be 
closed against the intrusion of bacilli? It 
looks very much like a case of "bacilli- 
phobia." By the way, "bacilliphobia" is no 
longer a rare disease. — Brief. 

Leprosy in Russia.— 

Over six hundred new cases of this disease 
are annually registered in the dominions of 
the Tzar. Indeed, such is the increase that it 
is now proposed to form a leper colony in 
the vicinity of Nicolavitch. The enclosure 
will comprise land for tillage, the necessary 
buildings for habitation, hospital, etc., the 
whole to be surrounded by a stockade. 

A Text for Thought.— 

We are not given to pessimism, but cer- 
tainly the tendency to overlook the quackish

practitioners who should use their active 
influence to combat this spirit of disorder.—

Gelatin Capsules. 

There are few conditions of the economy, 
either in health or disease, when gelatin cap- 
sules are not available as a means of elegant 
and palatable medication. Even when the

water or a draught of hot tea will insure their 
speedy disintegration. 

Diphtheria. — 

In general practice this malady is not in- 
curable or unmanageable; it is only in the 
laryngeal forms that it becomes especially 
dangerous. Consequently with modern meth-

The April number contains installments of 
the two serials: "A Singular Life," by Mrs. 
Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward, and "The 
Seats of the Mighty," by Gilbert Parker. 
Fiction is further represented by the second 
part of "Gridou's Pity," by Grace Howard 
Peirce. A touching single-number story by 
Annie Trumbull Slosson is entitled ' Dumb

utes the first of his papers, " A Talk Over 
Autographs." An atmosphere of spring is 
given to the issue by a delightful paper on 
" Flower Lore of New England Children," 
by Alice Morse Earle. Two papers of edu- 
cational interest are "The Expressive Power 
of English Sounds," by Professor Albert H. 
Tolman, and "The Basis of Our Educational 
System," by James Jay Greenough. Poems 
and the usual departments complete the 
number. 



Scribner's Magazine. Price, 25 cents; $3.00 a 
year. Charles Scribner's Sons, New York. 

The fiction of the April number is one of 
its strongest features. Installments of serials 
by the leading novelists of England and 
America, George Meredith and William D. 
Howells, are of themselves a literary feast. 
In addition there are two short stories: "A 
Question pf Art," by Robert W. Herrick, a 
young writer of unusual force and originality, 
and "La Belle Helene," by Miss Goodloe, 
the second of the very bright stories of Girls' 
College Life which she is contributing to this

STORIES. By Professor Z. Topelius. 
volumes; cloth: i2mo. Price, 75 cents each, 
1 per set. A. C. McClurg &amp;Co., Chicago. 

These are a series of stories giving vivid 
pictures of both Finnish and Swedish history, 
and in this respect rank with the works of 
Walter Scott and Louise Muhlbach. The 
first volume treats of the time of Gustavus 
Adolphus and the Thirty Years' War, the 
thrilling episodes of which commend it to all 
lovers of romance, while its historical truth- 
fulness and charming style make it attractive 
to literary readers of all classes. 

"Times of Battle and Resting" gives a 
stirring and graphic account of the conquest 
of Poland and Denmark by Charles X., and 
the more peaceful and important reign of 
Charles XL The title of the third volume, 
"The Times of Charles XII.," is sufficiently 
comprehensive. "The Times of Frederick 
I." merely supplements the preceding. 
"Times of Linnaeus" and Times of Alchemy" 
are natural sequences to the other works. 

These volumes, which, as before mentioned, 
are historically correct, deal with the history 
of two well known Finnish families — one a 
line of wealthy, autocratic peasants; the 
other a family of nobles who are really the 
illegitimate offshoot of the former. And all 
through these six volumes runs the interest- 
ing tradition of the "copper ring" which to- 
day is very widely believed throughout por- 
tions of Finland and Sweden. 

Finnish life and customs prior to the 
Russian conquest are delineated in detail. 
Sketches are given, moreover, of the Swedish 
court, and of the greatest of the Swedish and 
Finnish statesmen.

V ,. Y.Tk. 

This most interesting work deals with the 
little known region o( the Himalaya Pi; 
five hundred miles north of Calcutta, bor- 
dered by Hindustan, Cashmir, and Thibet, 
and known as Nepal, or Gurkhas' Land. This 
semi-independent province is ruled by its 
maharajah under the tutelage of an official 
Fnglish resident, and contains a mixed popu- 
lation of Gurkhas, Newars, Afagars, Gurungd 
Bhuteas, Limbus, Keratis, Lepchas, and I 
mir. Kabul and Persian Mohammedans. 

The narrative is especially interesting ben 
of the number of illustrations taken 
from photographs; otherwise the text would 
be comparatively mediocre, as it partakes 
rather of the scope of a magazine article than 
that of a bound volume of travel. We could 
wish Mr. Ballantine had elaborated more and 
entered further into the history of this pettj 
State, instead of devoting space to speculatioi 
upon sanitation and drainage and the politi- 
cal features of the region. We naturalb 
imagine that his opportunities were vei 
great — that, in fact, he saw so much that it 
was with difficulty he brought it into the 
compass desired, and felt it impossible to do 
the subject entire justice. Nevertheless the 
volume is a valuable contribution to the his- 
tory of a region that is little known or under- 
stood, and that does not even appear on the 
majority of maps. Precise information re- 
garding the fauna, archaeology, sport, etc., of I 
the Nepal Himalayas, yet remains to be given I 
to the world.

The Hahnemann Press, Philadelphia. 

This work, from a clinical standpoint, is of 
no little value. The author, though a homce- 
opathist, gives clinical data with a clearness 
and conciseness equaled by few medical 1 
writers. The opening volume deals in the 
most thorough and complete manner withi 
the specific infectious diseases and the neu-l 
roses, and is a credit alike to author and 
publisher. It is emphatically based on the 
work of physicians and not upon sectarianism, 
and for students, whether undergraduate 
post-graduate, is almost invaluable.

Therapeutic Brevities, 



Liquor Sedans. — This was originally gotten 
up for cases of pelvic disease, but its employ- 
ment in the dreadful combination of tubercle 
and uterine disease is indicated and will be 
of value. Cases of neurasthenia in men suf- 
fering much from pain caused by profuse 
protoplastic colloid discharges in urine are 
helped thereby. It is a good anodyne in 
cancerous cases. I also believe that much 
of the surgery done to-day for aching, suffer- 
ing women would be prevented if medical 
men would use this standard preparation. A 
Iwoman with pelvic abscess needs surgery 
through the abdominal walls or vagina or 
rectum; but because an ovary is sore and 
somewhat degenerated in structure, or the 
womb is enlarged, the knife should not be 
ilways employed. One case that particularly 
irrests my attention now is of a young woman 
vho had borne three children: extensive 
i aceration of the perineum; womb enlarged, 
sensitive to touch with finger, and especially 
io internal exploration; subject to spells of 
inconsciousness and rigidity of body; pain 
| ,n back, pelvis, and head; dysmenorrhea; 
[ ! ery sensitive to medicine of any nature; was 
; ble to take Liquor Sedans in small doses; 
■ ecame pregnant, and bore healthy child at 
all term, November, 1894, six years after 
I he birth of the previous one. A child was 
: esired in this family, as the oldest boy and 
j le only daughter had died in 1891 of diph- 
: leria. — Doctor John A. Cutter, in Medi- 
\\il Bulletin. 



: Stone Broth. — The old recipe for stone 
roth has gone out of fashion, but the prin- 
ple involved in it is at the root o'f many 
.iventions of modern times. We were told 
» boil a smooth pebble from the brook, adding 
little salt and pepper, an onion, divers vege- 
.bles as a relish, while the flavor was im- 
*oved by the addition of a mutton bone. 

doubt the broth was good, and equally no 
)ubt the modern suggestion that ladies and 
'.ntlemen suffering from insomnia should go 
lopping" in Kent is good also, notwith- 
anding the feeble hypnotic influence of the

ribor for nothing, and the farmer, in return

1 from which people suffer nowadays, " hop- 
jig" ought to be a cure. The fresh air, the 
\ig hours of not too laborious work, the 

liiple diet, the absence of responsibility, and 
Ms probably hard bed, give as complete a 



change as possible from the habits of mental 
worry and bodily indulgence so often at the 
root of the malady. We have the greatest 
possible respect for the therapeutic virtues of 
the hop, but when prescribed in this form we 
are reminded of the pebble in the stone broth, 
and attribute the excellence of the prescrip- 
tion to its other ingredients. — British Medical

Lactophenin.-~\ have tried this new rem- 
edy as an analgesic in over eight hundred 
cases. In over one hundred cases of pneu- 
monia I have had occasion to notice its 
effects, and the fact that it is a safe and 
speedy antipyretic. I cannot say too much 
of its soothing effects on the nervous system 
and of its general superiority above all other 
synthetic analgesics. 

Recently I had occasion to prescribe it for 
a case of occipital neuralgia after all other 
remedies had failed, and the relief that was 
afforded was both speedy and permanent. I 
sometimes find it advantageous to combine it 
with caffeine. 

One notable fact about Lactophenin is, 
that in no instance has it ever appeared to 
induce that blue, livid condition of the lips 
and face that so frequently succeeds upon the 
administration of acetanilid, antipyrin, phe- 
nacetin, etc. 

In inflammatory rheumatism and in la 
grippe, in conjunction with quinine and sali- 
cylate of soda it is my sheet-anchor; in the 
former malady it is advantageously alternated 
with syrup of trifolium compound. — Doctor 
J. C. Dwyer, Valentine, Nebraska. 



Phytolacca. — This drug is an antiseptic 
germicide especially available in diphtheritic 
or scarlatinal sore throat when applied locally 
with swab or brush; it is also equally effica- 
cious in the former malady administered in- 
ternally. In all forms of tonsillitis and sore 
mouth it is an excellent remedy; likewise 
valuable as a dressing to indolent ulcers and 
foul- smelling sores. It is also very effica- 
cious in chronic rheumatism. It is the remedy 
in parotitis, and likewise in metastatic orchi- 
tis. I apply externally on wounds caused 
by rusty nails or bites inflicted by snakes or 
dogs, and have found it universally success- 
ful. It is most efficacious for sore breasts 
and sore nipples, applied dry or in the form 
of an ointment. In fact it is the ideal germ- 
destroyer, and once employed its use will 
never be given up. It has been lauded as 
an anti-fat, but so far as this is concerned it 
is probably as valuable as any anti-fat rem- 
edy. Wherever there is pallid mucous mem-

Epistaxis. — Doctor Baumgarten recom- 
mends thorough examination of the inside 
of the nose in order to discover the source of 
bleeding, which will usually be found at the 
anterior part of the septum in the form of 
one or more small superficial vessels of red 
color, or else little nodules, erosions, varicose 
veins, or a small empty vessel looking black- 
ish on a red background. Occasionally the 
point of haemorrhage is covered with red 
blood crusts which must be softened and 
carefully raised in order to expose the seat 
of morbidity. If there is nothing of a sus- 
picious nature to be seen, the patient must 
be made to blow his nose several times. 

Another method is to apply a tampon of 
wet cotton to the septum and press it more 
and more firmly until the morbid spot bleeds. 
Doctor Baumgarten uses the galvanic cautery 
or chromic acid, and sometimes both. The 
latter is preferable, and one of the most 
excellent of haemostatics. — Kansas Medical 
Journal. 



Urethral Contusions and Lacerations. — 
Doctor Reineking says: Make careful at- 
tempts to introduce a soft catheter, and, if 
successful, leave it in place for five or six 
days, irrigating the bladder daily with boric- 
acid solution; after that time the reintroduc-

bhorbia Pilulifera. — This agent is used 
principally in the. form of a decoction, which 
can be made from one ounce of the fluid 
extract to fifteen ounces of hot water; never- 
theless the tincture and fluid extract ami the 
aqueous extract are also in common use. A 
wineglass of the infusion, or one-fourth to 
one drachm of the tincture, or fifteen to forty 
drops of the fluid extract, is the dose. 

The cases in which it has produced marked 
and satisfactory results are those of asthma 
of any variety, uncomplicated; asthma as thel 
result of bronchitis; bronchitis with sharp, 
hacking, irritable cough; dyspnoea from 
emphysema or from failure of the heart cen

It has also been used with excellent results 
in spasmodic cramp. It is a comparatively 
safe remedy in medicinal doses, no case oi

Ustilago Maydis during Labor. — Excellent 
results are obtained by administration of the 
fluid extract Ustilago maydis in cases of primi 
tive inertia of the uterus. The contractions! 
appear twenty -five to thirty minutes, forty at 
the most, after the drug has been ingested, 
and are physiological, there being no con- 
vulsive or tetanic character about them. 
There is no contraction of the cervix, and 
the drug can be given without danger at no 
matter what time during labor, acting ever 
better when dilatation is already obtain 
at the time of inertia. Delivery and the ex 
pulsion of the placenta are in no way delayec 
or prevented. No bad results accrue either 
to mother or child. This drug has been em 
ployed in Germany and America for twenty 
years, and in obstetrical practice is far supe 
rior to ergot.— Doctor V. S. Gromsdeff, i"

Apomorphine. — This medicament cannot be 
too highly esteemed. It induces emesis 
promptly, and thereby affords ready relief in 
croup and capillary bronchitis, whereby it is 
a great boon to children; moreover, it may 
be readily employed hypodermatically in 
subjects who refuse relief or who are under 
the influence of poison with suicidal intent. 
In bronchitis, trachitis and catarrhal pneu- 
monia it is one of our best expectorants when 
employed in doses of one-sixtieth to one- 

, twentieth of a grain. From the fact that it 
induces emesis by its action through the 

J central nervous system, and not by irritation 
of the mucous membrane, it is the preferable 
remedy in inflammatory conditions of the 
stomach in which emetics are indicated. — 
Doctor W. A. Carmichael, in La?icet-Cli?iic. 



Chloral Hydrate in Labor. — Chloral hydrate 
assists dilatation of the os. No post-partum 
haemorrhage follows, nor is there any delay 
or difficulty in the expulsion of the placenta. 
Chloral, I think, might take the place of 
chloroform, if given in small repeated doses 
during the long and tedious labor of primi- 
parae. It does not seem to diminish the ex- 
pulsive power, and might be further tried; it 
does relieve rigid perineum, thereby avoiding 
:he use of forceps. For many years I have, 
rom time to time, observed its benefit to 
:he poor, worn-out, and anxious mother, 
lespondent with fear. After a dose of the 
Chloral the frenzy passes off, and the patient 
;ettles down to her travail, which has a 
lappy and speedy result. — Doctor Gardi- 
ner, in Lancet (London). 



A Hint in Prescribing. — Now that the price 
f empty capsules has become so greatly re- 
uced that they are within the reach of all, 
ven the country practitioner, they should, 
semingly, form as much a part of the arma- 
lentarium therapeuticu'm of the physician as 
le pocket-case or hypodermic syringe. Why 
ause patients to "swallow a bitter pill" in 
le form of a compressed tablet or tablet 
•iturate, when the taste of such may be 
ffectually masked by enclosing in the popu- 
r gelatin capsule ? The disguising of the 
iste, moreover, entails no sacrifice of speedy 
ficacy, as the gelatin dissolves quickly and 
eposes its contents to the action of the 
omach. — Therapeutic Notes. 

! Benzoin in Surgery. — Doctor Garland Sher- 

• HI highly recommends compound tincture 

enzoin in cases of injuries about the hands. 



especially those inflicted by machinery. After 
careful cleaning, disinfection, and complete 
arrest of haemorrhage, a layer of absorbent 
cotton is placed around the wound, over 
which the tincture is poured until the cotton 
is saturated. This forms an air-tight aseptic 
coating after evaporation of the alcohol, and 
is very advantageous in practice, because it 
need not be frequently changed — sometimes 
it can be left on for a week without incon- 
venience. If it becomes loose, a little more 
Benzoin tincture may be added. — American 
Medical Compend. 



Prostatic Hypertrophy. — It seems to me that 
subcutaneous torsion of the spermatic cord, 
so as to cut off the blood supply of the testis, 
causing its subsequent atrophy, would be as 
effectual in man as it is in animals, and thus 
secure prostatic atrophy with as much cer- 
tainty as by castration This procedure 
would be much more readily accepted by the 
patient, in that it is merely a manipulative 
operation, free from the "cutting" and dep- 
rivation of organs which is so naturally re- 
pugnant to his mind. — Doctor C. E. Rich- 
mond, in Lancet (London).

Infusion of senega, 8 ounces.

Beta-naphthol, 30 parts. 
Styrax ointment, 30 parts. 

To be applied with strong friction every night 
for a week, then interrupted for six days, when it 
may be repeated if necessary.

Valerianate of Amyl. — A writer in the Med- 
ical Record says that in two-and-a-half-grain 
capsules every half-hour, up to five or six 
doses, this agent will relieve the pain of 
nephritic colic or of cystitis, though it has. 
no influence on the calculus.

.: action t, causing contraction 

of the non-striated muscular fibre, is so con- 
stant that we may well say this is its chief 
and general characteristic. This action lias 

noted by all observers, and is so intense 
that in ca n produced by eating 

; contaminated with it, for a consider- 
able time the circulation in the smaller 
blood-vessels, arterioles and capillaries is im- 
peded to such an extent that gangrenous 
spots appear, and in 'he death 

of an entire extremity has been known to 
ensue. 

S action has been a hint for the US 
Ergot in aneurysm -with benefit in some in- 
stances; but 1 have yet to &gt;ee in print or to 
hear in any medical mteting a recommenda- 
tion of the same drug in cases of varicose 
veins. I do not pretend to say this is a new 

• the remedy, but it is new to me, and 
certainly is not as popular as I believe it de- 
serves to be. 

cral years ago it was suggested to me 
for a lady suffering from varicose veins. The 
improvement was slow but steady, she having 
no lapses, and in a few months being prac- 
tically well. Since that time Ergot has been 
my chief remedy, giving relief invariably, 
and in a number of cases producing practi- 
cally a cure. 

diort history of the treatment of the 
worst case I ever saw, with the most gratify- 
ing results, is my apology for this article: 

. K , aged 38, mother of six chil- 
dren, sent for me one night to arrest haemor- 
rhage from a ruptured varicose vein. When 
I arrived I found syncope had relieved the 
flow and my patient was nearly exsanguinated. 
She occupied the bloodiest bed in the bloodi- 
est room I ever saw. I fitted a compress over 
the oozing wound, applied a bandage, and or- 
dered normal liquid Ergot, three drops every 
hour during the remainder of the night. In 
the morning I found more improvement than 
I had dared to expect. But such a pair of 
legs! -a complete network of varicose veins 
from the knees down, from the size of a 
chicken's quill up to the size of my finger. 
Not a spot large enough to put the end of 
my finger, witnout touching a distended 
blood vessel. Not so bad above the knees, 
but some very bad ones. The veins were 
purple and blue, with a good many black 
spots, where, she said, she had bled before. 
She was pregnant, and only just past the 
fifth month. Not a very cheerful outlook, to 
say the very least. 



1 "rde" iu bed, the legs 

bandaged, and left an ounce of normal liquid 

She remained in bed two days, and 

then got up and went to work as hard as - ver 
— for she was a hard working woman, even to 
helping her husband in the field. Never had 
her legs bandaged but the tunc 1 did it.

Sent for to attend her in confinement, 

but when I arrived the babe had been born 

and was being ghed ten 

pound-. Mrs. E remarked: ' D 

this is the largest of any of my babies, and I 
had the easiest time. We were not expect- 
ing it yet for two weeks, and I have been 
helping George in the potato patch all 
day." 

I examined her legs and found the vai 
condition nearly gone. She said she had 
taken her medicine four times a day up to con- 
finement. These people, being hard put to 
keep the wolf from their door, and being the 
honest kind whose greatest concern is t 
every cent they owe, have learned well to 
make as few debts as possible; consequently,! 
I made but three visits at the time the ha-m-l 
orrhage tcok place, and did not see her again! 
until she was confined. I must say I do not! 
remember of ever having seen any remedy! 
accomplish more, in the face of such adverse! 
conditions. 

I am aware this paper is open to criticism,! 
inasmuch as it does not touch upon the many! 
and varied causes of this malady, but all thatl 
can be found elsewhere. If the coatings of j 
the blood vessels were strong enough to re 
sist the blood pressure, from whatever cause, 
there would be no varix; and to what extent 
the dilatation is compensatory, and 1 
quentiy the lesser evil, I do not know. Or 
it possible we have here a drug deeper-rea 
ing in its action, abrogating the cause 
well as causing tonit: contraction, thereby 
giving nature a chance to heal and strength 
the weakened parts ? Hut as the sole duty of 
the physician is to cure his patient in the 
shortest, safest, and most perma; ent manner 
should we not be satisfied, especially in thi 
case, where no bad effects whatever were ob- 
served ? 

Possibly the remedy promoted an eas\ 
earlier delivery, as the bones of the child's 
head were rather soft though not unusuajly 
so, and the event anticipated the exp 
tune two weeks. But as the youngster h 
been in perfect health, no harm was done 
him, even though he can celebrate his birth 
dav two weeks sooner.

Had the remedy brought on an abortion 
fatal to the child, was not the emergency of 
the case a sufficient warrant even for that, 
since her condition was such that unless an 
early and favorable change was brought 
about, these repeated haemorrhages might 
have proved calamitous ? — Doctor J. Fer- 
ris, before the Cincinnati Medical Society. 



Skin Diseases. — Familiar appellations for 

skin diseases are not confined to the laity. 

The most diverse, ridiculous, and unmeaning 

terms have been applied to these affections, 

such as "tetter," that usually refers to 

! eczema, or may mean psoriasis or lupus. 

; "Baker's itch," "grocers' itch," "milk crust," 

"tooth rash," are also used to designate some 

\ form of eczema. 

"Liver spots" may refer to chloasma, a 
J pigmentary affection, or to tinea versicolor, 
[a. vegetable parasitic disease. 

"The itch," to scabies, a disease caused by 

jthe Acarus scabici. The expression "army 

litch" would lead one to suppose that it was 

distinct from scabies, yet we recognize it as 

||the same disease. 

" Blood boil " has no scientific meaning and 
its applied to various diseases. 

" Hives " is recognized by some as urticaria, 
jlby others as varicella (chicken-pox). 

"Shingles" means herpes zoster, an acute 
lidisease, characterized by an eruption of 
groups of vesicles upon an iaflamed base 
ilong the course of certain nerves. 
i "Prickly heat" usually refers to a disease 
unown as miliaria, an affection of the sweat 
glands. 

I "Dandruff," to the dry form of seborrhcea 
Ij)f the scalp. 

I "Black- heads" (flesh-worms), to comedo, a 

:ollection of sebaceous matter in the dis- 

ended sebaceous glands. The little black- 

. leads are caused by the accumulation of dust 

• ;nd pigment. 

" Ringworm " is a vegetable parasitic dis- 

ase, caused by the trichophyton fungus, and 

m known as trichophytosis. 

I "Barbers' itch" is caused by this same 

angus upon the bearded portion of the face, 

nd is designated by the term tinea sycosis. 

: "Fish skin" disease is a congenital affec- 

on characterized by dryness and scaling of 

le skin. Its proper name is ichthyosis. 

. ' "Chap " is usually a mild form of eczema, 

tended with cracking of the skin. — Health. 



Almost every patient has fever, headache, 
pains in the back: 

When the membrane is torn away, reinfec- 
tion takes place and the membrane re-forms: 

If the disease is treated locally alone, the 
patient dies from blood-poisoning. — The 
local treatment is worthless unless some gen- 
eral remedies are used. If the local lesions 
are treated exclusively, and the general sys- 
tem left untreated, the complications often 
seem to develop more promptly: 

When both local and systemic remedies are 
used, the percentage of recoveries is larger: 

The complications, as seen in many cases, 
fully demonstrate that it is systemic and local 
in character: 

The fact that it can be transferred to 
healthy persons by means of water, milk, 
cups, and spoons, shows it to be infectious in 
nature: 

If a portion of the membrane is placed 
upon the hand or arm, it takes on the form 
of diphtheria: 

Scarlatina and albuminuria are frequent 
and final results: 

Stimulants are indicated where the heart's 
action grows weak and infrequent: 

Disinfection of bed-clothing, cups, plates, 
spoons and rugs used in the sick-room, is an 
excellent precautionary measure: 

The sick-room could be better handled if 
furniture and curtains were removed. — 
Doctor Luigi Doane, in Medical Brief. 



Diphtheria. — This disease must be a 
ineral systemic complaint with local mani- 
stations, for the following reasons: 



Compensatory Action of Cerebral 
Hemispheres. — Assuming that sleep is most 
profound during the first two or three hours, 
and that the left cerebral hemisphere, being 
normally the seat of the speech and right- 
hand centres, is more active in the waking 
state, and therefore more exhausted and less 
accessible to stimuli than the right during 
sleep, it was found that on lightly tickling 
either side of the face of ordinary persons in 
this stage of somnolence, the sleeper made 
repellent movements invariably with the left 
hand, even when lying on the left side and 
it was necessary to withdraw the arm from 
beneath the body. In eight left-handed per- 
sons the right arm alone was moved. These 
experiments are demonstrative of the com- 
pensatory or vicarious action of the one 
cerebral hemisphere during deep sleep. As 
further illustrations of the point, in dogs ex- 
hausted by complete deprivation of sleep, 
reflex movements only occurred on one or 
the other side, alternating periodically as if 
one-half of the brain were temporarily asieep. 
In cases of left hemicrania with disturbance 
of speech and writing, the latter act could be

well to know that the appearance of sugar in 

rinc of puerperal women is d&lt; 
to be dence of any morbid 

condition calling for urgent measures. Sugar, 
in greater or lesser amount, is present, ac- 
cording to Doctor Lewers, in the urine of 

puerperal women, but even when com- 
paratively abundant its presence is not neces- 
sarily associated with the classic collateral 
symptoms of glycosuria. The amount, in- 
deed, stands in some sort of relationship to 
the lacteal secretion, or rather excretion; 
when the flow is free, whether copious or 
otherwise, the amount of sugar discoverable 
in the urine is small; if, however, the output 
of milk is checked in any way, mechanically 
or otherwise, a certain proportion of the lac- 

- eliminated by the kidneys, giving rise 
to passing glycosuria. Belladonna, probably 
by reason of its effect in diminishing the ex- 
cretion of milk, increases the percentage of 
urinary sugar. It is to be supposed that the 
glycosuria disappears when lactation comes 
to an end, but as a matter of fact it has sel- 
dom been possible to continue the observa- 
tions a sufficient length of time to ascertain 
this point by direct examination. — Medical 
Record. 



Rksults of Extirpation of Poison 
Glands in Snakes. — Experiments were un- 
dertaken by Phisalix and Bertrand to deter- 
mine whether the toxicity of the blood of 
poisonous reptiles is due to an inner secre- 
tion of the poison glands, the toxicity of the 
blood being then dependent on absorption 
from the poison glands; or whether the glands 
act simply as a filter, extracting the poison 
from the blood. If the first were true, the 
toxicity of the. blood would be much dimin- 
ished by extirpation of the glands; if the 
second were true, the toxicity would be much 
increased. A large number of poisonous 
snakes suffered the operation of extirpation 
of the poison glands, the results proving be- 
yond question that the first hypothesis is 
correct — that the toxicity of the blood is de- 
pendent on absorption from the secretion of 
the poison glands. After operation the tox- 
icity of the blood was found steadily to 
decline for about fifty days; then it began 
gradually to increase, becoming about normal 
again in two and one-half months. This is 
held by the authors as indicating a slow

EXPERT TESTiriONY.* 

BY SAMUEL W. BURROUGHS.f 

We are taught that an expert is one who is 
versed in any science, art, or trade, and in 
law is one who by learning, observation and 
practice has become experienced in the art of 
his profession. 

He has also been defined as a skillful and 
experienced person; one having knowledge 
ind experience on certain subject matters of 
:ertain professional avocations. 

He is therefore accepted by law as a 
cientific witness for the purpose of giving 
:xpert testimony in support of the prosecution, 
»r on behalf of the defense, depending upon 
he truth of the matter and upon which side 
lie is called. 

A party having made the application for 
le introduction of expert testimony, and the 
&lt; ourt having ruled that the matter of inquiry 
rid investigation is one upon which the 
1 pinion of an expert may be received, and 
lat the witness introduced possesses the 
• scessary skill in the subject matter of in- 
airy, the examination of the expert witness 
\ next in order. 
It is highly important, however, that such 
:amination should proceed strictly in ac- 
•rdance with well settled rules governing 
lie introduction, admissibility or rejection of

of all such witnesses it is exceedingly essen- 
tial that questions should be so framed by 
counsel as not to call on the expert for a re- 
view of the testimony given by other wit- 
nesses in the case. 

The expert should not be allowed to draw 
conclusions of fact from the testimony of 
other witnesses in the case. To allow such 
conclusions would be to pass upon the credi- 
bility of the other witnesses, and therefore 
cover the very questions to be submitted to 
the jury. 

As expressed in the opinion of a celebrated 
case: 

A question should not be so framed as to 
permit the expert witness to roam through 
the evidence for himself, and gather the facts 
as he may consider them to be proved, and 
then state his conclusions concerning them.* 
— The object of all questions to experts 
should be to obtain their opinion as to the 
matter of skill or science which is in contro- 
versy, and at the same time to exclude their 
opinions as to the effect of the evidence in 
establishing controverted facts. 

Whenever a question is so framed by the 
examiner to an expert, the answer to which 
would necessarily draw a conclusion of fact, 
it should be excluded; for it is not the duty 
of an expert to reconcile a conflict of testi- 
mony. 

It is for the jury to pass upon the credi- 
bility of all the witnesses in the case at bar, 
and to find the facts, and to govern their ver- 
dict accordingly, having heard all the testi- 
mony, and having received from the court 
proper hypothetical instructions in law ap- 
plicable to and bearing thereupon— whether 
by request or in general. 

In the case of State vs. Feller, 25 Iowa, 67, 
74, the following question by the examining 
counsel was propounded to an expert witness;

: circumstance v pre-

that the defendant iras lane or insane when he 
committed the 

question, upon objection, was held to 
be improper, and answer theret laded 

for t! that it would have placed the 

expert in the place of the jury, whose prov- 
ince it was to have decided this very question. 
The question should have been framed 
ething like this: 

mining the testimony of the previous wit- 
- tending to show the circumstances, if any, 
leading up to the art, and tending to show the acts 
of defendant, if any, in relation to the homicide, to 
be true, and tending to show that the conduct of 
defendant, if in immediate connection with the act, 
•ras that, or was not that, of a sane man, as the 
case may have been, — state whether, in your opin- 
ion, at the time he committed the act defendant 
was sane or in- 

It is easily to be seen that the difference in 
form between the two questions is very dis- 
tinguishable in this, that an opinion of the 
expert witness by way of answer predicated 
upon the latter question, if either way, would 
have been left with the jury for what it was 
admissibly worth, leaving at the same time 
the veracity of the previous witnesses, upon 
whose testimony the opinion was based, with 
the jury — exclusively. 

Experts are not allowed to draw inferences 
or conclusions of fact from the evidence. 
Their opinions should be asked upon a hypo- 
thetical statement of facts. 

The Supreme Court of Massachusetts in 
the case of Dickinson vs. Fitchburg, 13th 
Gray, Mr. Chief Justice Shaw delivering the 
opinion, stated: 

In order to obtain the opinion of a witness 
on matters not depending on general knowl- 
edge, but on facts not testified of by himself, 
one of two modes is pursued: either the wit- 
5 present and hears all the testimony, 
or the testimony is summed up in the ques- 
tion put to him. And in either case the 
question is put to him hypothetically — 
whether, if certain facts testified of are true, 
he can form an opinion, and what that opin- 
ion is? 

In framing the hypothetical question, coun- 
sel may base it upon the hypothesis of the 



truth of all the evidence, or on a hypothesis 
framed on certain facts assumed to be proved 

for the purpose of the inquiry, 

If framed on the assumption of certain 
B, counsel m. u ts in ac 

cordance with his theory of them, it not 
'being essential that he should state the 
as they actually exist, but as they appear in 
evidence, leaving it to the jury to determine 
whether such be the facts from the evidence 
in the ca- 
lf it were the law that a hypothetical ques- 
tion could not be put for an answer to an 
expert unless the question states the facts as 
they exist under all circumstances, it would 
under such a rule be manifest that in a trial 
where there is a dispute as to the facts, there 
would be no room for a hypothetical question. 
The very meaning of hypothesis is that there 
must be a supposition or assumption of some- 
thing for the time being. 

In every issue each side has its theory of 
what the state of facts is, and therefore as 
sumes that it can be proven to the satisfac 
tion of the jury, and, thus assuming, shape 
hypothetical questions to expert witnesse 
accordingly for the basis of their opinion. 
Counsel may make an error in their 
sumption of facts in this regard; but this 
itself would not render the question whollj 
objectionable if it came within the possibl 
or probable range of the evidence upon whit 
it was predicated. In other words, the testi- 
mony should tend so near as possible 
establish every supposed fact embraced ii 
the question put to the expert witness. II 
the hypothetical question is clearly exagger- 
ated and unwarranted by any evidence ii 
the case upon which to base it, an objectit 
to it should be sustained; for, as declared b) 
our own Supreme Court in Frazer vs. Jennison 
42 Mich., 206: 

Counsel should not be permitted to em- 
brace in a hypothetical question anything 
not proved or offered to be proved. 



If, therefore, it should turn out that tht 
question includes circumstances which art 
neither proved, nor as to which there 1- 
tendency of proof, then the court should in 
struct the jury to disregard the opinion basec 
upon it. Hut if, on the other hand, then 
is any evidence tending to prove the fact.' 



THE MEDICAL AGE.

assumed, the jury should be allowed to weigh 
the evidence, and determine whether the 
supposed facts so stated correspond with the 
facts as proved. 

If there is no dispute as to the facts upon 
which the expert witness is to found his 
opinion, then the question should be so 
framed as to embrace all the facts, so that 
the witness may take them all into considera- 
tion. 

Various forms of inquiry have been adopt- 
ed, according to the circumstances of various 
cases. The inquiry, whether it states facts, 
or puts facts hypothetically, or refers to the 
testimony of witnesses as being true, should 
be so framed as to give the witness no 
occasion to decide upon the evidence, or 
mingle his own opinion of the facts as 
shown by the evidence with the facts upon 
which he is called to express a professional 
opinion. 

Hypothetical questions are sometimes by 
mistake put by lawyers — and good ones, too 
— so as to require the witness to decide upon 
the evidence, to find conclusions from the 
evidence, to reconcile conflicting facts and to 
determine which side preponderates. Such 
questions clearly seek the opinion of the ex- 
pert witness on the merits of the case, and 
are therefore very improper though perhaps 
hypothetical in construction. 

In some cases all the facts bearing on the 
issue might be summed up in a single ques- 
tion. 

When facts on one side conflict with facts 
on the other, the two sets are not to be in- 
corporated into one question, but their oppos- 
ing tendencies should be called to the atten- 
tion of the witness; and if his knowledge can 
furnish the explanation, from an expert stand- 
point, which harmonizes them, he should be 
it liberty to so state it as to enable the jury 
.0 know all the facts on which the opinion is 
Dased. 

There are exceptions to these rules. Where 
i medical expert had read the deposition of 
)laintiff, detailing minutely the injuries and 
&gt;odily condition resulting from an injury 
yhich he related, it was held proper to ask: 

From the knowledge gained by reading the de- 
osition, what is your opinion as to plaintiff's con- 
ition, and as to the cause of that condition, at the 
me the deposition was made? 



Where an expert has heard or read the 
evidence, there is no reason, it seems to me, 
why he might not form as correct a judg- 
ment based upon such evidence — assuming, 
of course, it to be true — as if the same evi- 
dence had been submitted to him in the form 
of a hypothetical question. 

The opinion of an expert should not be 
predicated on anything less than the entire 
testimony, if possible, whether actually or 
hypothetically presented. 

The advantage of the usual hypothetical 
question, including the substance of the whole 
testimony, is so great that it should not be 
sacrificed when the circumstances of the case 
plainly call for it. In other words, so that 
the jury may know with certainty upon what 
state of facts the expert bases his opinion, 
the hypothesis should be clearly and precisely 
stated under all circumstances. 

As an illustration I quote the hypothet- 
ical question propounded by the defense in 
the case of the Government against Guiteau: 

Q. — Assuming it to be a fact that there was a 
strong hereditary taint of insanity in the blood of 
the prisoner at the bar; also that at about the age 
of thirty-five years his own mind was so much de- 
ranged that he was a fit subject to be sent to an 
insane asylum; also that at different times after 
that date, during the next succeeding five years, he 
manifested such decided symptoms of insanity, 
without simulation, that many different persons, 
conversing with him and observing his conduct, 
believed him to be insane; also that in or about the 
month of June, 1881, at or about the expiration of 
said term of five years, he became demented by the 
idea that he was inspired of God to remove by 
death the President of the United States; also that 
he acted on what he believed to be such inspiration, 
and as he believed to be in accordance with the 
divine will in the preparation for, and in the ac- 
complishment of, such a purpose; also that he com- 
mitted the act of shooting the President under 
what he believed to be a divine command which he 
was not at liberty to disobey, and which belief 
made out a conviction which controlled his con- 
science and overpowered his will as to that act, so 
that he could not resist the mental pressure upon 
him; also that immediately after the shooting he 
appeared calm and as if relieved by the perform- 
ance of a great duty; also that there was no other 
adequate motive for the act than the conviction that 
he was executing the divine will for the good of his 
country, — assuming all of these propositions to be 
true, state whether, in your opinion, the prisoner 
was sane or insane at the time of shooting Presi- 
dent Garfield? 






Til E MEDICAL AGE, 



This hypothetical question having been put 
pelts, their answer was invari- 
ably. " Insane."' Ami, tl iel having 
propounded this question, expecting the an- 
• f insan I on the facts assumed 
to have been proved in accordance with their 

theory of the msel for the Govern- 

ment propounded a still longer hypothetical 
question to the same witnesses upon cross- 
examination, basing the same in form alike 
on the farts as appeared in evidence by other 
witnesses tending to show in connection with 
the prisoner mental activity, guarded deliber- 
ation, and premeditation, and thereby drew 
from these same expert witnesses an expres- 
sion of opinion which tended to show that, 
at the time of the shooting, the prisoner was 
sane. 

So it will be observed that the opinions of 
these experts as to Guiteau's sanity or in- 
sanity could have only aided the jury in the 
rendition of a just verdict after the jury had 
found which of the two opposing hypotheses 
under the testimony of the former witnesses 
was correct in fact. And in this, it seems, 
the jury experienced little or no trouble, for 
in finding respondent guilty they found that 
at the time of the shooting he was sane, and 
therefore doomed him to pay the penalty of 
life for life. 

The jury acted in this case upon well set- 
tled principles of law, as follows: 

The testimony of experts is to be consid- 
ered like any other testimony, and is to be 
tried by the same tests, and receive just so 
much weight and credit as the jury may 
deem it entitled to, when viewed in connec- 
tion with all the circumstances.* 

Expert testimony is given for the purpose 
of enlightening the jury, and not for the pur- 
pose of controlling their judgment. Its influ- 
ence must be legitimate, and must be of such 
a character as to outweigh, by its intrinsic 
force and probability, all conflicting testi- 
mony. 

It has been held: 

The jury cannot be required by the court 
to accept, as a matter of law, the conclusions 
of the witnesses instead of their own.f 



Upon the jury rests the - hiiity o! 

rendering a COIT© I verdii It, and if the testi- 
mony of the experts is opposed to the jury's 
Convictions Of truth, it is their duty to disre- 
gard it.* 

It is also improper to BO interrogate a med- 
ical expert as to elicit an opinion as to the 
law of tl for instance, to ask him 

whether a certain person possesses mental 
Capacity sufficient to enable him to make a 
will. He should only be required to state the 
degree of mental capacity or imbecility of 
the person, as the case may be, by the use of 
such terms as will best convey his ideas of the 
matter. If he had personal knowledge of 
the person making the will, as his patient at 
the time, from examination, treatment, and 
observation, and was familiar with his per- 
sonal characteristics, he might with legal 
propriety be asked whether the testator's 
mind and memory were sufficiently sound to 
enable him to know and understand the busi- 
ness in which he was engaged at the time he 
executed the will. And an answer from the 
expert would be pertinent. 

While the opinion of experts may be based 
on their observation and experience in similar 
cases, yet the principle is well settled that 
such witnesses cannot, on their direct examina- 
tion, be questioned concerning the particular 
cases which have happened to come within 
their observation, and which have no connec- 
tion with the case in hand.-f 

It is not necessary to assume a state of 
facts in those cases in which the expert is 
personally acquainted with the material facts 
in the case. If a physician visits a person 
and from actual examination and observation 
becomes acquainted with his mental condi- 
tion, he may state to the jury his opinion as 
to the sanity or insanity of the person at the 
time when he made such examination and 
observation. 

A fid so experts having personal knowledge 
of the facts, and their competency in this re- 
gard having been first established, have been 
permitted to testify:

ft Delivered in the Medical Department of the 
University of Buffalo, session of 1894-5/ 



1754, was early a victim of romantic yearn- 
ings, and his graduating thesis (delivered 
in Vienna) dealt with the influence of the 
planets upon man, and the use of the mag- 
net. After traveling extensively he erected 
a private institution, where he treated blind 
girls, fidgety old maids, and simpletons, until 
his deceptive methods were unmasked by a 
commission appointed by the Empress Maria 
Theresa, and he was compelled to leave 
Vienna in twenty-four hours. This martyr- 
dom recommended him in Paris, where the 
so-called Mesmerism speedily became fash- 
ionable. He finally undertook instruction in 
magnetizing, at the rate of 100 louis a head, 
and founded the "Order of Harmony." -His 
so-called baquets were tubs with magnetic 
ducts, partially filled with soft water and all 
kinds of ingredients, and armed with iron 
conductors, with which his pupils, joining 
hands, placed themselves in contact. At 
these seances Mesmer appeared in lilac- 
colored clothes, and professed to reinforce 
the action of the tubs by looks, gestures, 
playing upon the harmonica, and touching 
the subjects with wand or fingers. " If any 
one, particularly a lady, had a crisis at this 
time, she was borne to the 'crisis-chamber' 
by Mesmer himself, where he treated her 
alone; as only when alone, he claimed, could 
he attain success." He speedily became 
wealthy; managed to deceive even the Queen 
of France; and when he threatened to de- 
prive the country of his presence, 20,000 
francs were offered him to instruct others in 
his art; this offer, however, the wily charla- 
tan declined. In 1785 some fool penned an 
article extolling him as a worker of miracles; 
this stimulated the authorities to organize a 
committee of investigation, the adverse de- 
cision of which, along with some contributory 
evidence, made Paris too warm for him. 
After the Revolution he returned, but his 
day had passed, and he figures no more in 
medical history. He has had many imita- 
tors, and the mesmeric craze at times has 
infested the different portions of the civilized 
globe; even some who were eminent in 
science have fallen into the snares of so- 
called Mesmerism — notably Olbers, the dis- 
coverer of a number of asteroids. Mystic 
medical doctrines founded upon Mesmer's 
views still continue in certain circles, though

the majority have lonj imbed to 

the advances of scientific psychology. — In 
this connection it is proper to speak i^f the 
revived interest in "animal magnetism M due 
to the researches of Doctor James Braid, of 
Manchester, England This gentleman in 
published a work which pretty thor- 
oughly exposed the fallacies of the doctrine 
of Mesmer, and expounded many of the 
truths that were entangled therein. He was 
among the first, perhaps, to employ the 
phrase "animal magnetism," and was the 
author of the term "hypnotism," though in 
ty the popular title was BraUism. 
During the middle of the eighteenth cen- 
tury arose a doctrine that in its novelty, ease 
of practical application, and apparent consist- 
ency (through the ingenious employment of 
certain vital phenomena), secured such a hold 
that its iniluence continued even into the pres- 
ent century. This was the "Brunonian doc- 
trine," promulgated and upheld by the great 
foe and rival of Cullen, Doctor John Brown. 
In youth very precocious, though of most 
humble birth, Doctor Brown had mastered 
the Latin language at the early age of seven 
years, and three years later essayed to learn 
a trade. At the age of twenty he left his na- 
tive village of Dunse for Edinburgh, seeking 
employment as a tutor and intending to study 
theology. Poverty soon compelled him, how- 
ever, to take a rural school, but he returned 
a few years later (in 1759) to the Scottish 
Athens and began the study of medicine, 
supporting himself meantime by rendering 
theses into Latin and by teaching, translat- 
ing, and quizzing. Finally he attracted the 
attention of Cullen, to whom he became use- 
ful through his knowledge of the classics; 
but ultimately a foolish quarrel made bitter 
enemies of the former friends. In 1770, in 
private lectures, Brown began to advance the 
theory to which he had been led by one of his 
own attacks of gout that disappeared under 
the use of stimulants, the disease before 
having always been aggravated by the treat- 
ment prescribed and that was held to be 
orthodox, viz., antiphlogistic. He had now 
become somewhat dissolute, and the students 
he gathered about him were of very much the 
same character; but they formed the nidus 
of a great following opposed to Cullen, 
and quarreled on all occasions with the 



adherents of the latter. Finally Doctor 
Brown removed to 1 ondon, where fortune 
• d to smile upon him, as he gained rap- 
idly in reputation and practice; indeed, he 
barely missed a call to Berlin, and another to 
Padua, as a teacher, the scale being turned 
against him by his dissolute habits. Though 
possessed of the highest mental gifl 
was unfortunate in lack of mental stamina. 
He taught that life is not a natural condition, 
but an artificial and necessary result of con- 
stant irritations; all living beings, then 
tend toward death. Health is an interme- 
diate grade of excitement; diseases, which 
'her sthenic or asthenic, represent either 
too high or too low a grade of excitement. 
It has been said that Brown's teachings 
slaughtered more human beings than the 
French Revolution and the wars of Napoleon 
combined. In England this system found no 
important followers, but in America Benja- 
min Rush of Philadelphia ( 1 745—1 Si 5) dis- 
tinguished himself as an adherent. In Spain 
and France it found little place; but in Italy, 
and later in Germany, it secured a numerous 
and important following, which numbered, 
among others, Scarpa, Massini, and Girtan- 
ner. 

Another system which attained influential 
development, extending even into the pres- 
ent century, was the so-called Realism, origi- 
nated by Pinel (1745— 1836). Born in poverty^ 
and designed for the Roman Catholic church, 
Pinel did not turn his attention to medicine 
until his thirtieth year, but on completing his 
studies he rapidly rose to positions of import- 
ance. Led to the investigation of mental 
diseases by the fate of one of his particular 
friends, who had become insane, escaped into 
the forest, and was there devoured by wolves, 
Pinel speedily developed a great interest in 
this class of sufferers. The lot of the insane 
at this time was most pitiable: they were im- 
prisoned, chained, and treated worse than 
wild beasts. In his efforts to improve their 
lot, Pinel acquired the title of conservative 
and aristocrat, either of which was almost 
equivalent to a death sentence. Cnterrified, 
however, he appeared before the Paris Coun- 
cil and urged the adoption of reformatory 
measures, replying to the challenges of skep- 
tical and self-regardful opponents by liberat- 
ing a nuraber of insane patients who were in

his charge. The courage thus exhibited 
receives appreciation in our time, if never 
before. Not the least of Pinel's services was 
the substitution of analytical for synthetic 
methods; he also sought to determine disease 
by a diagnosis carefully constructed from 
symptoms, but unfortunately he made pathol- 
ogy and anatomy subordinate factors. A 
pupil of Barthez, he placed his preceptor's 
vitalism far in the background. 

Francois Bichat, born in 1771, earned high 
rank both as a clinician and an anatomist. 
His education was begun in Nantes, but he 
studied surgery and anatomy in Lyons and 
Montpellier, subsequently going to Paris, 
where he became a member of Desault's 
family. After the death of his patron he 
lectured on surgery, and from 1797 on an- 
atomy. Possessed of a feverish scientific 
activity, he became a member of the Societe 
d'Emulation. Death overtook him in 1802 
as the sequel of consumption and an injury 
received through a fall. He was the most 
capable physician of France in his time, 
and, brief as was his span of life, he was 
author of nine important volumes, the chief 
of which were a "Treatise on Membranes" 
and works on General and Pathological 
Anatomy. From the latter a new tendency 
in study took origin. He it was that gave 
utterance to the aphorism: "Take away 
some fevers and nervous troubles, and all 
else falls to the kingdom of pathological 
anatomy." As an evidence of his energy, it 
is related that he in one winter examined 
700 bodies. He taught how to discriminate 
between disease processes, — notably subdi- 
vided peri-pneumonia into pleurisy, pneu- 
monia, and bronchitis, these having been 
previously confounded. He once remarked: 
'You may observe disease of the heart, lungs, 
abdominal viscera, etc., night and morning, 
jy the sick-bed, for twenty years, yet the whole 
: urnishes merely a jumble of phenomena 
which unite in nothing complete; but if you 
)pen a few bodies, you will see the obscurity 
speedily give way — a result never accom- 
plished by observation if we do not know the 
ieat of the disease." To Bichat is also due 
)ur modern recognition of cellular, osseous, 
ibrous, and other tissues, as such, wherever 
hey appear throughout the body. He differ- 
entiated, without the aid of the microscope, 



twenty-one different tissues as simple and 
similar elements of the body, enumerating 
them as one does the chemical elements; he 
described the stomach as composed of mucous, 
serous, and muscular layers; overthrew the 
speculative tendency of medicine and placed 
facts in the front rank; and so conspicuous 
were his services that he has been termed 
the "Napoleon of Medicine." He supple- 
mented the influence of Pinel upon the side 
of pathological anatomy; called sensibility 
and contractility vital properties, whose altera- 
tions constitute disease, claiming, however, 
that the vital properties of individual tissues 
differed among themselves. His life and 
works are revelations to young men, and 
show what can be accomplished at a very 
early age by sufficiently active and harmo- 
niously developed brains. 

In reviewing the theories and lives of those 
mentioned as medical luminaries of the eigh- 
teenth century, one experiences a feeling of 
mingled respect and disappointment — re- 
spect for the devoted way in which they 
worked and sought the truth, and disappoint- 
ment at so much waste of intellectual power 
and labor. — The lesson is also taught, and 
should be impressed, that in all so-called new 
systems old principles for the most part re- 
appear, and that the labors of the past are 
rarely so deliberately consulted as to guard 
against the repetition and revamping of the- 
ories that had long before been proved futile. 

Let me now mention a few other of the 
physicians of the last century who have left 
more or less of an impress upon their succes- 
sors and upon our science. One man, in 
particular, historians are wont to remember 
with the honor that was denied him by his 
colleagues and contemporaries. I refer to 
Leopold Avenbrugger, who was born in Graz 
in 1722, and who, after pursuing his philo- 
sophical and professional studies in his native 
city, obtained, at the age of twenty-nine, 
charge of a Spanish military hospital; while 
thus employed he invented the art of per- 
cussion as applied to diagnosis. This he 
gave the test of experience during seven long 
years before making it known to the profes- 
sion, and even then it was not appreciated, 
but remained practically unnoticed until after 
his death, which occurred in 1809. He did 
receive a patent of nobility from the Emperor

sounds and specula; Sanl 
ance, counted the pulse, and resorted to the 
• the thermometer; Boerhaavc employed 

the thermometer and the simple lens; 1 
and after him Mailer, utilized the watch in 
marking seconds; a Salernian practitioner- 
utilized auscultation and percussion in tym- 
panites and ascites; but the diagnosis of 
ises of the great viscera by percussion 
was never known before Avenbrugger. His 
booklet of twenty-two pages, unsalable in his 
time, is today held worth far more than its 
weight in gold. His famous colleague, I)e 
rlaen, wrote fifteen volumes without a word 
on percussion; Van Swieten did it no greater 
justice; in his great treatise on the History 
of Medicine, Sprengel barely alludes to it; 
yet the contents of Avenbrugger's booklet 
were of more practical value than all that 
these other men ever wrote, or all the results 
of the vast and bloody campaigns during 
which it slept. In 1S08 this volume was res- 
cued from oblivion by Corvisart, who trans- 
lated it into French and proclaimed its undy- 
ing value. 

I )uring the earlier part of this century lived 
Werlhof of Helmstadt (i 699-1 767), a far- 
famed observer, author, and practitioner, who 
declined a professorship, and especially dis- 
tinguished himself as a writer of German 
poetry. Though possessed of an exceptional 
knowledge of modern tongues, he wrote only 
in Latin, the scientific language of the day. 
In 1734 he was appointed physician to King 
George II., in which position he attained 
world-wide fame, while indefatigable in his 
efforts to elevate science. He first described 
the disease known by his name — morbus 
maculosus Werlhofii, — and struggled hard to 
establish in Germany the use of cinchona. 

From 1740 to 1802 flourished VVichman of 
Hanover, highly esteemed as a writer and 
practitioner. He is especially known for his 
pleas in favor of more scientific diagnoses, 
and his demonstration of how to make them. 
The role of the itch-mite in the transmission 
of scabies he demonstrated upon himself: 
To be sure, Bonomo, a hundred years before, 
had called attention thereto, but with little 
avail. 



Anothei at Hanoverian was the 

fickle, stubborn and misanthropic Zimmer- 
man, born in 172S in i . d whom mis- 
fortune and disease played many shabby 
tricks. lie was. however, a man of ingen- 
ious endowments, and merits especial regard 
because he sought to free medical science 
from the charge ot" being a secret art. 

Another of the prodigies of medical history 
was J. P. Frank, born (1725) in the I'.avanan 
Palatinate, of pauper parents, and while an 
infant abandoned by a cruel father. His 
early life ised in a religious school; at 

the age of twenty-five he became a court and 
garrison physician, and later a professor in 
Gottingen; finally went to Vienna, where he 
died in 1801. He was greatly beloved by his 
pupils, and Walther, the famous surgeon, said 
of him: " No one ever made so elevating and 
permanent an impression on me." He pub- 
lished an extensive work on forensic medi- 
cine and sanitation — wherein he took up the 
hygiene of the individual, of the family, and 
of the school — which constituted an effort 
far ahead of anything of the kind previously 
known. He is also memorable for efforts 
toward increasing the population, for the 
Thirty Years' War had depopulated exten- 
sive districts — to such a degree, indeed, that 
in 1750 bigamy was legalized in Nuremberg 
and many other towns. Frank was distil 
guished for a keen and even caustic humoi 
whose subject was not unfrequently himseH 

From 1707 to 1782 there lived in Englan&lt; 
one Sir John Pringle, chief of the Ami 
Medical Department, known to this day 
an author upon military hygiene. John 
Huxham (1794-1S68) advanced our knowl- 
edge of putrid dissolution of the blood. John 
Howard (1 766-1 790) rendered eminent ser- 
vice in prison reform. Heberden (171c 
1801) was the first to describe varicella, and 
also angina pectoris — which was long known 
as Heberden's asthma. John Fothergil (17 12 
-1780), a Quaker, acquired fame by his 
servations on chronic angina, neuralgia, anc 
hydrocephalus; was likewise a benefactor of 
the poor, regarding them as "bridges to the 
pockets of the rich;" indeed, a large part of 
what he gained from the latter class h&lt; 
bestowed in charity, and at his death left 
^200,000 for the same purpose. Radclifie 
(i 750-1814) was an eminent, witty, successful

practitioner of London, who was wont to 
declare that as a young practitioner he pos- 
sessed twenty remedies for every disease, but 
at the close of his career had found twenty 
diseases for which he had not one remedy. 
Richard Mead (1673-1754) was a prolific 
writer and the author of the first quarantine 
regulations adopted in England. Contem- 
porary with Mead was Lettsom, the busiest, 
most philanthropic and most successful physi- 
cian of his day, whose practice brought him 
$60,000 a year, although a large part of it 
was gratuitous, and who gave away immense 
sums for charitable purposes; also Thomas 
Dover, who invented the sedative known by 
his name, and who died in 1741. Akenside, 
physician and poet (1721-1770), wrote on 
dysentery. Baillie, of Edinburgh, was the 
first to accurately describe the morbid anat- 
omy of gastric ulcer. 

Among the French surgeons must be men- 
tioned La Peyronie, of Montpellier, born in 
1668, and who ultimately became director of 
the Academy of Surgery and surgeon to the 
King. His wealth was employed for the 
elevation of the craft, and he founded no 
less than ten different surgical professorships 
at his own expense. In 1743 he effected the 
separation of the surgeons from the barbers. 
He died in 1747, dedicating his estate to the 
purpose for which he had lived. The most 
.famous of the earlier surgeons of this century 
was J. L Petit (1674-1750), inventor of the 
'screw tourniquet, and who was sent for to 
•treat Augustus the Strong, of Poland; indeed, 
several other crowned heads became his pa- 
rents. Garengeot (1 688-1 759) was a profes- 
sor in the College of St. Come, and published 
1 work on operative surgery. Morand (1697- 
773) and Le Dran were distinguished sur- 
geons of Paris, the former especially noted 
or the number of times he performed para- 
centesis. Famous lithomotists were Le Cat 
.nd Frere Come — whose real name was 
iaseilhac, and who operated by means of 
he lithotorae cache. Astruc (1685-1766) 
ras a syphilographer of extensive attain- 
lent; Quesnay (1694-1774), an eminent and 
ndaunted surgeon of Louis XV., who wrote 
n the history and progress of surgery in 
ranee; Brasdor (1721-1776) was best known 
)r his method of distal ligation in aneurysm; 
abatier (1 732-181 1) wrote a famous treatise 



on operations in which he recommended re- 
section of the head of the humerus. 

One of the most celebrated surgeons was 
P. J. Desault (1744-1795), the son of a poor 
farmer, originally designed for the priest- 
hood, but who, after obtaining a thorough 
mathematical education, began the study of 
surgery with an ignorant master of his native 
town. Subsequently he went to Paris, and 
here supported himself by teaching, grad- 
ually rising step by step until, without col- 
legiate education, he became professor and 
chief surgeon at the Hotel Dieu, where he 
established the first surgical clinic. He op- 
posed violently the prevalent abuse of the 
trephine, and was also a champion of heal- 
ing by first intention. A trusted friend of 
Desault was Chopart, well known because of 
the amputation of the foot that bears his 
name. Another well known surgeon, like- 
wise a friend of Desault, was Doublet: and 
it is somewhat remarkable that Desault, 
Chopart and Doublet suffered persecution 
and perhaps martyrdom in connection with 
the supposed death of the dauphin of France, 
properly Louis XVII:, in 1795. There is 
evidence that the child who died in the 
Temple was not the dauphin, but a substi- 
tute, and these three surgeons who examined 
the corpse had the hardihood to express their 
doubts. The same day that Desault reported 
upon the evidence, he was invited to dinner 
by some members of the Convention, was 
taken ill at the table, and died almost im- 
mediately after his return home. A few days 
later Chopart and Doublet died, also under 
mysterious circumstances. 

Daviel (1 796-1 862) is remembered among 
French surgeons chiefly for extraction of the 
lens as an independent method of treating 
cataract; Tenon (1724-1816), for his writings 
on the anatomy and diseases of the eye; and 
Anel, for originating the operation for aneur- 
ysm, mistakenly attributed to Hunter. There 
were also many others of lesser note who dis- 
tinguished themselves through special ser- 
vices to surgery or some of its branches. 

Among the Italians of this century may be 
mentioned Scarpa (1772-1832), of Motta, 
professor successively in Modena and Pavia, 
and who advanced our knowledge of hernia, 
diseases of the eyes, aneurysm, and genera! 
anatomy. 






TH E MEDICAL AGE. 



The most famous Spanish was 

Gimbemat, of Madrid (1742-1 79c &gt;, for a time 
professor in Ba ime dis- 

tinguished through anatomical researches. 

man surgeons did not rank high during 
the earlier half of the last century, owing to 
the contempt engendered for this branch of 
the medical art by the church. The fashion 
of imitating the French, however, led tosomc 
surgical development. The first German 
surgeon of scientific education was Heister 
&gt;f Frankfort-on- the- Main, who, 
unable to obtain honorable employment in 
the military service of his own country, en- 
tered that of Holland, where he remained 
until the experience of his own nation had 
brought about a healthy reaction. In 172c 
he came to Helmstadt, where he developed 
great activity in anatomy, surgery, and bot- 
any; also distinguished himself as a dentist 
and oculist, and discussed the whole range of 
surgical topics from the least to the greatest. 

Bilguer (1720-1796)7 of Chur, became sur- 
geon-general in Berlin, and performed the 
first resection of the wrist in 1762; he was an 
opponent of amputation, which at that time 
was altogether too frequently practiced. 

Von Siebold (1 736-1807) was the founder 
of an institution for surgical instruction, 
where for the first time in Germany surgery 
was taught clinically. He became one of the 
most famous teachers and was first in his 
native land to perform the operation of sym- 
physiotomy, so recently revived. 

The greatest German surgeon of the eigh- 
teenth century, however — one eminent both 
as writer and operator — was August Gottlieb 
Richter (1742-1S12), of Zorbig, a descendant 
of a ministerial family, who wrote a famous 
work on hernia, and greatly improved all 
branches of surgery; he it was that enun- 
ciated the principle of dressing wounds 
"quickly, easily, and rarely." 

Among English surgeons of the century 
must be mentioned first of all Cheselden 
(1688-1752), whose name is inseparably con- 
nected with anatomy and pathology as well 
as surgery. At first a warm advocate of the 
high operation for stone, his dexterity in 
lithotomy excited the wonder of his con- 
temporaries. He published a treatise on 
anatomy, and one on the supra-pubic sec- 
tion. 



Alexander Monro, Sr. 1 1 
inburj eminent in both anal 

and surgery, and COntribut 

other one man to the success and reputation 

of the Scottish medical school. Hii 

Alexander and Donald, and his grandson 
Alexander 3d, were equally celebrated in 
anatomy. 

Charles White, of Manch&lt; generally 

credited with having performed, in 1768, 
the first subperiosteal resection of the head 
of the humerus, although as a matter of fact 
this was not done until 1774, and then by 
Bent of Newcastle. He also performed re- 
section of the hip-joint upon the cadaver — 
another of the same name, Anthony White, 
having done the operation upon the living 
subject in 1721. He invented the method of 
reducing dislocation of the humerus with the 
foot in the axilla — a procedure that is ordi- 
narily as&lt; ribed to Sir Astley Cooper; also 
operations for false joint by the removal of 
the involved surfaces of the bone. 

It will be seen that the excision of joint 
was peculiarly an English method, the elbows 
joint having been first excised in 175 
Wainman, and the knee-joint by Filkin of 
Northwich. The man who permanently at-, 
tracted the attention of surgeons to thes 
new operations was Henry Park, a bold sur- 
geon, who wrote in 1782. The merits 
these methods were then soon forgotten, ho^ 
ever, and were revived in the present c&lt; 
tury by Liston and Syme. 

One of the best known London surge( 
was Percival Pott (1 749-1 7S7), who becat 
especially eminent through his studies u| 
hernia, spinal disease, and diseases of boi 
and joints; his complete chirurgical worl 
appeared in London in 1771. 

William Hunter (17 18-1783), of Scot 
parentage, originally a theological student 
and a pupil of Cullen, went to London 
1741, began to lecture on anatomy ai 
gery in 1746, and soon acquired a great repi 
tation as a surgeon, obstetrician, and am 
mist. He achieved enormous success 11 
practice, and spent ^100,000 upon his hoi 
library, and private collections. The latte 
now forms the Hunterian museum in th« 
University of Glasgow. His magnificent plate 
illustrating the gravid uterus required th 
labors of twenty years, and appeared in 177. 



THE MEDICAL AGE.

John Hunter (1728-1793), younger brother 
of William, enjoyed even greater reputation 
than the latter. He was a pupil not only of 
his brother, but also of Cheselden and Pott. 
Beginning the practice of surgery in 1763, he 
became surgeon to St. George's Hospital in 
1768, and surgeon-general of the English 
forces in 1 790. So memorable were the labors 
and services of this man that at the Royal 
College of Surgeons of London there is given 
annually a " Hunterian oration," intended in 
some way to commemorate his labors or to 
draw some lesson from his life and work. 
To do justice to John Hunter would require 
a volume, hence we must at present dismiss 
the subject with this brief reference. 

Almost equally famous as a surgeon, though 
[ by no means such an omnivorous student as 
': Hunter, was Benjamin Bell, of Edinburgh, 
■ who died in 1806. He employed tubes of 
lead and silver for the purpose of drainage. 
Sir Charles, and John Bell, also of Edinburgh, 
are eminent names pertaining to the latter 
part of the eighteenth and first part of the 
nineteenth century. The latter was professor 
1 of anatomy, surgery and obstetrics, a busy 
practitioner, a fertile writer, and not only one 
of the most successful operators of his day, 
ibut an excellent classical scholar; his "Prin- 
ciples of Surgery" appeared from 1801 to 
1807. Sir Charles, who died in 1842, belongs 
1 more to the present century, but was equally 
distinguished as an operator, surgeon, and 
writer, and best known, perhaps, for his 
Bridgewater Treatise on the Hand. 

Among the Dutch an eminent surgeon was 
Peter Camper (1722-1789), who, in order to 
acquire manual dexterity, learned to use vari- 
ous mechanical tools. He was a fruitful 
luthor, and did not consider it beneath his 
dignity to write a treatise about the best 
form of shoes, published in Vienna in 1782, 
)ut recently translated and republished in 
England as something new. Sandifort, of 
^eyden, discussed ruptures, dislocations, etc., 
ind reported the first observation of down- 
vard dislocation of the femur. 
As already noted, the surgeons of the 
ighteenth century were often obstetricians 
-William Hunter conspicuously. The most 
mportant obstetrician of his time was William 
&gt;mellie (1680-1763), of London, who in- 
ented numerous instruments, wrote a large 



treatise on the theory and practice of mid- 
wifery, and greatly advanced our knowledge 
of deformed pelves. He was the first to dis- 
tinguish one diameter from the other, and to 
point out the importance of cephalic version 
and version of the breech. — Parenthetically, 
it may be remarked that William Hunter, 
great as he was, was the uncompromising foe 
of instrumental midwifery, and was in the 
habit of showing his forceps, covered with 
rust, as evidence that he never Fesorted to 
such aids. A rival of Smellie and Hunter 
was Thomas Denman (1753- 1815), best 
known, perhaps, because of his demonstra- 
tion of the portability of puerperal infection. 
The researches of anatomists during the 
eighteenth century were for the most part 
directed towards the minute, more difficult, 
and less striking parts, and to increased 
thoroughness and accuracy of description. 
Microscopical anatomy suffered a relative qui- 
escence. Pathological and general anatomy, 
which were destined to control the medicine 
of the succeeding century, were newly cre- 
ated, and not yet regarded as sciences by 
themselves, but merely as special branches. 
The most important feature was the revival 
and more accurate study of experimental 
physiology, which had been scarcely resorted 
to since the time of Galen, except for Har- 
vey's discoveries. This revival, which really 
seemed an epoch in the history of medicine, 
was effected by the great Haller (1 708-1 777), 
of Berne, a man who really deserved the title 
of "Great," as he was a universal and inde- 
fatigable savant, possessed of thorough con- 
scientiousness, marvellous capacity for work, 
great ingenuity, natural endowments, and an 
inextinguishable love for art and science; he 
was certainly one of the most versatile schol- 
ars and thinkers of any time, distinguished 
not only in his chosen field of medicine, but 
as a poet, botanist, and statesman. Like all 
Swiss poets, he never 'passed beyond the 
didactic and the homely in his versification. 
From his tenth year he wrote poems in Latin 
and German, and even when eight years old 
had made most extensive compilations from 
Bayle's dictionary. At fifteen he went to the 
University of Tubingen, where in the second 
year of his sojourn he disputed with one of 
his teachers. In 1725 he went to Leyden, 
where Boerhaave and Albinus found in him

a most indefatigable follower. At nil 

he received the degree of Doctor. In the

had dissected; and while in l'aris he 

ged in grave robbing, and, being be- 
trayed by his own careli - com- 
LVC himself by flight In many 
other States and in more than one country 
1 with the best of teachers, lector- 

• times himself. At the age of twenty- 
six he became prof essor and hospital director 
at Berne, and in 175J published his famous 
irritability. Three years later 
he accepted a call to (iottingen as professor 
of anatomy, surgery, chemistry, and botany. 
He was the founder of a botanical garden; 
for many years was so busy that he slept and 
lived in his library; and in spite of his enor- 
mous and unique correspondence with the 
savants of the world, he never left a letter 
unanswered. Strange to say, his permanent 
influence upon the practice of medicine was 
only indirect; and although he was professor 
of surgery, and performed many vivisections, 
he was never able to persuade himself to per- 
form a single surgical operation upon the liv- 
ing human being. He it was that introduced 
into Germany the use of the watch in count- 
ing the pulse. Like Hunter, Haller demands 
a special historian, and it is possible here to 
outline only a few of the services he rendered 
to medicine. He enriched the anatomy of the 
heart, of the brain and dura, and pointed out 
the venous nature of the sinuses; taught that 
the uterus should be regarded as a muscle; 
advanced the knowledge of the lymphatic 
system, and believed in and taught a devel- 
opmental theory that every individual is 
descended or derived from a preceding one. 
In the mechanism of the heart, his doctrine 
of irritability especially maintained itself. 
He administered the death-blow to the doc- 
trine of vital spirits, and was in fact the father 
of modern nerve physiology. His doctrine of 
irritability moved the minds of his century in 
a way that has no parallel, unless we compare 
it with the doctrine of Darwin. Glisson had 
established the general principles of irritabil- 
ity; and Haller followed, teaching it by the 
inductive method, and proving its existence 
by experiments — proving, moreover, that it

researches deserve the more credil

advantages. The profound impression made 

by llaller's teachings may be measured by 

the number of his supporters and opponents; 

at man, second in v 
influence only to Hoerhaave, and one who 
left a more lasting impress upon the world 
than even the latter. 

The two best known of Haller's oppoi 
were: Wolf ( 1 733-1 794) , of St. Petersburg,! 
who regarded each generation as an actual] 
new creation, and was the first to teach the 
doctrine of the blastodermic membranes;) 
and Blumenbach (1752-1840), of Gotha. who 
did great service by investigations in g&lt;. 
anthropology, of which he was in fact the 
founder, and whose researches in compara- 
tive anatomy and the history of development 
have rendered him famous. 

Of the famous anatomists of the centui 
may be mentioned Sommerring (1 755—1 83c 
of Frankfort, the first to distinguish l\ 
facial and auditory nerves from each oth&lt; 
and whose published works are well kno\ 
because of the beautiful illustrations 
nished him by the well known artist Koe&lt; 

The ablest French anatomist of the cei 
tury was Winslow (1669-1760), a man 
Danish birth, but who became a professor 
Paris, and is best known by the foram&lt; 
named for him. There were also Poi 
(1 742-1832), physician to Louis XVIII., wl 
wrote a famous history on anatomy and si 
gery; and Vicq d'Azyr (1 748-1794), knoi 
equally well for his labors in the departm&lt; 
of anatomy, especially of the brain, nervou« 
system, and vocal organs. Bichat (alreadj 
mentioned) would deserve to be placed 
the head of French anatomists were it n( 
for his superior rank in clinical medicine. 

The founder of pathological anatonn 
science was Morgagni, born in 1682 in Forli 
Italy, a pupil of Valsalva, and at the age 
nineteen the assistant of the latter. It 
not until his seventy-ninth year, after he 
published several works, that he allowed hi

famous work on pathological anatomy to ap- 
pear. — This is the historical classic, "De Sedi- 
bus et Causis Morborum" published in Venice 
in 1761. Its famous author did not cease 
work even when he became blind, and to 
him we owe the maxim that observations 
should be "weighed, not counted." He was 
very versatile and well informed in all 
branches of science and literature, and pos- 
sessed a remarkable memory; likewise was 
the first to devote attention extensively and 
thoroughly to the anatomical products of 
common diseases, since before his time little 
had been regarded but rare discoveries in 
the body. He also called attention to the 
important bearing which the history of the 
disease has toward its products, and found 
his discoveries of advantage even when they 
were unable to promote the cure of disease, 
because of the light which they threw upon 
physiology and normal anatomy, and because 
they prevented incurable patients from being 
xmtinually tormented with drugs intended 
bo cure them; also because pathological in- 
vestigations alone could settle disputes in 
liagnosis and matters of honor among physi- 
:ians. He died in 1772. 

Morgagni's legitimate successors in Great 

kitain were Baillie (1761-1823), a son of 

ohn Hunter's sister, and Sir Everard Home, 

lunter's brother-in-law, who became profes- 

i tor in the Royal College of Surgeons, and 

/as entrusted by Hunter with the work of 

escribing his collection. Home, however, in 

1 most discreditable way burned several 

olumes of Hunter's own descriptions in order 

) appropriate to himself the sole credit of 

»e work. He has gone down to fame espe- 

ally because of his book on the prostate. 

One of the most notable events in the his- 

&gt;ry of medicine was the introduction of the 

sternatic practice of Preventive Inoculation 

ainst Smallpox. It is so generally taught 

at this is entirely due to the efforts of Jen- 

t — or rather, we are so often allowed to 

ink it without being taught otherwise — that 

e measure deserves a historical sketch. 

ie communication of the natural disease to 

je healthy in order to afford protection— or, 

\ other words, the communication of small- 

ijx to prevent the same — reaches back into 

Uiquity. It is mentioned in the Sanscrit 

"Mas as performed by Brahmins, who em- 



ployed pus procured from smallpox vesicles 
a year before. They rubbed the place se- 
lected for operation until the skin was red, 
then scratched with a sharp instrument, and 
laid upon it cotton soaked in the variolous 
pus, moistened with water from the sacred 
Ganges. Along with this measure they in- 
sisted upon careful hygienic regulations, to 
which in large measure their good results 
were due. Among the Chinese was practiced 
what was known as "pock-sowing," and ten 
centuries before Christ the Celestials intro- 
duced into the nasal cavities of young children 
pledgets of cotton saturated with variolous 
pus. The Arabians inoculated with needles, 
and so did the Circassians, while in North 
Africa incisions were made between the fin- 
gers, and among some of the negroes inocula- 
tion was performed in or upon the nose In 
Constantinople, under the Greeks, the custom 
had long been naturalized, and was practiced 
by old women instructed in the art, who re- 
garded it as a revelation of Saint Mary. The 
first accounts of this practice were given to 
the Royal Society by Timoni, a physician of 
Constantinople, in 17 14. The actual intro- 
duction of the practice into the West, how- 
ever, was due to Lady Mary Wortley Mon- 
tagu, who died in 1762, and who was wife 
of the English ambassador to the Porte in 
1717. She had her son inoculated in Con- 
stantinople by Maitland, and on her return 
to London, in 1721, her daughter also was 
inoculated. During the same years experi- 
ments were undertaken by Maitland upon 
criminals, and, as these turned out favorably, 
the Prince of Wales and his sisters were 
inoculated by Mead. The practice was then 
more or less speedily adopted on this side of 
the Atlantic, but suffered occasional severe 
blows because of unfortunate cases here and 
there, such as never can be avoided. The 
clergy, especially, using the Scripture as de- 
signing men can always do, became warm 
opponents of the practice, and stigmatized it 
as an atrocious invasion of the divine pre- 
rogative. Nevertheless, in 1746 the Bishop 
of Worcester recommended it from the pulpit, 
established houses for inoculation, and thus 
made it again popular. In Germany it was 
generally favored, and a little later came 
into vogue in France and Italy. In 1757 
Robert Sutton, near London, professed to

have made 15,000 inoculations without 
single fatal case: he kept his patients on strict 
diet for nine days, then inoculated with the 
smallest possible quantity of virus. The op- 
eration was not prohibited in England until 

.:, although it involved much greater 
dangers than vaccination with COWpoz. 

The first inoculation with COWpOI seems to 
have been performed in 1774 by a farmer of 
Ster, named Jestv, though the pioneer 
in the extensive and general introduction of 
this method was Edward Jenner (1749-1823), 
&lt;&gt;f Berkeley in Gloucestershire, who therefore 

generally known as the " Father of Vacci- 
nation." The son of a clergyman, he began 
early the study of medicine and surgery, and 
during his apprenticeship received from a 
milkmaid information of the protective power 
of cowpox against variola, as established In- 
popular observation. (Sutton and others had 
proved that inoculation with sheepyox was 
not efficient.) This communication so struck 
Jenner as a means of affording protection to 
the whole human race, that the subject never 
after left his mind. In 1770 he became a 
pupil of John Hunter, and when he commu- 
nicated to him this idea the great surgeon 
said: " Do not think; investigate." Accord- 
ingly he went to Berkeley and performed the 
little operation which has made him famous; 
and from 1778 untd 1788 he communicated 
to Sir Everard Home such observations as 
he had made. But his first vaccination was 
performed in 1796, upon a boy, with matter 
from the hand of a maid who had contracted 
cowpox in milking. In 1 798 he published his 
memorable work, and afterward removed to 
London. He died full of fame and honor, in 
his native place, having received rewards 
from the government amounting to $150,000, 
besides being an honorary citizen of the City 
of London. The subsequent widespread prac- 
tice of the method, and the formation of 
societies for the promotion of vaccination, 
are matters of recent history. 

The first vaccinations in the United States 
were performed by Doctor Waterhouse, pro- 
fessor of medicine in Harvard College, in 
1800, upon four of his own children. The 
transmission of humanized virus through the 
system of the cow, and its subsequent em- 
ployment in vaccination of human beings, 
was first practiced by Troja (1747-1827), of 



Naples, shortly after the introduction 
human vaccination; but in 1810 this v 
prohibited in Italy. Compulsory vaccination 
was first extensively introduced in Germany 

in 1S07; in England it was first legalised in 
The occasional temporary ter of 

the protection thus afforded was first taught 
by Klsasser in 1S14. Schoenlein was th&lt; 
to call attention to the distinction be' 
variola and varioloid. 

Another matter in which the eighteenth cen- 
tury witnessed great reform was the , 
merit of the Insane, which continued in very 
bad condition until toward the close of the 
century, when a movement for improvement | 
began. From and after this, lunatics were 
liberated from their fetters and from the hands 
of brutal keepers, and regarded as actually ill, 
while so-called schools of psychiatry were 
founded. While the first impulse in this 
direction was given by Lorry, the true re- 
former was Pinel, already mentioned, who 
did away with corporeal punishment and 
abuse, separated the insane from convicts, 
limited the employment of drugs and espe- 
cially of venesection, placed the unfortunates 
in special institutions under the charge of 
physicians, and classified patients accordii 
to their symptoms. Yet, in spite of 
humane teachings, lunatics were found 11 
carcerated in cages in some of the Fren&lt; 
cities as late as 1834. Pinel was followed 
Esquirol (1 772-1840), who in 1818 establishe 
the first clinic for mental diseases. 

It is well known what a conspicuous pi 
Public Baths played in the social life of tl 
ancient Greeks and Romans, but the fii 
public resort for sea-bathing was establish 
in Germany in 1794. The cold-water ep( 
of this century, however, began with the 
searches of Hahn (1696-1773), a Silesii 
who introduced a systematic and alm&lt; 
exclusive hydrotherapeutic method. Th&lt; 
modern method of using cold water as 
antipyretic agent was first employed in Enj 
land, in 1797, by Currie, who originally was; 
American merchant. In France the meth&lt; 
found little sympathy, but it made its wa; 
even to Spain later, where it was adopted b; 
the famous Sangrado, who is well known t&lt; 
readers of "Gil Bias."

GLASS HOUSES. 

Unless we are greatly in error, the defi- 
nition of quackery includes the perverting, 
distorting and strangling of legitimate medi- 
cine, for personal ends. Is it not notorious 
that there are a number of superficial ob- 
servers and ready writers who are guilty of 
this very fault, in that they are ever ready to 
give evidence in favor of any preparation the 
contents and composition of which are con- 
cealed by trademark or patent, and of whose 
therapeutic and physiological action they are 
necessarily utterly ignorant — and that, too, in 
ivery conceivable form of disease or injury, 
•egardless of rhyme or reason ? . If this is 
rue, it is not only most reprehensible, but 
:onstitutes most dangerous charlatanism. 

The greatest of all nuisances are, perhaps, 
he claiming of new and absurd properties in 
emedies, and making of each and every one a 
sanacea. Just recall the history of Glycerin, 
?hich came into use half a century since, and 
egarding the merits of which the medical 
ress was crammed to overflowing. From 
very part of the country, in every number of 
very journal, for nearly a year, were reiter- 
ted the wonderful uses to which Glycerin 
3uld be put, both as an internal medicament 
id as an external application; and it is no 
taggeration to say it was recommended for 
ne-tenths of the diseases in the nosology 
gardless of aetiology or pathology. Its 
soothing and anodyne properties as an eye- 
ash, devoid of all irritation," were vouched 
r by scores and scores; in phthisis it was 
und to be "a most excellent succedaneum 



for cod-liver oil;" in intestinal fluxes it com- 
bined all the advantages of a tonic, an 
astringent, an alterative, and a cathartic; by 
its external application all forms of skin dis- 
ease were guaranteed to disappear as by 
magic— indeed, by giving credence to half of 
what was published regarding this drug, one 
could arrive at no conclusion save that the 
entire materia medica, excepting Glycerin, 
coulel now be dispensed with; and notably, 
amongst all this flood of positive evidence, 
not one word of negative ever found its way 
into print. 

That very valuable remedy, Iron Perchlor- 
ide, ran the same gauntlet, came very near 
being swamped, and to-day requires a long 
chapter of negatives to restore it to its proper 
place and estimation. 

As an instance of the confusion to which 
positive evidence may lead, the experience 
of a practitioner who was appointed chair- 
man of a committee to report to his State 
Medical Society on the action of Quinine, 
may be cited: 

I soon found it impossible. I became satisfied 
that I could produce good authority to prove Qui- 
nine possessed of almost every power attributed to 
each of the common classes of medicine, and also 
to prove it a specific — or next thing thereto — not 
alone in every disease of the nosology, but in every 
stage of every disease. There was no conflicting 
evidence — all was of the most positive type. I 
therefore began to study what Quinine would not 
do, but here could get no assistance; and my own 
experiences and observations were so limited that 
I did not deem them worthy of presentation. 

Many of our readers will doubtless recall 
the fact that some years ago a physician 
in good standing (at all events he subse- 
quently died in the odor of medical sanc- 
tity) reported in an Eastern metropolitan 
journal that in Lupulin he had discovered 
a positive specific for delirium tremens; he 
gave it in large doses — very large — in one 
instance as high as six pounds; and in spite 
of the fact that the ingestion of six pounds 
of Lupulin would cause any ordinary mortal 
to imagine himself stuffed with a bag of bran, 
this extraordinary statement attracted little 
attention. One gentleman, however, ad- 
dressed the reporter for further information, 
but received no reply. He next wrote an 
open letter to the journal, which forced the 
desired information. The discoverer of the

directly, but a hmcture made with

only conclusion permitted the reauler was 
that the patient had ingested at a 

ght the entire three quarts of can . 
— an amount which might be by some con- 
sidered i . even in these days. 

ther bit of evidence of the same class 
rffered by one who assured the profes- 
:hat he never failed in cutting short or 
aborting an attack of gonorrhcra within forty- 
eight hours by the administration every two 
hours of twelve grains of solid extract of 
Conium. This statement was never queried, 
not even by the editor of the journal in which 
cared. It can be imagined "the bury- 
ing o' mistakes six feet under ground," to 
use the words of a witty attorney, must have 
saved cti\ incalculable amount of trouble. 
Possibly a typographical error converted the 
fraction 1-12 or 1-2 into 12. This is the 
most merciful explanation we can guess at, 
though w ; must confess it is a little far- 
fetched in view of the writer's subsequent 
silence. The editor of The Mkdical Agk 
has personally given as high as one-eighth of 
a grain of Conium every two hours for sev- 
eral days in succession, yet no appreciable 
effect upon the genito- urinary apparatus could 
ever be discovered. 

Another and a kindred remedy, (xelsemium, 
had its term of laudation in the same malady 
and in enormous doses, and yet the only in- 
stance that we can record wherein it was of 
benefit was a complication of intermittent 
fever— wath the cessation of the latter there 
was complete relief from the urethritis. 

To declare that a remedy is equally good 
for everything is a very practical assurance of 
its utter worthlessness. Incalculable damage 
is the result — far more than if not a line had 
been written, since in the latter instance 
honest research would be stimulated. In- 
deed, most of the items concerning the varied 
powers of a remedy are published after only 
successful case, and those who write 
thereof are in the main incapable of distin- 
guishing between physiological phenomenon 
and VtS medicatrix naturcE. It is an anx- 
iety to appear in print and to secure self- 
advertising that induces the adoption of the 



too ready rule of post ho\ ■&gt; hoc; 

and the fact is entir&lt; il &lt;&gt;f that 

charlatanism is doubly vile when pra 
by a member of the legitimate medical pro- 
Q, and that much of the odium attach- 
ing to the profession is due to this very cause 
alone. The complaints justly made n 
ing the exploiting of Glycerin, Iron Perchlor- 
t &lt;//., are to-day applicable to almost 
every article of our materia medica, and 
especially to the synthetics that during the 
last decade have multiplied to a dangerous 
degree. The fashion of reporting cases be- 
fore they are fairly convalescent has b&lt; 
a notorious nuisance, and the disciplining 
power of national, state and county me 
societies should be brought to bear to pre- 
vent, or at least to express marked dissatis- 
faction with, such manufacturing of literature. 

Is it not likewise a marked case of "glass 
house" when the medical press continues to 
bemoan the fact that clergymen permit their 
names to be employed in the puffing and 
marketing of patent medicines? How many 
medical journals to-day can be found that do 
not open their columns to the puffing of pro- 
prietary and patent medicines at the hands 
of the very individuals who are so quick to 
condemn the clergy, or that do not prostitute 
their editorial columns to the dissemination 
of rank falsehoods? Surely the errors com-i 
mitted in the interests of legitimate ther* 
peutics are sufficient. What is the "reading 
notice" but rank deceit? If it were not a 
deceit, the exploiters of proprietary nostrums 
would not require it. These reading notices 
are sent in with the expectation that when 
printed they shall be accepted by the readers 
as editorial utterances. 

Would it not be well, then, to purge our- 
selves of the medical beam before condemn- 
ing the clerical mote ? It is said medical mei 
are rapidly losing caste. Certainly the 
nity of the profession is endangered by pre 
tituting a noble calling and dragging it to 
level so low that both honor and truth an 

ignored.

HOANG NAN. 

This drug, known as " tropical bind-\\&lt; 
and which grows on the mountains betweer 
Anam and Tonquin, is generally in use ir 1 
Cochin China for leprosy. That it belong'

to the strychnine group is evidenced by the 
fact it yields this alkaloid, as well as brucine. 
Doctor Etienne reports that, given to twenty- 
four lepers, " it caused general improvement 
in all but one — the remedy works also simul- 
taneously upon all manifestations of disease 
without exception; upon muscular paralysis 
it seems to produce the least effect." More- 
over, treatment extending over a period of 
two years did not in the least tire the stomach 
or injure the general health. Doctor Gilbot, 
in the Danish West Indies, reports a case of 
leprosy in which "the ulcers yielded rapidly 
to treatment, becoming cicatrized." In India, 
fifteen lepers were treated by Desaint and 
Joboard, who concluded " Hoang Nan is 
an active remedy, destined to be of great 
service, not alone in leprosy but in the man- 
agement of all indolent ulcers." Feron, of 
Poncherry, treated not only leprosy but 
scrofula, with good results, and found the 
drug "especially valuable in the manage- 
ment of ulcers." Fiot, of Tonquin, reported 
.ike success. Lesserteur believes Hoang Nan 
Mil be found equally "efficacious in leprous 
llcerations and syphilitic trouble;" epilepsy, 
prurigo and convulsions are also relieved. 
Vhen pushed to toxicity the drug induces 
onic convulsions that begin always in the 
ower extremities of man, the posterior ex- 
tremities of quadrupeds, gradually extending 
jver the whole body until they become gen- 
ral. It must therefore be classed as a strong 
erebro-spinant. Desaint declares that in 
;prosy it produces "extraordinary improve- 
ment;" that "in two months anaesthesia dis- 
appears and sensibility is once more restored, 
ae patient becoming more active and joyous, 
he complexion peculiar to the disease dis- 
^pears and a rosy hue takes its place." 
: With all this positive information, it cer- 
inly would seem as if the drug were worthy 
I more extensive study than has hitherto 
;en accorded. 



^ISKS IN WEARING ARTIFICIAL EYES. 

Professor Panas, of London, justly enters a 
ptest against the abuse of eye enucleation 
1 frequently met with both in hospital and 
Jneral practice. The deformity so caused is 
l»t prejudicial to the interests of the patient; 
'd further, the operation often provokes the 



very disease against which it is practiced — 
viz., sympathetic ophthalmia — which is infin- 
itely less common than generally represented. 
As a matter of fact, the wearer of a glass 
eye runs great risks of inducing sympathetic 
trouble in the healthy eye from neglect of 
cleanliness in the artificial organ, since from 
such causes the orbit becomes filled with pus, 
ulcers develop, and cicatricial bands form. 
Again, the artificial eye may be fractured or 
roughened; and, having only one, the patient 
continues to wear it although it is a source 
of continual irritation. Many wearers of 
artificial eyes present eversion of the lower 
lid; in others entropion and trichiasis are 
observed. To avoid these inconveniences it 
is desirable the patient be supplied with two 
artificial eyes. At night the eye should be 
placed in an aseptic fluid, and, to obviate dif- 
ficulty in its introduction into the orbit, a 
lubricant of like character should be em- 
ployed. 

The best means of preventing the forma- 
tion of cicatricial bands is the complete suture 
of the conjunctiva at the time of the operation 
of enucleation: When bands have formed, 
autoplasty should be performed, the flap be- 
ing taken from the neighborhood of the eye 
and not from a distant part of the body 
(heteroplasty). 



SUGGESTIVE. 



A committee appointed to investigate the 
management of the Chelsea Hospital for 
Women, London, say: 

"With regard to exploratory operations, 
we have observed that in five of eight cases 
no disease is found and no organ sufficiently 
diseased to demand removal. Circumstances 
such as these render recourse to this method 
of diagnosis unjustifiable." 



EDITORIAL NOTES. 



Adulteration of Spices and Condiments.— 

A recent bulletin of the United States De- 
partment of Agriculture gives an idea of the 
extent to which spice mixtures have gone in 
the way of sophistication: 

Allspice is adulterated with spent cloves, 
clove stems, cracker dust, ground shells or 
charcoal, mineral color, yellow corn: Red

starch, turmeric, peas, beans, corn meal, gin- 
ger, and gypsum. 

Something New in Monkeys.— 

Doctor MacGowan, a missionary physician 
in China, has for some time displayed the 
distinguishing characteristic of a modern 
Munchausen. He has told some very stiff 
and, being stimulated by the notoriety 
achieved, has now capped the climax by de- 
claring there is a race of monkeys inhabiting 
the mountain region of Chegiang, China, that 
have made extraordinary progress in the art 
of making wine. A number of these quadru- 
mana were; frightened during their migration 
from one mountain to another, and dropped 
in their flight earthen vessels, some of which 
would hold a quart; and in these were fouud 
two kinds of wine, respectively of pink and 
hues, that had been made from moun- 
tain berries. He affirms this species of our 
four-handed cousins store this liquor for win- 
ter use when the water is all frozen. 

Next ! 

Malignant Diseases in Animals.— 

It is reported that cancer has been detected 
in American brook-trout that are confined in 
ponds of New Zealand with a view of accli- 
matization. It is doubtful, however, if the 
disease is, strictly speaking, cancer, though it 
is probably malignant and closely allied to 
the salmon disease of Scotland and the trout 
fungus that affects the larger salmonoids of 
the Great Lakes. Many animals are prone to 
sarcoma, chiefly quadrupeds and quadrumana. 



Blectrlcal Execution.— 

In the case &lt;&gt;f the DegTO murderer, David 

Hampton, who m tricity 

at Sing Sing prison on January 28th, the 
autopsy showed considerable ruptures of the 
cerebral . dt of the current. 

Any attempt at resuscitation, in this ins: 
at least, would therefore have proved fruit- 
&lt;u's and Register. 

This would seem to most satisfactorily dis- 
pose of the charge that has been going the 
rounds of the lay press to the effect '•elec- 
trocution," so called, only induces suspended 
animation, ami that death results from the 
post- mortem knife. 

Chloral in Typhoid.— 

Doctor W. I,. Dunn, in the Virginia Medi- 
cal Monthly, expresses the opinion that Chloral 
hydrate shortens and renders lighter the at- 
tacks of typhoid. 

The editor of The Medical Age can cor- 
roborate the foregoing, and add moreover 
the certainty that when this drug is employed 
the danger from intestinal haemorrhage is 
greatly lessened. 

Hedicine in Upper Scandinavia.— 

In Sweden ten years of study is incumbent 
on every medical student. The demand that 
all practitioners shall be fully qualified is so 
closely observed that the practice of homoe- 
opathy is forbidden, and no globule of homoe- 
opathic medicine can enter the country 
except surreptitiously. 

A Delayed Credit.— 

In the issue of March 1 ith we had occasion 
to review " Diseases of the Ear," by Doctor 
Buck. By some inadvertence no mention 
was made of the publishers, who are Messrs. 
William Wood &amp; Co., of New York City. 



The Plague.— 

This scourge, which apparently had dis- 
appeared in China, to be replaced by cholera, 
has again broken out, and most virulently at 
Amoy. 

Taenia in a Young Infant.— 

Doctor W. M. Guice, in the Medical World, 
reports finding tapeworm in a child but 
eighteen months old.

Items and News, 



An All-Round Doctor.— 

There is an original doctor located on one of 
the islands in Puget Sound. He advertises 
in posters and placards printed on a home 
outfit, and in one of his announcements says: 

" Legs and arms sawed off while you wate 
without pane:" 

"Childbirth and tumors a specialty:" 

11 No odds asked in measles, hooping coff, 
mumps, or diarrear:" 

"Bald-head, bunions, corns, warts, cancer 
and ingrowing tow-nales treated scientific- 
ally:" « 

"Coleck, cramps, costiveness and worms 
nailed on sight:" 

"Wring-worms, pole evil, shingles, moles, 
and cross eye cured in one treatment or no 
pay." 

"P. S. Terms: Cash invariably in ad- 
vance. No cure no pay." 

"N. B. (Take Notis) No coroner never yet 
sot on the remanes of my customers, and 
enny one hiring me doan't hafto be layin up 
money to buy a gravestone. Come one come 
awl." — Stillwater Gazette. 

Failure of Haffkinism.— 

The Medical Age says: "We have before 
remarked in these columns upon the hum- 
buggery of Haffkinism, and the fact that 
converts thereto are chiefly outside the pale 
of the medical profession; also that it is pass- 
ing strange Haffkin found it necessary to 
make the long journey from the shores of 
the German Ocean to Southern Hindostan 
in the interest of science and suffering hu- 
manity when the same objects could be much 
more readily attained in Europe where the 
expectation of the recrudescence of the dis- 
ease has been fulfilled." 

Another remarkable fact is that although 
cholera is constantly endemic to certain por- 
tions of India, Haffkin carefully avoids these, 
preferring to experiment only in districts 
where the test of his theory will be far from 
crucial. — Indian Medico - Chirurgical Review. 

[Another Indian medical journal states: 
"Seventy per cent, of the men in a British 
regiment inoculated by Haffkin, to protect 
them from cholera, died from that disease." 
—Ed.] 

A Case of Malpractice.— 

Doctor Farnsworth, of Clinton, la., reports 
the following case in the Medical and Surgical 
[Reporter: The Spitz dog of a highly respect- 
able family of this city had a difficulty with 



his throat. Respiration impeded; deglutition 
difficult. The carriage was ordered out and 
"Tip" taken to a leading surgeon. The lat- 
ter diagnosed stenosis or tumor of the larynx 
in the neighborhood of the vocal cords; ex- 
amination confirmed this diagnosis. Under 
chloroform an operation was performed, but 
the dog died. A post-mortem examination 
revealed the fact that some one had slipped 
over his head a rubber band such as drug- 
gists use to tie up packages, and it had worked 
through the hair and imbedded itself in the 
skin. In any case it was the cause of the 
dog's death, and the bereaved are now query- 
ing where to fix the blame. 

Skunk Oil.— 

An Iowa correspondent of an exchange 
gives the following information concerning 
the origin of skunk oil: "Skunk oil is com- 
monly sold in the drug stores around us as a 
remedy for rheumatism. Skunks hybernate 
during the winter, never appearing above 
ground excepting on very fine days. Before 
retiring underground, they become well loaded 
with fat. When killed by drowning them — 
filling up their holes with water — they are dug 
out without producing any offensive odor. 
The 'stink-bag' is removed, the skin secured, 
and then the fat taken out and treated just 
as in making lard. The preparation of skunk 
oil is a profitable industry during the winter 
months. A German family living at Ester- 
ville, Iowa, do a considerable business in its 
preparation every year." — Scientific American. 

Large Oysters. — 

Pliny mentions that according to the his- 
torians of Alexander's expedition, oysters a 
foot in diameter were found in the Indian 
seas; and Sir James E. Tennent was unex- 
pectedly enabled to corroborate the correct- 
ness of the statement, for at Kottiar, near 
Trincomalee (Ceylon), enormous specimens 
of edible oysters were found. One measured 
more than eleven inches in length by half as 
many in width. But this extraordinary meas- 
urement is beaten by the oysters of Port Lin- 
coln in South Australia; they are as large as 
a dinner plate and of much the same shape, 
sometimes more than a foot across the shell, 
and the oyster fits his habitation so well that 
he does not leave much margin. — Exchange. 

Hal de Her.— 

A correspondent sends the following story, 
for the truth of which he vouches, concerning 
a man and woman who were horribly sea-sick 
crossing the English Channel. The stew- 
ardess found them sitting together on the 
deck, the woman leaning back with closed

shoulder. M Your husband 

• than jroa do," said the stewardess, 

sympathetically. Tin- sick woman opened 
her eyes and glanced at her fellow sufferer 
with a sort of despairing indifference. Then 
she gasped as she closed her eyes wearily 
"He's not my husband; I'm sure 1 
don't know who he is." — Sanitarian. 

Therapeutic fallacies.— 

A writer in the American Journal of /' 
points out the fallacy of the oft-rep 
ment that lithic urate Is more soluble 
than any of the urate salts, and therefore 
lithia water is suitable to gouty patients and 
others who suffer from a superabundance of 
lithic acid; also the erroneous assumption 
that the exhibiting of chlorate of potash in 
blood-poisoning wid oxydize and destroy the 
poison in the blood. The fact is, as any 
chemist knows, that in an alkaline solution 
like the blood, chlorate of potash is practi- 
cally stable and consequently inert. 

Castration for Enlarged Prostate.— 

Doctor W. T. Belfield, of Chicago, warns 
against this operation, because the analogy 
between uterine myoma and prostatic enlarge- 
ment omits the element in the latter of inflam- 
mation which clinically plays so important a 
part; and castration will not produce atrophy 
of this gland if it is interstitially hypertrophied 
from inflammation. Then, again, he says, in 
too many of these cases the cystitis is due to 
vesical calculi, cancer, papilloma, and tuber- 
culosis, in which the enlarged prostate is but 
a symptom. 

Competition in Medicine. — 

Physicians in the future must expect hard 
times if the new doctors are to furnish any 
competition. It is estimated that there are 
nearly twenty-five thousand medical students 
at the present time. How are eight thousand 
physicians a year to be absorbed in the 
ranks of successful practitioners? Yet new 
medical colleges continue to be called for 
by philanthropic physicians anxious to do 
something for posterity. Posterity would 
often be better for being let alone. — J } /iysician 
and Surgeon. 

Hark This!— 

Surgery is vastly overdone of late; . . . 
the modern shifting notions on pathology are 
largely responsible for the present state of 
things; the ever-haunting phantom of infec- 
tion from simple lesions has led to the con- 
clusion that local and radical measures are 
called for in the treatment of conditions 



which in the usual order are remediable 
through simple means with the aid of systemic 
therapy. — Times and Register. 

Anxious.— 

A letter was received by the principal of 

the school the other day. It is from an 

anxious parent whose daughter is a member 
of the class in physiology and is as follows: 

" 1 tear Mis : I don't want you to learn 

my daughter any more about her insides. It 
ain't decent and it turns her against her 
kittles. Respectfully, ." 

'♦Track of the Wandering Jew." — 

Cholera has* appeared with considerable 
virulence in Southern Europe toward the 
Asiatic border. At Constantinople many 
with nearly fifty per cent, of deaths, 
are reported. Even worse conditions are 
reported from China, particularly at the seat 
of war. 

The Buffalo Medical and Surgical Journal.— 

Our esteemed contemporary will be fifty 
years old in a few weeks, and its editor pro- 
poses to signalize its semi-centennial by in- 
creasing its reading pages and making other 
improvements that will keep it abreast of the 
progress of the period. 

Suggestive Employment.— 

The advertising pages of an exchange 
contain the following: 

11 A translation of the diploma of Med- 
ical College will be forwarded on receipt of a 
two cent postage stamp by Dr. ." 

Unmistakably True.— 

Many medical-journal articles of real value 
are so offensively scientific and correct and 
so full of technicalities and pedantic imperti- 
nences that it is a punishment to read them. 
— American Lancet. 

A Good Collector.— 

A midwife in western North Carolina ii 
said to have confiscated a new-born bal 
cause her fee was not paid. She was fright- 
ened into returning it. — Medical Fortnightly. 

Death-Rate in the French Army.— 

This is said to be 107 yearly to every ten 
thousand nun. And during the Franco-Ger- 
man war the French loss from smallpox was 
23,500. 

A Definition of Influenza.— 

A clergyman defines la grippe as " A 'cold' 
possessed of the devil."

Medical Gynaecology. By Alexander J. C. Skene. 
Cloth; 8vo; pp. 529. D. Appleton &amp; Co., New 
York. 

The value of this book is sufficiently evi- 
denced by the name of the author. It is 
written perhaps more in the interests of the 
general practitioner than of the specialist, and 
xleals more particularly with the medical side 
iof gynaecology, wherein it differs from the 
imajority of works. Part I deals with the 
differentiation of sex, development and growth 
during early life, etc., incidentally discussing 
leredity, environment, care of children, men- 
tal and physical education, culture and hy- 
giene. Part II treats of the characteristics 
i )f sex, and follows up all the functional and 
. &gt;rganic diseases common to the period of 
.ctive functional life. Part III discusses the 
menopause, or transition from functional life 
- old age, along with the diseases of the 
itter period. 

( This work fills a niche in medical literature 
itherto unoccupied, and it cannot but be of 
alue to all classes of medical men. We 
ordially recommend it, particularly for its 
lain, practical, hard-headed yet simple teach- 
lgs. 



he Medical Annual and Practitioners' Index. 
Cloth; i2mo; pp. 751. Price, -js. bd. John 
Wright &amp; Co., Stone Bridge, Bristol, England. 

This the thirteenth yearly issue of this 
lblication is especially interesting. It is a 



very complete compendium of the advance of 
medical science during the year 1894, by a 
full corps of distinguished authors, among 
whom we note Gilbert Burling, Fancourt 
Barnes, William Elam, J. H. Fenwick, John 
Fitzgerald, Colcott Fox, Dundas Grant, Allan 
McLane Hamilton, VV. Arburton Lane, Gre- 
ville Macdonald, Hector Mackenzie, Joseph 
Priestly, Ramsay Smith, and Blair Stewart. 
Notably there is a very complete history of 
the antitoxin treatment of diphtheria, by 
Armand Ruffer; likewise a comprehensive 
resume of the advance in surgical instruments 
and appliances. 

It is impossible to give this book the re- 
view it deserves, since its scope is so large; 
yet it is of the utmost value to the practi- 
tioner in affording him at a glance informa- 
tion which otherwise could be obtained only 
through the perusal of many volumes and 
periodicals. 



Twentieth -Century Practice of Medicine. 
Edited by Thomas L. Stedman. Cloth; 8vo; 
pp. 739. Price, $5.00. William Wood &amp; Co., 
New York. 

The second volume opens with a treatise 
upon "Addison's Disease and other Diseases 
of the Adrenal Bodies," by Sir Dyce Duck- 
worth. "Diabetes Mellitus" is by Carl von 
Norden; "Rheumatism," by T.J. Maclagan; 
"Gout," by Henry M. Lyman; "Arthritis 
Deformans," by Archibald G. Garrod; "Dis- 
eases of the Muscles," by Dujardin-Beaumetz; 
"Obesity," by M. J. Oertel. 

We cannot commend too highly this vol- 
ume, which also must be considered as evi- 
dence of the value of the volume to follow. 
All the authors of Volume II are noted 
specialists, only one of whom, however (Doc- 
tor Lyman), is a resident of the United States. 
They represent the special talent of Great 
Britain, France, Frankfort-on-the-Main, and 
Munich. 



General Medicinal Technology. By Edward 
Curtis, A M, M.D. Cloth; 32mo; pp. 235. Price 
$1.00. William Wood &amp; Co., New York. 

This little manual has been so well received 
as to require a third edition. It deals with 
topics that find scant treatment in the usual 
text-books of the materia medica, and can- 
not fail to be of value to every practitioner. 



Diseases of the Ear. By Doctor A. Buck. 

This work was reviewed in The Medical Age 
for March nth last, but by some unfortunate con- 
tretemps the name of the publishers, Messrs. Wm. 
Wood &amp; Co., of New York, was omitted.

The rapid loss of body-weight 
attending the treatment of myzcedema with 
thyroid extract very naturally ed the 

applicability of the same method of treatment 

to that bite noire oi middle-aged men and the 
fair - AJrea&lt; rs Leich- 

tenstern and Wendelstadt, of the Augusta 

. have observed a manifest 
diminution &lt;&gt;f embonpoint in twenty-two of 
y-five obese subjects after a course of 
treatment with fresh sheep's-thyroid. The 
good effects observed are ascribed to more 
active combustion of the accumulated fat, 
rather than to the diuresis which is a marked 
feature of the initial stage of the treatment. 
It is said that the process is more rapid 
during the early part of the cure, the loss of 
weight diminishing gradually. The actual 
wasting observed varied in the different cases 
from two to ten pounds during the first week, 
and from two to seventeen pounds after sev- 
eral weeks' treatment. MM. Charrin and 
Roger have succeeded in procuring notable 
emaciation in animals subjected to subcuta- 
neous iujections of thyroid-juice in daily dose 
of from seven to ten grains. In Professor 
Bouchard's wards, M. Charrin gave an aver- 
age of fifteen grains daily of thyroid-juice, 
both subcutaneously and by the stomach, to 
a woman affected with general adiposis with 
more pronounced accumulation of fat at the 
junction of the limbs with the trunk. In 
three months her body-weight fell from 295 
to 249 pounds. The treatment was after- 
wards continued at intervals. During the 
periods of suspension of the treatment the 
weight remained stationary, but fell at the 
rate of one and a-half to five ounces per day 
when the extract was again administered. A 
maximum of emaciation appeared, however, 
to be reached in time. Analogous, although 
less marked, results were obtained in a second 
patient, whilst a third remained unaffected; a 
like disappointment was noted in several other 
instances. M. Charrin ascribes the incon- 
stancy of results to the different natures of 
the obesity, to insufficiency of treatment, and 
in certain instances to the bad quality of the 
substance employed. It is only right to add 
that the patients experimented on were one 
and all women, and all free from symptoms 
of myxcedema. — J he Lancet (London).

medical men; but does it not seem that 
repeated failures would teach that hap- 
hazard guesswork is neither scientific or 
productive of good ? There is quite a differ- 
ence between jumping at conclusions and 
establishing a fact. 

Neither is the general practitioner to un- 
dertake to establish facts by subjecting hi 
patients to senseless experiments with nei 
and untried remedies, even though the latter 
are highly praised. Experiments and discov- 
eries of new cures (sic) and new methods

Foreign Bodies in Anus. — A point frequentlj 
overlooked is the effect of foreign bodies ii 
the anus, in relation to pruritus, fissure, erosioi 
and intertrigo. It is well known that anil 
parasites lead to irritation and finally 
erosion, and that the pruritus thus caused 
made use of to establish a diagnosis, but ver 
seldom is the cause of intolerable symptom! 
looked for in the presence of too long hail 
about the anus. In hard and frequent &lt; 
ations, the lower part of the rectum is pusht 
out and the anal ring remains open for a fc 
seconds. These long hairs are pressed again*

the mucous membrane and remain imbedded 
in the folds. The sphincter, regaining shortly 
its normal position, presses and pulls the 
hairs, and the muco-rectal irritation gives 
rise to the sensation of tenesmus. The hairs 
become incarcerated, friction leads to in- 
creased irritation, and prolonged irritation to 
intertrigo and erosion. 

A farmer complained a long time of itch- 
ing and soreness in the anus. Inspection 
revealed very long hairs, a few of which had 
become incarcerated; on their complete re- 
moval and a few applications of carbolized 
vaselin, the sore sensation and tenesmus 
«eased. 

Often too little attention is paid to the in- 
digestible portions of food, such as the shell 
of sweet corn, the seeds of grapes, berries, 
etc., which are easily caught in the anus and 
act as foreign bodies, particularly when in- 
carcerated in the folds of the anal ring. They 
thus become the cause of paraproctitis and 
rectal fistula. In one case, apparent para- 
proctitis was found to result from a splinter 
?f wood— the result of chewing toothpicks; 
mother from a fish-bone in same locality. A 
:ase of supposed haemorrhoids proved to be 
i fissure in the direction of the perineum in 
vhich was imbedded the seed of an orange. 
V suffering infant owed its troubles to tomato- 
eeds, the result of feeding upon this fruit 
he day before. 

By examining the rectum, especially in 
hildren, many cases of troublesome tenesmus 
nil be found to depend on such simple causes 
■ s the above. — Doctor Fest, in The P vac- 
ationer. 



Belladonna. — Belladonna is frequently of 

se in the diseases of children, and particu- 

irly valuable in disorders of the respiratory 

pparatus accompanied by excessive secre- 

on or by spasmodic action, from coryza with 

:peated sneezing to spasmodic bronchitis 

id whooping-cough. In coryza with abund- 

lt discharge and difficulty of respiration on 

:count of obstruction of the nasal fossae, 

is drug is especially advantageous to pro- 

ote dryness of the pituitary membrane. 

mple laryngitis due to cold, laryngismus 

ridulus, essential or symptomatic spasm of 

e glottis, are also favorably influenced. In 

• great many cases Belladonna produces 

bnifest relief, acting both upon the laryn- 

. al secretions and the nervous element 

Mich causes the spasm. Tracheo bronchitis 

id spasmodic bronchitis, whether dependent 

c not upon la grippe, are equally ameliorated 

I its employment. As much may be said in 

tyor of its use in constitutional or symp- 

tnatic asthma, the asthma-like attacks of 



tracheo-bronchial adenopathy or of emphy- 
sema, and in paroxysms of dyspnoea. Al- 
though so beneficial in spasmodic affections 
of the upper respiratory passages, its use is 
to be deprecated in pulmonary maladies ac- 
companied by prostration and tendency to 
collapse, as pneumonia, broncho-pneumonia, 
etc. Above all it is in whooping-cough that 
this remedy has been employed the most fre- 
quently and extensively. Its sedative and 
antispasmodic properties particularly dis- 
tinguish it as suitable for use in a disease 
in which the spasmodic element overshadows 
all other manifestations; it is, therefore, uni- 
versally employed in the spasmodic stage of 
pertussis. In order to obtain its beneficial 
effects, however, it should be pushed until it 
begins to produce its constitutional manifes- 
tations. Smaller doses do not succeed in 
allaying the spasmodic cough. — Medical Bul- 
letin. 



Cactus Grandiflorus. — The literature of this 
drug, though extensive, is somewhat vague, 
too many properties being ascribed to it, 
without authoritative evidence of a pharma- 
cological or carefully carried-out therapeu- 
tical kind. Its chemistry is practically un- 
known, and no one as yet has been able to 
determine either a contained alkaloid or 
glucoside — only a series of resins. These 
resins, to be sure, contract the blood-vessels 
of frogs, but such is not a digitalis contrac- 
tion and is due, I believe, to simple acidity: 
on the heart they have little or no effect, 
comparisons being made with digitalis on the 
same animal. There is no proof that Cactus 
shortens diastole, nor in fact that it has any

Horse Nettle {Solatium Carolinense). — The 
common Horse Nettle has been recently 
brought forward as an antispasmodic of value 
in convulsive affections such as chorea, puer- 
peral eclampsia, etc , and especially in epi- 
lepsy. Many cases that have resisted all 
other remedies have been either cured or 
greatly benefited, we are told. Favorable 
results of the action of the drug have already 
appeared in several of the medical journals. 
During the past five months this new candi- 
date for consideration has been given trial in 
eleven cases in the wards of the Alabama In- 
sane Hospital, and the results are not en- 
couraging. The drug seemed well borne in 
every instance, and there were no compli- 
cations or unfavorable symptoms save that 
in four cases an increase in the convulsions 
was noted. Scarcely any line of treatment 
heretofore employed has given such uniformly 
unfavorable results as the Horse Nettle. It 
is possible that in the treatment of a less un- 
favorable class of patients the results might 
prove more encouraging. — Abstract of paper

Chloral Hydrate. — If it were not for the 
unpleasant taste of this agent, there would 
be no need for many of the long list of 
hypnotics. During twenty years it has held 
its own, and deserves the position it occupies 
as a nerve sedative and sudorific. It is the 
remedy par excellence for wakefulness with 
excitability, exaggerated mental activity. It 
is especially desirable for children, but should 
be given in small doses and begun two or 
three hours before sleep is desired. It will 
prevent spasm in the young, or overcome a 
sharp convulsion, especially if of reflex origin, 
with as great certainty as any other known 
agent. It has powerful relaxing effects in 
large doses and may thus be used to relieve 



rigidity of the OS a ten; and with this condi- 
tion there is often that nervoi; 1 neral

Cannabis Indica. — Cannabis Indica is

^con, and, although not so lasting in its

Glaucoma and Scopolamine. — Scopolamine, 
introduced to the ophthalmic profession by 
Raehlmann, was said by him to be free from 
one of the objections to which other mydri- 
atics are open, namely, a tendency to give 
rise to glaucoma. Walter now shows that 
Scopolamine deserves no especial distinction 
in this respect; in two cases its use caused 
prompt and severe attacks of glaucoma. The 
chief advantage now left to be claimed for it 
depends upon the alleged fact that while 
much more prompt than atropine, its effects 
pass off much more quickly — a matter of 
considerable importance when it is used in 
tests of the refraction. — Annals d'Oculistiaue. 



Rectal Feeding. — This may be carried on 
by a mixture of two eggs, twenty grains pep-

the entrance of the fluid into the intestines, 
it is well to put the patient with the hips

Medical Progress. 



On Total Extirpation of the Patella. 
—In the Revue Mddicale de la Suisse Romande, 
)octor E Kummer advocates the following: 

Total extirpation of the patella can be per- 
ormed without impairing the patient's gait 
r markedly interfering with movements of 
he knee-joint: 

The operation is indicated in cases of tuber- 
ular osteitis of the patella, provided the 
rticulation remains yet intact: 

Extirpation can actually prevent the de- 
elopment of articular lesions and thus save 
ie knee joint, provided the operation is re- 
nted to sufficiently early: 

In cases of tubercular osteitis of the knee- 
ip, total removal of the bone offers better 
lances in regard to recovery than scraping 
jt the morbid foci. 

Doctor Kummer adduces an illustrative case 
-a girl of twenty-five, with primary tubercu- 

sis of the right patella, but with a per- 
Jctly intact knee-joint — in which he made 
xision of the bone, with excellent results. 

hen shown to the Societe Medicale de 
teneve about two months after the opera- 
pn, the patient was able to extend her right 

wer limb as under normal conditions; would 
heel with perfect freedom, and without any 
j.in or discomfort; could walk four or five 
jjturs daily without lameness or fatigue, or 
in up and down staircases with ease, etc. 
] short, the only inconvenience caused by 
e absence of the knee-cap consisted in a 
r atively weakened extension of the corre- 
sonding limb. 

A similarly successful case of total removal 
c the patella is reported by Professor Kauf- 
rmn, in Correspondenz Blatt fur Schweizer 
jrzte. The patient, a married lady of thirty- 
lee, was suffering from fungoid osteitis of 
(t|; left knee-cap, of eight years' standing. 
4 month after the operation she, being 
f;?htened by a fire next door, tore off all 
dissings and ran out of her house, having 
ssftly descended a staircase. Since then 

• knee-joint has been perfectly movable 
a'i her gait normal. 

J Doctor Kummer mentions further two 
C;|es of primary tubercular osteitis of the 
pella in boys, in which the whole of the 
b&lt;ie was removed by Professor Th. Kocher, 
o Berne. 

\n interesting case of total excision of the 
p'ella for acute necrosis has also been pub- 
hied in the Lancet (London), by Mr. Page, 
ojNewcastle-on-Tyne. The patient recov- 

t\d with a perfectly useful limb. — Provincial 

kdical Journal. 



Aspermatism. — Doctor Henry C. Sims, of 
Philadelphia, recently published a case of 
aspermatism which is of interest as constitut- 
ing a rare variety of relative impotence, and 
from the sociological element involved. The 
patient was a strong, healthy Irishman, twenty- 
seven years of age, and a blacksmith by 
occupation. His genital organs are normally 
developed, testicles rather above the average 
in size. Erectile power is normal, and libido 
sexualis present but rather vague. When under 
the influence of sexual excitement he experi- 
ences no difficulty in intromissio penis, but has 
no orgasm. There is no discharge of seminal 
or other fluid before, during or after the act, 
although with the ensuing flaccidity comes a 
feeling of -some satisfaction. He has very 
rarely lascivious dreams, and never pollu- 
tions. The urethra admits a full-sized sound, 
and shows a normal sensibility at the pars 
prostatica. There has never been any urinary 
difficulty, nor any deposit in the urine after 
coitus. As far as could be ascertained, the 
prostate and seminal vesicles are normal. 
Owing to the lack of pathological change, 
history of disease, or excessive venery, the 
case has been classed provisionally among 
those of psychical aspermatism, because it 
might perhaps be due to want of excitability 
of the reflex centre of ejaculation. All con- 
ditions for the perfect performance of fruit- 
ful connection are present, except seminal 
fluid. 

The case differs somewhat from others of 
the class, as there is not now, nor has there ever 
been, any discharge from the urethra, even in 
the form of pollutions, and hence Doctor 
Sims considers it a case in which there is no 
secretion of spermatic fluid and consequently 
the sexual passion is necessarily not perfectly 
developed; or, more correctly, there is a 
partial delay of development of sexual pas- 
sion, and, as a result, no secretion of semen. 
He is also inclined to believe that under the 
regular sexual hygiene of married life the 
testicles would very probably assume their 
proper physiological function. 

In regard to the propriety of marriage in 
cases in which there exists permanent steril- 
ity, there should be no hesitation in advising 
against it. The man who is unable to obey 
the command, "Be fruitful and multiply," 
has no right to disappoint the hopes and im- 
peril the happiness, and perhaps the health. 
of a woman. — Virginia Medical Monthly. 



The Anal Reflex. — In healthy man, a 
gentle touching of the skin and mucous 
membrane of the anal region gives rise to an 
immediate reflex contraction of the anal

sphin "anal reflex"). When pi 

ped form, the reflei is 
npanied by a drawing-in (or 

.uon) of the anal orifice. 

The anal phenomenon belongs to the 

int musculo- cutaneous reflexes Ina nor- 
mal human being. 

The anatomical centre presiding over the 
phenomenon appears to be situated in the 

lower portion of the lumbar enlargement of 
the spinal cord, since, as experiments on dogs 
have shown, a high division of the spinal 
cord is followed by an increase in the reflex; 
while, on the other hand, the phenomenon 
disappears as soon as the cord has been 
divided at the level of the third sacral nerve 
root, or when both of the fourth posterior 
sacral roots have been destroyed. 

A diminution or a total loss of the anal 
reflex may be observed in cases of locomotor 
ataxia, multiple neuritis, neuritis of the sciatic 
nerve, and myelitis involving the lower por- 
tion of the lumbar enlargement of the spinal 
cord. 

An exaggeration of the anal reflex may be 
met with in cases of high transversal lesion of 
the spinal cord, and in neurotic patients pre- 
senting increase in musculo-cutaneous re- 
flexes in general. 

The condition of the anal reflex, side by 
side with other symptoms, may prove a use- 
ful adjuvant diagnostic sign in cases of dif- 
ferentiation between organic and functional 
diseases of the nerve system, and in cases of 
determining the localization of the morbid 
process in this or that division of the nerve 
system. — Rossolimo, in Vratch. 



Habitual Headaches. — Habitual head- 
ache very frequently is of nasal origin. Even 
in neurasthenia and hysteria, headache may 
be only due to some local nasal affection, and 
not be a single symptom of the total symp- 
tom-complex. Grave diseases of the nasal 
cavities and their appendages may exist for a 
long time without the patient noticing them, 
while his headache is terrific, and only by 
the nasal symptoms becoming more distinct 
is the attention of the physician called to the 
true source. Neurasthenics are more easily 
affected than healthy subjects by these nasal 
irritations; often their headache is of local 
origin, and they will be frequently relieved 
by appropriate local treatment. Most pa- 
tients with swelling of the mucous membrane 
of the turbinated bones suffer from more or 
less headache, and hence, where no known 
cause can be discovered in a case of head- 
ache, I advise examination of the nose, in 
hysterics and neurasthenics as well. Polypi 



ain originates at tr 

root of the nose, and radiates into the eye &lt; 
the temple, or there is a constant dull pre! 
ure over the root of the nose, whit h often 
lated with dull headache. Especially!

mucous membrane of the turbinated bone

Hystero-Epileisv i rom Worms, — A pea

year. Now they occurred several tim

two-and-a-half minutes, mostly recurring su 
cessively twice or thrice, with intervals var

ng from five to ten minutes; they consisted 
n exceedingly violent clonic convulsions ac- 
companied by loss of consciousness, insensi- 
bility of the pupil, trismus, etc., being ushered 
n by globus hystericus or epigastric pain, 
jometimes by vomiting, and invariably shortly 
ifter a meal. After the attacks he remained 
n a drowsy state for one or two hours, com- 
ng round but very slowly and looking ex- 
;remely weak. The administration of potas- 
sium bromide in increasing daily doses of 
:rom twenty to eighty grains, during a month, 
md a subsequent course of laxatives, did not 
produce the slightest effect on either the fre- 
quency or the severity of the fits. Ultimately, 
laving elicited the fact that the lad had 
/oided "a worm" five years previously, I 
ried santonin in one-grain doses three times 
laily, for three days, with the result that 
even ascarides were expelled, after which all 
tpileptic symptoms vanished as if by magic, 
.nd never again recurred. — Doctor S. N. 
Coneff, in Meditzinskaia Beseda. 



I Action of the Liver on Poisons. — The 
ver modifies the toxic effects of several 
oisons, notably nicotine, atropine, quinine, 
nd strychnine; also certain putrid and in- 
istinal poisons, peptones, and some salts, 
.articularly ammoniacal salts. On the other 
and, the liver exercises no influence over 
ther substances, such as digitalin, potash 
id soda salts, glycerin, etc. Like the kid- 
ey, it possesses an elective action. To con- 
ol these results it is necessary that the 
)ison should be absorbed very slowly. In 
ie case of a diseased liver (cirrhosis, fatty 
^generation, etc.), in which the parenchyma 
) longer contains glycogen, the organ does 
)t act on poisons, but it suffices to adminis- 
r substance capable of forming glycogen to 
Ie the hepatic gland again competent to 
unsform poisons. The action of the healthy 
1-er is continually exerted against toxic sub- 
: inces in the system, and is still more marked 
i those infectious diseases in which decided 
txic effects are produced. Some clinical 
jipts go to prove that many morbid symp- 
tns are due to insufficiency of the liver in 
r^ard to poisons. — Doctor Roger, in Le 
j -ogres Medical. 



Fibroids and Pregnancy. — Hofmeier 
ciies that fibroid disease of the uterus has 
JjiT direct influence in causing sterility. 
S v itistics do not show that subserous myoma 
P'disposes to sterility. Nor can it be shown 
t,.t fibroids promote fertility. These tumors 
sdom begin to appear till late in sexual life, 



so that if the patient is barren or a multipara, 
the causes of sterility or fecundity must have 
influenced her long before. The alleged fre- 
quency of this disease in elderly virgins is 
based on fallacy, since it is the affection which 
most readily drives a spinster to the gynae- 
cologist, whilst middle-aged married women 
trouble themselves less about small and slow- 
growing abdominal swellings. Women with 
fibroids who marry late in sexual life are 
fairly fertile. Fibroids by no means strongly 
predispose to abortion, for this accident hap- 
pens only when the uterine cavity is rendered 
unfit to bear through the size and relations 
of the tumor; nor does fibroid greatly inter- 
fere with the uterine contractions during 
labor. The best time for hysterectomy is 
not immediately after delivery, but a few 
weeks or months later. — British Medical 

Journal.

Superfcetation. — A woman, thirty years 
of age, multipara, ceased menstruating May 
10th; on August 4th profuse haemorrhage 
came on, which continued, more or less, until 
November 2d, when she miscarried, with not 
more than four uterine contractions, a female 
infant, no haemorrhage following. The pla- 
centa was complete, bloodless, pale, and 
granulated. At the moment of delivery 
something like a cotyledon detached from 
the placenta could be felt in the vagina, 
which, when opened, revealed a small amount 
of liquid and an embryo of scarcely three 
months, the different constituent parts of 
which were quite evident but in a condition 
of degeneration. There was an adherent 
placenta in the same condition. The child 
of six months lived some hours. 

This coincidence of two germs — the one 
dead, which Nature endeavored to expel by 
means of the haemorrhages, the other living, 
notwithstanding the serious functional dis- 
turbance of the uterus — is quite rare. — M. 
Dufour, in La Me'decine Moderne. 



A New Symptom of Cancer. — G. Bogdan 
relates the case of a woman, aged forty- eight, 
who through a long period of latency suffered 
from cancer of the stomach. Each cheek 
presented a patch of wine-red discoloration 
formed by the dilatation of the superficial 
venules, and that showed out sharply against 
the pale yellow of the surrounding skin. On 
the strength of this symptom alone, Bogdan 
was able to make a diagnosis of probable 
cancer at a time when there was no other 
sign of that affection. He regards such 
superficial varicosities on the cheeks as a

. invariably causes death after a maxi 
mum lapse of two, three, or four hours. This 
ablation immediately causes intense shock, 
with phenomena of stupefaction and of gen- 
eral collapse, especially of the heart. Section 
of the spinal cord in advance, or the exhibi- 
tion of atropine, notably retards these symp- 
toms, and at the same time diminishes their 
intensity. The theory of auto-intoxication 
appears less in accord with these facts than 
does that of a violent neurolytic action, thus 
apparently confirming the recent opinion of 
Fusari that the supra-renal glands are nerv-

night, death taking place upon the third day. 
The autopsy revealed atrophic cirrhosis of 
the liver, and thickened and dilated veins 
of the mucous membrane of the oesophagus 
toward its lower third. Fatality was due to 
haemorrhage from the varicose veins of the 
oesophagus; the accumulation and stagnation 
of blood in these vessels was the consequence 
of the cirrhosis of the liver. The case is of 
interest on account of its rarity, and also the 
latent course of the cirrhosis. — La Medccine

ERNUMERART Testes — In making ex-

Army, I found him with four testicles. Three 
were on the left side of the scrotum, and one 
on the right, all apparently perfect, yielding 
the peculiar pain incident to pressure. Three 
were large and well developed, and one, situ- 
ated high up in the scrotum, was small. 

There appeared to be but two spermatic 
cords, though the two large testicles in the 
left side seemed connected by a subsidiary 
spermatic cord, which I suppose would indi- 
cate that one was supplied from the other. —

Etiology of Chills. — Chills differ very 
much, but may be divided into two main 
groups: Those from sudden shock to the

fever is absent. In the second group there! 
is always fever. The nervous chill is that 
met with in gallstone colic or in the passage 
of a catheter. This initial chill is without 
fever, but subsequently, of course, there may 
be chills with fever due to infection. The 
disease most often associated with chills is 
malarial fever, and here the chill is of a 
characteristic kind, so that the name "chills 
and fever" is synonymous with malaria.—

HEDICAL HISTORY, AND ITS IMPORTANCE 

BY P. C. REMONDINO, M.D. 

It is pleasing to note the awakened interest 
that pervades the body medical in regard to 
the importance of the study of the history of 
bur science. The Annals of Anatomy, of 
Brooklyn, some years ago published a series 
of biographical sketches of the medical lead- 
ers of the revival period; and the Brooklyn 
■Medical Journal has since given us a fine 
series of portraits of the great European 
[nasters in medicine of the seventeenth and 
eighteenth centuries. The Medical Age is 
low publishing the interesting course of lec- 
ures on the History of Medicine delivered 
n the Medical Department of the University 
&gt;f Buffalo by Professor Roswell Park; and 
1 [he editor of the Tri-State Medical Journal 
now and then favors his readers with some 
fell selected excerpts illustrative of the his- 
ory of medicine and of medical bibliography. 

I was well pleased to see, published in 
late number of the Ohio Medical Journal, 

nother departure in the same line, in the 

lape of a condensation of a lecture deliv- 

r ed by Professor James T. Whittaker, of 

incinnati, on the history of tuberculosis — 

•though I should have preferred the lec- 

lre in full. That which Professor Whittaker 

iiys regarding the subject of tuberculosis, 

imely, that "you may obtain no real famil- 

rity with a disease without some knowledge 

its history," is equally applicable to all 

seases. There is too much unconcern 

nong moderns regarding the labors of 

rmer generations of medical men and the 

teeases with which they had to contend. 

As Professor Pepper very truly observes, 

*e last generation has been one of wonder- 

II progress in medicine, but we must not 



overlook the fact that much of that progress 
has not yet crystallized into permanent form, 
and that much of what we have accepted as 
established we will in the end have to relin- 
quish as impracticable; the tests of time, ex- 
perience and observation are yet to do their 
perfect work. In medicine we should be 
optimistic with our patients, but most de- 
cidedly conservative and skeptical concern- 
ing the adoption of untried or insufficiently 
tested means. He who allows himself to be 
seduced into adopting every new idea or 
theory, will in the end become a more con- 
firmed and hopeless medical pessimist than 
he who calmly waits for results before be- 
coming too enthusiastic. 

Many of our so-called advancements are 
merely a rehabilitation of ideas that were 
long ago discarded, but now appear as new 
because set off by a modern environment. 
Even during the Roman epoch of medicine, 
in the first centuries of our present era, there 
arose a sect which bore the same relation to 
the Broussaisism of that period that homoe- 
opathy has borne to that of our own century. 
A careful study of the history of our art and 
science would, by maintaining a better equi- 
librium, prevent much of this running to ex- 
tremes as well as the necessity of a restraining 
remedy. 

There is no way in which we may gain so 
thorough a knowledge of a disease as by 
studying its history across the centuries. 
Studying a disease in a text-book is a dry 
and often a misleading occupation; but the 
history of the same disease, with its varied 
aspects and modifications as influenced by 
varying civilizations, and the methods em- 
ployed to combat its ravages or to hold it in 
abeyance, invests the subject with an interest 
that it never before seemed to possess. 
Medicine has as interesting a history as has 
war, architecture, painting, or music. If we 
find it a dry and uninteresting study, the

poor teachers, and act as wet blankets to the* 
ardor tfa it each student should carry into his 
rk. Such men could greatly improve 
then :ul increase their sphere of use- 

fulness, and from being dreaded bores be- 
come most interesting and instructive lec- 
turers, simply by studying the history of 
their particular branch of medicine. The 
red interest on the part of the student is 
often awakened by the narration of clinical 
cases in connection with the description of 
the disease. This was the charm of many of 
the works on medicine of the earlier quarter 
of the present century. It was this that 
made Watson's Practice, Graves's Clinical 
Medicine, and Trousseau's Clinical Medicine 
so classical, so readable, and so instructive. 
These works give a better and more com- 
prehensive idea of the subject treated; the 
student not only obtains a better view of a 
disease in its entirety, but is better enabled 
to trace its ramifications as well as its rela- 
tions to other conditions. Watson's work 
has continued to be a highly recommended 
class-book, regardless of the changing views 

to the treatment of diseases — on account 
of its great value as an entertaining educator. 
It has often been said that Watson lent a 
touch of romance to medical subjects which 
would lead one unweariedly and uncon- 
sciously from page to page, whilst many 
other works on the same subject would from 
their want of objectiveness fail to fix the 
attention. 

Why have so many Americans considered 
a final European course necessarily supple- 
mental to their already acquired American 
medical education? Is it not because they 
feel the need of a philosophical knowledge 
of the history of our science? Dunglison's

These about complete the list of the \ 
of American historians of medicine; and the 
reason why they are so little known, read or 
studied is to be found in the fact that but 
little used to be said by any of our teachers 
that would call our attention to the existence, 
much less to the importance, of this branch 
of study, and to its broadening scope when 
applied to the study of diseases in particul; 
or of medicine in general. 

In Europe there also existed a more conjj 
plete as well as a better detailed system of 
clinical instruction; men there " walked th&lt; 
hospitals;" whilst the student in Philadi 
phia, Boston or Xew York turned over f&lt;

student abroad was fitted for special coui 
of instruction specially devoted to this brand 
of study, which he could further supplement 
and extend by consulting a most complet 
and comprehensive literature — a literatur 
rendered additionally interesting by 1( 
traditions and the respect with which 
memory of noted medical men is held u 
France, not only by the profession but I 
laity. 

The study of the history of medicine ex

branches of philosophical science. Medi- 
cine is nowhere so isolated as in the United 
States. This condition is not so marked as 
it was twenty years ago, but it still exists. 
The American Public Health Association, 
the New York Medico-Legal Society and its 
journal, and other kindred associations, have 
done much in late years to bring us more 
closely together and make us acquainted with 
each other; but there is not as yet that mu- 
tual understanding and retroactive reliance 
and support that should exist between the 
[learned professions and the philosophically 
trained of the nation. This is evident from 
[the little influence which the body medical 
bxerts in governmental matters. Were there 
a better and a more diffused knowledge of 
the history of medicine, and of the necessary 
lind unavoidable influence that this art has at 
[ill times exerted on social development and 
National affairs, its real relations to govern- 
ment would be better recognized and un- 
derstood as well as appreciated. Were the 
profession to make more of this study, it 
•yould encourage its pursuit among other 
Philosophical bodies, who would then recog- 
ize a familiarity with its main details as being 
n important mental accomplishment, or at 
tie least as being contributory to a thorough 
cquaintaace with general history, as nothing 
b explains the social and mental development 
f an epoch as its condition in relation to 
ledicine. 

Of late, the awakening to our neglect of 

lis branch of the history of philosophy has 

.imulated some action in the proper direc- 

on, and we hope before long to see estab- 

shed in the more complete of our faculties 

lairs devoted to the history of medicine. 

.eretofore but little effort has been made to 

pcite in the student a taste for more thor- 

igh research. A properly arranged course 

lectures should cover the progress of the 

t as a whole, the careers of its leaders, and 

e birth, rise and fall of each prominent 

&gt;och or theory, as well as the philosophical 

asons for their existence and disappearance. 

ach branch of medicine, like every promi- 

:nt group of diseases, has its well defined 

jstory. 

As a necessary part of the work, the his- 
jry of charlatanry and of the ignorant or 
te trained empiricism that restricts itself 



to some one medical detail, should not be 
neglected; it all forms a part of the history 
of the art, even as an humble scullion forms 
an important part of the great establishment 
of a royal palace. There is here a strong 
analogy between fashion and medicine; for 
as many of the innovations of the former are 
originated by the despised demi-monde, so in 
medicine many an innovation or even great 
departure has originated in the fertile and 
venturesome mind of some utterly reckless 
quack. That great admixture of science 
and charlatanry — Bombastus Paracelsus — 
wrought such a change in the methods of 
treatment, upheaved pathological ideas, and 
raised such a war and such dissensions in 
medicine as he never dreamed of doing — a 
war whose remote little wavelets disturbed 
even the serenity of the surgeons of the 
Union army at the beginning of our great 
Civil War, when of a sudden and much to 
their disgust they found that the Surgeon- 
General had sided with Guy Patin, of the 
times of Louis XIII., in regard to antimony! 

Good old slim and tall Patin — who, by the 
way, had much in his personality and indi- 
viduality that reminds one of Professor Gross 
— was one of the most stubborn and formi- 
dable of opponents to the indiscriminate and 
murderous use of antimony which was then 
creating such havoc. Many of our Western 
men — fighting stubborn malarial complica- 
tions on the Ohio and Mississippi, and thrown 
in contact with the excessively emeticizing 
and purging disciples of Thompson, and hav- 
ing to deal with the almost impossible-condi- 
tioned livers and dried skins of the lowlands 
of Missouri, southern Illinois, and of Indiana, 
— had nearly lost their heads from the milieux 
in which they were placed: located on malari- 
ous bottoms, with a set of iron-constitutioned 
patients who demanded the most active, rapid, 
and drastic treatment, and surrounded by 
a wild crop of ignorant and irresponsible 
Thompsonians; and tartar emetic and calomel 
were called in to antagonize lobelia. 

These methods, carried into practice upon 
the softer-tempered constitutions of the more 
juicy and redder-blooded residents of the 
Middle and Northwestern States, were fol- 
lowed by most disastrous results, and auto- 
cratic powers were called into requisition to 
save from annihilation that part of the army

show the made by the "salivators" 

of the period, although most of the cases of 
tartar-emetic poisoning were quietly buried 
without saving the specimens.

such confined in Ward 21 of the I . S 
eral Hospital at Fortress Monroe. Wa(d 21 
was then detailed as a prisoners' ward exclu- 
sively, for the use of the Military Prison. I 
was in charge of that ward at the time, and 
was filled with more science than experience. 
I shall always feel thankful to Doctor Pease 
— a short, fat, asthmatic doctor, but a sensi- 
ble old soul, who had formerly practiced in 
Connecticut — for his sound advice, which at 
once cut short, then and forever, any admira- 
tion that I might have possessed for the 
tartar-emetic treatment of pneumonia. The 
drummer lived after a radical change of 
treatment to whiskey and milk and muriate 
of ammonia, and was able to return after the 
close of the war to assist in reconstructing 
the South; and I have never forgotten the 
lesson. A better knowledge of the history 
of medicine would certainly have made it 
unnecessary.

EXPERT TESTiriONY.* 

BY SAMUEL W. r.URROUGHS.f 
ntinued from page 2jy. ) 

In view of a previous study of these decis- 
ions, and others of less interest though some- 
what analogous, I was carefully guided in 
the chief and cross examination of certain 
expert witnesses in the successful prosecution 
of some very important cases arising in this 
county, while in the capacity of your prose- 
cuting attorney. 

In the case of People vs. Hull, wherein 
Hull shot and killed Dubois, Doctor John 



* Read before the Wayne County Medical So- 
ciety. 

I F,\-Prosecuting Attorney for Wayne County, 
Michigan. 



McCullum of Harper Hospital testified as an 

expert, in answer to my questions, that he 
was a regular and practicing physician and 
surgeon; that Dubois was brought to the 
hospital and that he examined carefully his 
linds; that this examination was made in 
the evening, just after the shooting and while 
Dubois was still alive; that as a result of this 
examination the Doctor found " a small open-) 
ing in the right cheek, just over the jaw-! 
bone, . . . and the opening was about 1 
one-eighth of an inch in diameter, very] 
small, and little blood oozed from it." Thatl 
was all he could discover thus. He did 
not probe the wound at all, because he 
deemed it inadvisable at that time on account 
of the shot. He also testified, in answer to 
me, that Dubois died at the hospital the next] 
morning at about three o'clock, November I 
22(1, 1890, as a result, in his judgment, of the! 
gunshot wound that he saw upon the head of J 
the deceased. 

He also held an autopsy, and made a re- 
port of it as follows; 

External wound near angle of jaw, sur- 
rounded by powder marks, outer edge dark 
in color; dry blood protruding from nostrils 
over outer angle of right eye, mark of coi 
tusion present one inch long, centric portic 
black in color. 

Cut was made, passing from symphysi 
menti, around angle of jaw, to mastoid por 
tion of the temporal bone. Tissues c\ 
through, infiltrated with blood. Ball pass 
behind angle of ramus of inferior maxilla! 
bone, passed upwards, backwards and in- 
wards. 

Scalp removed; bruise over eye showing 
extravasation of blood beneath periosteum. 
No depression in skull. 

Top of skull removed; considerable effu- 
sion of blood beneath membranes, gushini 
out when opened. Congestion of whole sur- 
face of brain; more effusion at occipital por- 
tion. Ball passed through, striking styloit 
of temporal bone, thence through petrous 
portion into right lobe of cerebellum, when 
it was found at about the centre and ex- 
tracted. 

Right posterior lobe of cerebrum con- 
tained cavity which would hold about three 
ounces of blood, caused by pressure. 

Offered and received in evidence without 
objection. 

The theory of defense was self-defense, 
and that while the fatal shot was fired by

defendant he was lying on his back and being 
jpounded by Dubois, and that as a result of 
the position of the two men thus the ball 
entered near angle of jaw, passing upwards, 
backwards and inwards at an angle of about 
forty-five degrees. 

The People's contention was that the men 
were standing about twenty feet apart when 
defendant fired the first shot, and that when 
he fired the second or fatal shot Dubois had 
closed in within about three or four feet from 
defendant, and in falling fell with his head 
; between the legs of defendant, pitching for- 
'ward, hence the blood on the bottom of de- 
fendant's pantaloons. 

Mr. Hawley, in support of defendant's 
theory, put this question on cross-examina- 
tion: 

Q. — Doctor, will you turn your right to the jury 
so as to illustrate I I want you to illustrate, as 
inear as you can, the direction in which this bullet 
wound entered the cheek, whether it ranged up- 
vvard or downward as it entered? 

1 The answer was: 

That is impossible to tell. The wound was not 

acerated at all; it was a small circular opening, 

rery circumscribed. So you can only tell that the 

kdlet must have glanced backward off that bone 

nderneath. 

Thus Mr. Hawley succeeded in drawing 
rom the witness the fact that the bullet, in 
ntering, passed upward at an angle of about 
: ixty degrees from the horizontal. 

On redirect examination I propounded this 
uestion and obtained the following answer: 

Q. — After making a close observation and ex- 
nination in reference to the subject matter of Mr. 
awley's last question, can you tell whether the 
diet struck the man when he was lying down, or 
hether it was the result of the glancing of the 
.diet after hitting the jaw-bone? 

A. — I could not tell what position the man was 
I judged it would be from the glancing. 

I It will be observed that the theory of the 
•fense was not sustained by the testimony 
&lt; this expert witness. So Mr. Hawley called 
octor John J. Mulheron, and, having called 
U attention to the testimony of Doctor 
-cCullum and to the report of the autopsy, 
pceeded with this question: 

Q. —Under such circumstances, and upon the 
hich you have before you as to the probabil- 
i' of the proximity of the weapon to the man's face 
^en the shot went off — 



Here I objected, on the ground that the 
jury were just as good judges of that fact, 
they having heard the evidence, as this phy- 
sician was. I did not argue my objection, 
not wishing to deprive defendant of any ad- 
vantage obtained on this line; and the wit- 
ness was allowed to answer: 

I should think that the muzzle of the weapon was 
within a foot of the man's face. 

He also testified hypothetically, in answer 
to Mr. Hawley, that the bullet would not be 
apt to have taken that course if, when the 
pistol was fired, the man was standing erect; 
that the shot must have been fired from be- 
low upwards, and that the bullet would have 
taken such a course if the man was lying flat 
on the ground and the other was on top of 
him. 

So the physician who made the personal 
examination of Dubois, both before and after 
death, could not tell whether the man was 
standing or lying down when shot, but 
thought the angle of the course of the bullet 
was the result of the ball's glancing from the 
bone; while the other physician based his 
opinion upon the examining physician's testi- 
mony, without having seen Dubois at all, 
and gave that opinion to the effect that the 
bullet would not be apt to have taken that 
course if, when the pistol was fired, the man 
was standing erect. 

Mr. Hawley also called Doctor Wright, 
who testified that with the aid of the micro- 
scope and the use of certain chemicals he 
made an examination of the pantaloons and 
coat of defendant, and found blood stains 
upon them, finding blood-corpuscles, or the 
solid particles of blood. 

Upon my cross-examination of the Doctor 
I elicited the statement that he found upon 
defendant's clothing staining material which 
was not blood; found substance which, in his 
judgment, was paint, and as a medical ex- 
pert he could not tell whether the blood 
found was that of a human being or that of 
a warm-blooded animal. Doctor Reynolds, 
who helped make the examination-of-blood 
tests, was called by the prosecution and 
testified substantially the same pro and con, 
illustrating the peculiar differences of opinion 
in medical experts, and especially when 
twisted by the logic of trial lawyers who are 
up in the art of expert examination.

Bigley, then about fifty-two years of age, 
shot and killed Fred Garand. Defendant's 
brother was manager of the business, and 
defendant had at various times been em- 
ployed at the slaughter house; but had been 
discharged on each occasion for drunkenness. 
His victim was an assistant to the manager, 
and was an industrious young man about 
twenty-four years of age. 

Bigley laid his last discharge — which o 
curred early in July — at young (iarand'sdoor, 
and he appeared during the noon hour of the 
fatal day in the yard where (iarand, with 
other hands, was eating his dinner. Raising 
his carbine to his shoulder, he deliberately 
pointed it at (iarand, and, with the remark, 
"Get out of the way, boys, I want to shoot J 
he pulled the trigger, sending a bullet through 
Garand's abdomen. 

The wounded man was taken immecii

minutes as a result of the shooting. 

ey was arrested at a saloon or 
block from the scene of his crime, within 
half an hour. On the trial in the Recorder's 
Court, in October (2 2d and 23d), 1891, I ap- 
peared and prosecuted. 

rley was defended by Judge Robe K. 
Frazer, who very ingeniously contended that 
1 hint's reason had been dethrone I

drunk at the time, but that he was dec 
ized and his nervous system was com; 
shattered as a result of habitual intoxi&lt; 
that his mind was gone to the extent that he 
was not responsible for his rash act. 

Doctor W. F. Metcalf, who saw deo 
and examined the wound, was called, and 
having testified that the gunshot wound was

the cause of death, Mr. Frazer tried to draw 
from this physician — basing his questions 
upon the hypothesis of habitual intoxication 
— the opinion that Bigley had become irre- 
sponsible by the constant use of liquor as a 
beverage; but in this he failed. The witness 
declared that he was not an expert and had 
made no special study of the mental results 
of hard drinking. 

I drew from all defendant's witnesses and 
from himself the fact that all his drinking 
and all his use of liquor as a beverage was 
the result of his own voluntary and wrongful 
indulgence; and contended that, this being 
so established, insanity thus brought about 
and which affected no person until aroused 
by sudden anger, and which subsided the 
moment the angry passions passed, was no 
excuse for crime. In support of my conten- 
tion on the part of the prosecution I cited 
the following authority: 

An offender under the influence of intoxi- 
cation can have no privilege by reason of a 
madness voluntarily contracted. If an offense 
be committed by a party during a fit of 
drunkenness brought on by his own wrongful 
indulgence, no matter how great the depriva- 
tion of reason may have been, it will not 
excuse him from punishment; but he is 
answerable to the law equally as if he had 
perpetrated the act while in the full posses- 
sion of his faculties.* 

The trial resulted in the conviction of 
Bigley of murder in the second degree, and 
he is now in the penitentiary serving his 
sentence. 

Fred Luth was cut on the head on the 
evening of August 3d, 1891, and died the 
next morning. Christopher O'Brien was in- 
formed against by me for the murder of 
Luth, and upon his trial Doctor Richard J. 
Kelly, in answer to my questions, testified: 

I am a physician and surgeon, and have been 
about eight years in Detroit. I was called into 
Fred Luth's place on the morning of August 4th. 
I examined his body and found two wounds on his 
head, one about two and a half inches long across 
the top of his head, and the second one on the left 
side of his head about three-fourths of an inch poste- 
rior to the lower angle of the eye, over the temporal 
muscle. Both wounds penetrated to the bone, and

ties cited in support of this doctrine. 



were made with a sharp instrument. Fred Luth 
was dead when I saw him, and in my judgment 
his death was caused by the wound on the temple. 
I made the post-mortem together with Doctor 
Siebert, a friend of his and an assistant of mine. 

Doctor John F. Siebert, in answer to my 
questions, testified: 

I am a practicing physician and surgeon. Au- 
gust 3d, 1891, was located at 818 Gratiot avenue. 
Knew Fred Luth before he was hurt. . . . Was 
called upon to make an examination of Fred Luth 
on the night of August 3d, about 10.15 P - M - 
He came to my place of business, coming up stairs, 
and I found he was all covered with blood, and he 
told me that he - had been cut on the head, and 
asked me to make an examination to see the extent 
of the injury. 

After washing off his head, I found a wound 
across the top of the head and side of his head about 
two inches long, and another over the left temple, 
from the external angle of the eye, over the eye- 
brow, slanting across the temple; it must have been 
two inches long. I examined the injury and could 
not find any fracture, and did not think the injury 
was as serious as it was. 

He had lost a great deal of blood, and in conse- 
quence was very weak. ... I did up the 
wounds, so that they were partly sewed up, and 
sent him home. At the time he was perfectly con- 
scious yet. I did not expect the result at all that 
the next morning brought about. About a quarter 
to seven the next morning John Luth came to my 
office and told me to come down, that his brother 
was dying. ... I went over, but found him 
dead. 

I . . . made a post-mortem examination. 
The cut over the left temple was the cut that caused 
his death. 

I knew Mr. Fred Luth in his lifetime; he was a 
healthy looking man. 

Q. — Did you have any conversation with Fred 
Luth as to who cut him ? 

A. — He told me. 

Q. — State what he said to you about it ? 

Objected to as incompetent. Overruled. 
Exception. 

A. — I asked him what caused the wounds, and 
he said he had been cut by a knife by Mr. O'Brien. 
I didn't ask for details at all. 

On the trial O'Brien was defended by G. 
X. M. Collier and Geo. F. Robison, attorneys. 

On the part of the prosecution, and in ad- 
dition to the testimony of the physicians, I 
introduced testimony tending to show the 
following facts: 

That defendant first assaulted John Luth 
and then his brother, the deceased; that then 
defendant was driven out of the place by the

Luth with the knife; that he had made pre-

that he v. it and only wished he

. he cut I.uth was be- 

Luth was jealous of him — and this 

admission was made voluntarily the next 

morning after apprehension. 

The theory of the defense was self-defense, 
and that defendant did not do the cutting, 
and that he used no knife against decc 
that he was attacked by deceased with a 
chisel, and it was insisted upon by him that 
the wounds were inflicted during the affray 
by it— in the scuffle. 

Verdict: Murder in the second degree. An 
appeal was taken, and Mr. Justice Grant 
handed down the opinion of the appellate 
court, from which I quote: 

iert testified, under objection 
and exception, that the deceased said "he 
had been cut by a knife by Mr. O'Brien." 
This statement was not a part of the rcsgesta, 

and was therefore incompetent. The ques- 
tion of the use of the knife was one of the 

important in the case. A conviction 
for murder could scarcely have been main- 
ss the jury were convinced that 
the wound was thus inflicted. 

While the case made against the prisoner, 

from this statement, is very stron. 

innot say it is so convincing that the 
admission of this testimony was nut prejudi- 
cial error. For this reason the judgment is 
reversed and a new trial ordered. 

Morse, C.J md Montgomery, J. J., 

concurred. McGrath, J., did not sit.* 

The case was retried, resulting in a verdict 
of manslaughter. ( &gt;n the appeal and retrial 
the defense was reinforced by Attorney James

and upon this claim and certain rulings

'iid new trial; and upon his third 
with which I hail nothing to do, hn\ 
out of office, he obtained an acquittal. 

In the preparation and inv -n o 

these r trial, and many others of like 

importance to which I could refer but for 
lack of time, and in which expert testimony 
was absolutely necessary, I have learned: 

If a physician has devoted himself exclu- 
sively to one branch of his profession and 
o practical experience in the subject 
matter to which he is called to testify — as if 
an oculist is called to testify as an expert on 
the question of insanity — his testimony would 
be inadmissible: 

A physician whose habit it had been, when 
his patients required medical treatment for 
insanity, to call in the services of a physician 
who had made a special study of mental dis- 
eases, or to recommend their removal to a 
hospital for the insane, — was held to be in- 
competent to express an opinion upon the 
question of insanity:* 

Medical practice confined to the treatment 
of ordinary diseases does not qualify a physi- 
cian to testify as an expert upon insanity based 
upon hypothetical interrogations as to sup- 
posed facts of which he had no personal 
knowledge. f But his testimony would be 
admissible if he had a personal knowledge of 
the facts, or if he had studied the subject of 
psychological medicine: 

It has been held that a physician who had 
been in practice for several years, but who 
had never had experience as to the effect 
upon health of breathing illuminating gas, 
could not testify in relation thereto:;]; 

It has also been held, and it is well settled, 
that the opinion of a witness not founded on 
science, but rather as a theory of morals, or 
ethics, is inadmissible in evidence. And in 
this regard it wiil make no difference whether 
given by professional or non-professional wit- 
Where the question was whether a 
man who had committed suicide was sane or

insane, the opinion of a physician that no 
sane man would commit suicide in a Christian 
country was held to be inadmissible, as being 
founded, not on the phenomena of mind, but 
rather on a theory of morals, religion, and a 
future state:* 

And the opinions of medical practitioners 
are inadmissible on the question whether a 
physician has honorably and faithfully dis- 
charged his duty to his medical brethren :f 

And the opinions of professional witnesses 
cannot be asked upon mere abstract ques- 
tions of science, having no proper relation to 
the facts upon which the jury are to pass. 

In the careful study of the law and other 
works of jurisprudence I have learned that 
many men eminent in one branch of their 
profession have but a superficial knowledge 
of other branches, and a physician who may 
be very able and learned in certain subjects 
connected with his profession may be quite 
ignorant of certain intricate questions of 
medical science; so that if all questions of 
medical science were left for the jury upon 
the examination in chief of the expert wit- 
ness, and counsel on the other side were not 
sufficiently posted for the purpose of investi- 
gation by conducting a rigid and proper 
cross-examination to elicit the truth and get 
at the very foundation of the witness's knowl- 
edge from a scientific standpoint, that side in 
all probability would be prohibited from 
availing itself of the advantages which it 
might otherwise be entitled to. 

It is therefore necessary, to a thorough and 
enlightened examination of an expert witness 
on an intricate question of medical or other 
scientific investigation, that the examiner 
should have made himself as familiar as pos- 
sible with the subject matter of inquiry, to 
prepare himself for the examination of the 
expert witness so as to meet the emergencies 
of the case. Accordingly, in my practice I 
have spent days and often weeks in the care- 
ful investigation of the scientific questions 
involved, in order to get at the truth of the 
matter, knowing that this was necessary, to 
aid both court and jury, who for want of time 
and knowledge could not be expected to be 
familiar with the questions raised. 



On the other hand it is the duty of the ex- 
pert witness to tell just what he knows about 
the case under investigation, truthfully, as if 
it were the truth. He must not exaggerate 
or color. If his testimony be based upon 
personal knowledge from examination and 
observation, let him narrate the facts of his 
knowledge, to the point, in plain and simple 
language. If it is to be the expression of an 
opinion based upon the testimony of other 
witnesses in the case, let him thoroughly 
understand the hypothesis of the same and 
then render such an opinion as will be ma- 
terial, concise, honest, and convincing. He 
will then pass with confidence and ease the 
ordeal of his cross-examination, and his ex- 
pert testimony will become evidence, material 
in character and of assistance and advantage 
to the court and jury in the rendition of a 
just verdict. 



LECTURES ON THE HISTORY OF MEDI- 
CINE.* 

BY ROSWELL PARK, A.M., M.D. 

(Copyrighted.) 

[Continued from page 23 8. \ 

That the eighteenth century, up to its 
close, was the golden age of medicine, is due 
to the prevalence during that period of a 
strong idealistic undertone, as a result of 
which any learned occupation caused the 
scholar to be held in higher esteem than is 
the case even to-day. — Medicine was then 
regarded as a conscientious vocation and not as 
a mere business or trade; indeed, general 
scientific knowledge more widely prevailed 
among the better class of the profession, and 
there was much less of that one-sided, narrow 
education that obtains to-day. The profes- 
sion, moreover, was not overcrowded; physi- 
cians were neither too few nor too numerous, 
consequently their social position was higher. 
Again, the relations between doctor and pa- 
tient were more intimate, most practitioners 
being of the type described as " family physi- 
cians," and those possessed of the doctorate 
degree ranked among the gentry rather than 
as artisans. They were for the most part 
fully devoted to their calling; and, moreover,

of the century there was only one disse I

only thre&lt; tions in a score of years — 

though now subjects can be had there in 
abundance at a ridiculously low figure; cada- 
extremely scarce in Vienna as late 
as [765; and for a long time the only places 
in London where the study of anatomy could 
be legally pursued were the College of Phy- 
sicians and the College of Surgeons, and the 

e that hampered John Hunter in this 
direction is historical. The crime of "Burk- 
ing" became known in Hunter's day: murder 

ommitted and the victim sold for pur- 
poses of dissection — for at this time, as " body- 
snatching" was a necessity, those who pur- 
chased cadavers asked few questions, and 
the fees paid were of course high. 

The first clinical institution in Austria was 
lized in Vienna, in 1754, by VanSwieten, 
though there was an "ambulatory clinic" 
(out-patient department) in Prague nine 
years before. During the century, however,

In the Hotel Dieu, at Paris, several patients 

sometimes put in the same bed; in 
Vienna the Allgemeines ECrankenhaus was 
composed of seventeen hospitals that subse-

London numerous hospitals were founded, 
and as the medi&lt; a] staff of each became 
eminent they attracted numerous pupils; but 
later it became ne&lt; essary to relieve the hos- 
pital wards, and private institutions for in- 
struction were established by popular teachers, 
the most celebrated being the "Windmill 
Street School of Anatomy," founded by 



William Hunter about 1770, and the private

upon the accessory branches: botany, - 
istry and natural history were the recreation 
Of many Students and physicians. Pupils 
enjoyed the privilege of studying what they 
as they do practically to-day in the 
Portuguese university of Coimbra, — and pro- 
ercised to the utmost their individu- 
ality in teaching. In Spain, natural sciences 
found no admission, and even so late as 
no instruction in these branches was given, 
as they were regarded as dangerous to the 
purity of the faith; mineralogy for mining 
purposes was an exception, for even the most 
faithful Catholic needs money. 

At the universities, medical students were 
not permitted to go out without their scho- 
lastic cloaks — a regulation that still obtains 
in Spain. That the number of students has 
enormously multiplied may be seen from the 
fact that the little university of Giessen, with 
scarcely any medical school at all, has always 
more students than had Halle in the days of 
the famous Hoffmann. In the middle of the 
last century Wiirzburg had at one time but 
three medical students, while to-day it has in 
the neighborhood of five hundred, 
then it was complained than on account of 
the number of students there was an edu- 
cated proletariat arising, and in 1791 it was 
proposed, in Austria, that the rush for study 
should be repressed. 

Among the Continental students the revels 
and bad behavior of past centuries were not 
to any great extent corrected; fights and de- 
bauchery were very common, and all sorts of 
orgies and bacchanals prevailed. The pro- 
fessors were in large measure independent of 
the State, and a single individual often repre- 
sented a number of branches now taught by 
special chairs. When indisposed to lecture, 
they simply posted upon the blackboard

the matter. In 1777 Vienna had 147 medical 
teachers, and in Germany there were two to 
every thirty-nine students. That in the last 
century one man often accomplished more

than a great number of average teachers do 
to-day, is amply demonstrated by the lives 
of Boerhaave, Haller, and others. Then, 
too, the Latin tongue was generally employed 
for purposes of instruction, though surgeons 
for the most part lectured in the vernacular; 
Cullen, in 1770, was the first in Great Britain 
to deliver purely medical lectures in English; 
and as the clergy gradually retired from the 
ranks of the profession, Latin more and more 
fell into disuse. Strange to say, as the 
clerical influence waned, the Jews began to 
i enter medicine, the movement beginning 
'about 1791 in France, under the promulga- 
tion of "civil equality" ideas; previously the 
Hebrews had been an almost universally sup- 
pressed people, and in Berlin were permitted 
: to enter and leave the city by only one gate 
1 and were forbidden to learn or write pure 
j German, in consequence whereof their dia- 
i lect was a Hebraic-Teutonic jargon that 
jeven to-day prevails in some portions of 
! western Europe. Educated Jews were few 
I in number, since attendance upon universi- 
ties was ordinarily denied them, although 

■ long before they had been admitted at 
[Salamanca, Toledo, Salernum, and Montpel- 

(lier. In Austria the prohibition was not re- 
1 moved until 1789, and even then so bitter 

■ was the prejudice against the Semitic race 
rjthat the clergy protested vigorously. It was 
I the same clerical body that, in 1667, protested 
Jlwith the greatest vehemence against allowing 
[[Hebrew physicians to pass through the gates 
I (of Wtirtemburg without paying toll", declaring 
I that it was " better to die with Christ than be 
jlcured by Jews who were aided by the devil." 

Professors were often attached to the 

Icourts of their various sovereigns, and at one 

I time the French court possessed a faculty of 

■forty-eight physicians, surgeons, and apothe- 

Iparies, the first two physicians being required 

jjco attend every morning when the king arose; 

.1, hence originated the titles, still known in 

flG-ermany, of "Hofrath" and "Geheimrath." 

Medical fees, as a rule, were very small, 

fuhough there were exceptional instances in 

■which enormous sums were bestowed: Joseph 

. [I., of Austria, gave Guerin, who was sum- 

JjTioned from Paris in consultation, an honor- 

lirium of 171,000 marks and made him a 

Daronet. Taking all things into consideration, 

K:he income of the average practitioner in the 



eighteenth century would be in the neighbor- 
hood of $1,000, which however was equiva- 
lent to three times that amount to-day. 
Fothergill, whose highest income in a single 
year was $25,000, bequeathed to the poor of 
London $1,000,000: Sir Astley Cooper had 
a yearly income of from $75,000 to $100,000, 
but it may be remembered that his practice 
during the first year netted him just $26, and 
that it was four years later before his income 
reached the sum of $500. 

The physician of the last century was, at 
least on occasions of moment, very different 
from other men, and to be recognized by his 
dress. A cap was placed upon his head 
when he graduated, in recognition of the fact 
that physicians at an earlier period belonged 
to the learned or clerical profession; and 
in later life he wore a purplish or scarlet 
cloak (to distinguish him from lawyers whose 
professional color was yellow, and from 
theologians who then as now sported the 
sombre black). The regulation full-dress 
costume of the English physician of the last 
century demanded a well powdered wig, silk 
coat, knee breeches with stockings, buckled 
shoes, lace ruffles, cap, and gold-headed cane, 
to which, in cold weather, was added a muff 
— to preserve his delicacy of touch. 

Surgeons were still strictly separated from 
physicians, even in education; nor were they 
esteemed as equal in rank, until the French 
revolution brought about the doctrine of civil 
equality; perhaps this is one reason why this 
branch of the medical art made less con- 
spicuous progress until recent times. The 
change was brought about, in France, by the 
abolition of eighteen universities and fifteen 
colleges of medicine, the Royal Society of 
Medicine (founded in 1776), and the Acad- 
emy of Surgery (founded in 1731); but by 
this abolition charlatanism acquired such 
speedy control that the arrangement was 
soon abandoned. Thus it came about that 
surgical instruction was given in special in- 
stitutions or in the universities, and the con- 
ditions of instruction finally improved. When 
the College of St. Come was abolished in 
1753 the Societe de Chirurgie, founded in 
1731, became the Academie de Chirurgie; 
and when the French Academy was formed 
in 1795, the Academie was merged into its 
medical department. The Ecole Pratique,

where Desault and Ch 
tabiished in 1750 for th- 
in England the K 
of Surgeons was not incorporated until 1800. 

Austria, in 1785, the Josephinum 
opened by Joseph II., who also erected per- 
manent military hospitals in Prague, Brum, 
Milan, Mantua, Pesth, Olmfitz, etc.; he 

I the "Joseph's Akademie" in order 
to educate military surgeons and thus over- 
come the defects of army surgery; the 
-ephinum unquestionably exerted great 
inrluenre in elevating the social and military 
position of army surgeons, and attained his- 
torical importance after Brambilla compelled 
the recognition of surgeons as social equals 
of other members of the medical profession. 
As the res lit of these improvements the vari- 
ous armies of Europe were soon furnished 
with better medical officers. Prior to this, 
too, the field hospitals had been as bsdly 
mismanaged as their civil prototypes, and the 
substitution in 1793 of movable hospital-, 
suggested at the close of the sixteenth cen- 
tury by Henry IV. of France, was scarcely 
an improvement. The whole system suffered 
from perpetuation of the dual and distinct 
functions of the physician and the surgeon, 
to destroy which was a part of the design of 
the Josephinum. How unpleasant was the 
position of the army surgeon up to this date 
may be inferred from the fact that in 1758 
one was subjected to corporeal punishment 
at the command of his colonel, and that a 
general upon his death-bed could leave 
orders that fifty blows be given each of his 
medical staff in case the post mortem dis- 
proved the diagnosis. 

In Austria, at the beginning of the Seven 
rs' War. all military surgeons of the 
Protestant faith were compelled to become 
Catholics or leave the service. The condi- 
tion of the wounded soldiers was as deplor- 
able as can well be imagined; but upon this 
subject I cannot dwell. 

The tendency of the nineteenth century 
seems to be a continuation, and perhaps in 
some respects an exaggeration, of the condi- 
tion obtaining in France during the previous 
century; in other words, the world has be- 
come practically an enormous school of path- 
ological anatomy and diagnosis — a school 



inaugurated by Bichat, as representir. . 
called scientific or exact medicine. Philo- 
sophically this has been a century of reaction 
against the ic! : the preceding age; it 

places the individual, rather than the idea, in 
the foreground. The mutual influence oi 
medicine, philosophy and the natural sci-; 
ences is less conspicuous now than formerly. 
Recent philosophers who have exercised the 
greatest influence are: Schelling, who heldc 
to the equality of the real and the ideal; 
Hegel, whose supreme principle was absolute! 
reason, of which religion was regarded as a 
representation; Hartmann, whose philosophyl 
of the "unconscious" depends largely uponj 
the results of natural sciences, embraced 
v in ism, and is in many respects an exten- 
sion and completion of Schopenhauer- 
simism and doctrine of the soul. But onel 
who has exercised still more influence uponl 
our profession is Comte, whose positivism* 
contrasted strongly with the idealism and! 
atheism of Schelling, and who required only] 
this of philosophy, namely, that it should 
work out the general ideas and results of 
other sciences; his most important follower 
was Claude Bernard, and upon these two the 
whole exact school of France is based. But 
the most influential philosophic doctrines of 
this or any other century have been those 
emanating from Charles Darwin, Herbert 
Spencer, Ernst Haeckel, Alfred Wallace, and 
their contemporaries and followers. Darwin 
(1809-1882) was the grandson of Erasmus 
Darwin, already mentioned, and his " Varia- 
tion of Animals and Plants under Domestica- 
tion," "Origin of Species," and "Descent 
of Man" have found place in all modern 
languages. The system known by his name 
is the pure science of nature— is founded 
upon scientific investigation — and by its 
merits alone has found almost universal ac- 
ceptance; it has been added to and further 
elucidated by the efforts of Haeckel and 
Spencer. 

When it is declared that medicine of the 
present is influenced by no system, it is speed- 
ily found on critical analysis that this 
error. It necessarily follows the realistic and 
materialistic, as readily as it did the teach- 
ings and doctrines of natural philosophy; and 
in consequence " medical thought," so called, 
is just as one-sided to-day as at any time

in the history of the art. The watchword of 
to-day, "natural scientific tendency," veils 
but does not take away its philosophic prin- 
ciples, and so our ridicule of earlier medical 
systems is quite unjustifiable. A modern 
historian aptly remarks that the medicine of 
the present " embraces nothing but a theorem 
of investigation by the senses." 

Discoveries in botany, the result of better 
knowledge of natural history and more accu- 
rate habits of study, have influenced modern 
progress not a little; have led to better classi- 
fication and broader knowledge. The natu- 
ral system of De Candolle (1778-1841) of 
Geneva, and of Endiicher of Vienna, called 
into existence the so-called natural historical 
school of medicine; the researches into plant 
cells by Schleiden and Baumgartner, and the 
almost contemporaneous discovery of animal 
cells by Schwann, became, in course of time, 
the origin of recent cellular pathology; then 
came microscopic botany, and the influence 
of the lower fungi in the production of fer- 
mentation and putrefaction. 

Similarly, too, the laws of physics have 
been shown to have an inseparable connec- 
tion with anatomy and physiology, and their 
study has become a most important aid in the 
; experimental researches of to-day; through 
Helmholz they brought in the ophthalmo- 
scope; thermal electricity, for the discovery 
of which medicine is indebted to Seebeck; a 
[better knowledge of optics, thanks to Fraun- 
hofer, who was equally expert in electricity; 
spectrum analysis, invented by Kirchhoff ; and 
[the varied efforts of Faraday, Graham Bell, 
Thomas Alva Edison, and Daguerre, the lat- 
ter better known for his invention of photog- 
raphy. Finally medicine is immeasurably 
lindebted to Tyndall and Huxley for their 
teaching of the correlation and conservation 
of energy. 

Chemistry also has performed its share, 
[and as applied to physiology is a discovery 
almost wholly within the present century. 
The new nomenclature serves a practical pur- 
Dose in that it is now possible to portray 
:hemical combinations and isomerism in a 
graphic and at least semi comprehensive way. 
\mong the chemists may be specially men- 
tioned Bertholet, whose laws are as well 
mown as they are succinct; Humboldt; 
Berzelius; Dumas; Chevreuil, who recently 



died at the age of almost 100; Magendie; 
Orfila the toxicologist; Gmelin, eminent in 
physiological chemistry; Rose, perfector of 
organic analysis; Wohler, who first made 
organic alkaloids; Bunsen; Sir Humphrey 
Davy; Marsh; Faraday; Graham; Young, 
who first showed the industrial value of coal; 
and Guy Lussac. 

Upon medicine, zoology also, with compar- 
ative anatomy and physiology, has had a 
wonderful influence; here may be noted the 
names of Cuvier, Oken, Bilharz, Brehm, 
Wagner, Leuckart, Richard Owen, William 
Carpenter, and last, but by no means least, 
Thomas Huxley. 

. But perhaps the most significant feature of 
the age has been the wonderful development 
of scientific associations and the publication 
of medical and scientific literature. W'hether 
these have yet reached their climax is per- 
haps an open question, but the consequent 
widening circle of readers, as well as of 
writers, seems to imply that there will be for 
a long time to come no lack of activity in 
this direction. ■ In the United States more 
than in any other country, medical societies 
and associations innumerable have sprung up, 
and to such a degree that (in the Eastern 
States at least) there are few counties that 
cannot boast of a medical organization. 

During the present century foreign univer- 
sities have decreased in number, partly owing 
to consolidations and partly by surrender of 
charters; for instance, the old University of 
Ingolstadt was united with that of Landshut, 
and in 1827 was removed to Munich; in 
18 16 the University of Wiirtemberg was 
united with that of Halle; the University of 
Bonn was abolished in 1792, but revived in 
1 818. A few new universities, like that of 
Zurich, have been founded. In the quaint 
old town of Prague the old German univer- 
sity was, in 1883, divided, and there now exist 
in that city two universities side by side, in 
one of which German is spoken, in the other 
Bohemian. 

It will thus be seen that the nineteenth 
century is essentially an era of modern sci- 
ence, with whose dawn was sounded the 
death knell of the "demon of disease" and 
his twin brother "visitation." In 1801 the 
first experiment in steam navigation took 
place upon the Thames. In 1807 the slave

more or less long-lived-

em they become more ephemeral. Those of 
the ear i the present century took 

root in the soil of the eighteenth — for in- 
- '-called "theory of excitement" 
of k ; -1835), which endeavored 

LOU Id into one the Brunonian errors and 
the fancies of Schelling. According to it, 
life depends upon irritability, but is inherent 
in the organism as an independent feature; 
I recognizes both irritability and solidism, 
while Brown considered the former alone. 
add an after-thought a chemical or 

qualitative potency (oxygen) in order to ac- 
count for alterations of quality. Roeschlaub 
inclined first toward natural philosophy, then, 
owing to an inherent theological and polemi- 
cal bias (he was originally intended for the 
church), to mysticism and theosophy; finally, 
with a courage almost unexampled, he upset 
all his former teachings by admitting he 
mistaken. To him was opposed Hufeland, 
who wrote on the "Lengthening of Life," 
is noted for a warm and benevolent heart, 
and possessed no small penetration, as is 
evidenced by his aphorism, " Successful treat- 
ment requires one-third science and :

applied to a theory advanced by Kasori (1762 
-18 Milan, that combined Methodism 

with Brunonism; by Baas it is characterized 
as a "genuine blot upon the human heart 
beyond any other of the vario OS." 

Long centuries of experience and the con- 
clusions of great and venerable minds may 
go for naught, as kasori abundantly demon- 
strated. The theories of Brown were then 
taught as his own to his classes in Pavia, 
showing he was not above plagiarism; his

or any other h -rem sprang up in 

the midst of such measures'- It is an old 

saying, there is no folly that will not secure 

a following; and, strai y. kasori had 

a numerous and eminent one. 

As just intimated, Homoeopathy was th 
natural reaction against such heroic me; 
ures; in the rebound the other extreme w; 
reached, even to practical therapeutic nihil- 
ism. Now instead of venesection and di 
medication came the theories expounded bf 
Hahnemann (1753-1843). which denied dis- 
ease, admitting only symptoms. This apostli 
of homceopathy was the son of a porcelain 
painter in Meissen; he studied in Leipzi; 
and in Vienna, and later practiced in various 
cities, including Dresden and Leipzig. "Sim- 
ilia similibus cur a ntur" was not original with 
him, as it long before had been formulated 
by Hippocrates, and later by Paracelsus. Of 
the life and labors of Hahnemann much 
might be told; but this is not the time or 
place to go into the subject. 

An offshoot of homoeopathy, which de- 
mands only the harshest criticism, is Isopathy, 
perhaps the filthiest theory ever invented, 
according to which like is to be cured by like, 
and to such an extent that smallpox is to be 
treated by variolous pus, tapeworm by the 
ingestion of the proglottides, etc. 

Another of the rankest of fraudulent out- 
growths is the so-called Electro-horn* eopathic 
:n of Count Mattei, who prates of " red," 
"blue," and "green" electricity — a theory 
that, in spite of its utter idiocy, has attracted 
a considerable following and earned a for- 
tune for its chief promoter. 

Another of the vagaries of the earlier por- 
tion of the present century, and that still 
survives in a weak way, is Cranioscopy or 
Phrenology. ( ia.ll expounded his doctrines at 
Vienna as early as 1796, but, being expelled,

went to Germany, where he was joined by 
Spurzheim, who, though much more of a 
student and scientist, accepted the doctrine 
of the former with enthusiasm; and it was 
chiefly due to the efforts of Spurzheim that 
phrenology was introduced into England, 
and later (1832) into America. Gall assumed 
to locate twenty-seven different organs along- 
side of each other in the brain, and held that 
external markings on the skull were guides 
to the development of the various parts. 
Every neophyte in anatomy knows how little 
foundation there is for such a doctrine, but 
for a time it attracted great attention, and 
there are to-day certain men and women 
who make their living out of this imposition. 
The Physiological Theory of Medicine was 
originated by Broussais (1772-1838), and 
combined the views of Pinel and Bichat with 
the "sympathetic" view of Hoffmann, the 
"concealed inflammation" of Stoll, and the 
theory of inflammation held by Marcus. 
Broussais had been a pupil of Bichat. In 
1814 he began hospital teaching, and in 1831 
was made professor. Personally very vain, 
quick-tempered, even belligerent, as a thera- 
peutist he was a man of routine. He was 
perhaps best known shortly before his death, 
when delivering lectures on phrenology. Ac- 
cording to him, life depends upon external 
irritation produced by heat, which excites 
new chemical processes, while these in turn 
stimulate regeneration, assimilation, as well 
as contractility and sensibility. When the 
functions supported by heat cease, death en- 
sues. Health depends upon moderate action 
of external irritants, disease upon either their 
weakness or their extraordinary strength. 
He saw nothing ontological about disease. 
In therapeutics he admitted the healing 
power of nature, but regarded the physician 
not as a minister but as a lord of nature. 
Febrile and inflammatory diseases were all 
treated by the withdrawal of nourishment 
carried to the extreme. His most powerful 
antiphlogistic treatment consisted in the ap- 
plication of leeches to the abdomen, and to 
robust individuals he applied from thirty to 
fifty at once. It is not, then, to be wondered 
at that in consequence of his so-called " hi- 
rudinomania " leeches became very scarce. 
In the year 1833 41,500,000 leeches were 
imported into France, while in 1824 one- 



twentieth of this number sufficed to supply 
the demand. Even in cases of worms the ab- 
dominal integument had to pay its blood trib- 
ute, particularly if enteritis prevailed. He 
only allowed a spare diet of mucilaginous 
and acid drinks. In mercurial France and 
Italy he gained numerous followers, but they 
were few and far between in practical, hard- 
headed Germany and England. His best 
follower was Bouillaud (1 797-1881), who 
adopted the symptomatic nature of fever and 
the sanguinary therapeutics of his master, 
but used the lancet more than the leech. As 
the homoeopaths regard Hahnemann, so 
Bouillaud looked up to Broussais as the Mes- 
siah of medicine and science, which, as Baas 
says, were "already greatly overstocked with 
Messiahs." 

Contemporaneous with the school of Brous- 
sais, and its antagonist in all respects, was 
the Paris School of Pathological Anatomy 
and Diagnosis, which has given tone to all 
medical art. It made it the duty of the phy- 
sician to search for changes in the human 
body, to investigate the local products of 
disease, and assigned to medicine the duty 
of removing these products. The tendency 
of its teaching was to treat the patient rather 
as a living cadaver than as a sentient being 
endowed with vital forces, and the charge 
which Asclepiades once falsely made against 
Hippocrates was revived upon new grounds. 
Kratzmann wrote some years ago : '• In France 
every one experiments on the sick, less to 
attain the best method of cure than to enrich 
science with an interesting discovery and to 
advance the accuracy of diagnosis by some 
new physical sign." The seductiveness of 
this system promoted still more one-sided- 
ness, which finally almost attained the belief 
that the science of medicine really originated 
in the Anatomical School of Pans. 

The forerunners of this school were Bichat 
and Pinel, and its proper founders were 
Corvisart, Dupuytren, and Laennec. There 
was also Bayle, who was first to apply the 
ear to the thorax in disease of the heart, and 
thus became the predecessor of Laennec and 
Chomel. He was the godfather of typhoid 
fever, and from being a famous clinician be- 
came later a great pathologist. The most 
celebrated adherent of the method, however, 
was Cruveilhier (1 791-1873), professor first

•' inflammations to which 
belong gangrene and atony, and a a 

md fevers; and endeavored 
to inv the different steps in the de- 

velopment of lesions, not simply their final 
products. His teachings concerning pyemia 
and phlebitis, which had been first studied by 
John Hunter, excited great attention, and he 
even came to the one-sided conclusion that 
'•phlebitis rules the whole of pathology." 
He was the first to observe that its suppura- 
tive form does not occur primarily, but is 
secondary to coagulation of the blood. 

The ablest representative of this school, 
and one who, perhaps, more than any other 
man, made Paris a Mecca to which foreigners 
made their pilgrimages, was Andral (1797- 
[876), the son of a physician and the most 
noted and indefatigable investigator and 
thinker of his time. Between 1823 and 1840 
were published the five volumes of his Medi- 
cal Clinic which made him famous. He 
taught, in opposition to Broussais, the exist- 
ence of primary diseases of the blood, the 
so called dyscrasia:; made physiology sub- 
servient to pathology; was the creator of the 
chemistry of the blood; and in therapeutics 
s edded to emetics and cathartics, ascrib- 
ing little importance to abstraction of blood. 
The first man to apply the Numerical 
Method to pathology, and who brought about 
the downfall of Broussais, was Louis (1787- 

. who had studied in Russia, but came 
to Paris while still a young man. He ex- 

-d his principle in the following words: 
u As often as I have formed an a priori idea 
and had afterward opportunity to prove the 
facts, I have invariably found that my idea 
was false. In pathology as well as in thera- 
peutics numerical analysis is a useful prac- 
tice. By numbers only can be obtained the 
frequency of conditions or this or that symp- 
tom; by a definite enumeration alone is it

I to .etiology, symptomatolo. 
therapeutics, and pathologn ai anatomy. 
He discarded blisters and condemned large 
. but fell into Oth( \ carrying 

his numerical method to an unjustifiable ex- 
treme. 

Next to Andral and Louis should be men- 
tioned Magendie (1783-1855), professor of 
general pathology in the College d&gt; 
and physician to the Hotel Dieu, who \\ 
representative of the new French medicine, 
and introduced experiments into both path- 
ology and physiology; he was the pioneer in 
experimental pharmaco dynamics, whit 
cupies itself largely with alkalies, a la r ge 
number of which he introduced into practice. 
He was a solid humoralist in pathology, a 
most accurate diagnostician, but (it is charged) 
" was too simple in therapeutics"! As a result 
of his intravenous injections of putrefactive 
material, he had the terms " pyaemia," " ichor- 
rhaemia" and "metastasis" introduced into 
pathology. 

Trousseau (1S01-1866), of Tours, also be- 
came professor in the Paris Faculty, rendered 
especial service in his studies of croup and 
the employment therefor of tracheotomy, 
though his chief fame rests upon his merit as 
a clinical teacher and the publication of clin- 
ical lectures which are still models in every 
way of accurate, forcible teaching. 

Claude Bernard (1813-1S78) became the 
successor of Magendie, and even more famous 
as an experimenter in pathology, physiology, 
and anatomy. Originally a poet, he finally 
turned to medicine and science, and in 1869 
became a member of the French Academy. 

One of the results of the Trench fondness 
for pathological anatomy was an outgrowth, 
unfortunate in some respects, of specialism 
which made its appearance early and spread 
to other countries, particularly to German}] 
so that to-day there is scarcely an organ in 
the body which has not only its special stu- 
dent, but its special representative in medi- 
cine. It would be of interest to go "\er 
some of the various organs and count those 
who have become most renowned in the study 
of their diseases, but time will not permit. 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 



273 



As Baas says, England, after her excessive 
participation in the iatro-chemistry and iatro- 
mechanics of the seventeenth century, with a 
devotion which extended far into the eigh- 
teenth, seemed then to lose all confidence in 
systems and schools of medicine, inasmuch as 
since that time no system or so-called school 
has gained in Great Britain any large or per- 
manent band of followers; even Brunonian- 
ism did not succeed in this respect. This 
form of conservatism is a characteristic of 
the British race. But while schools have not 
risen, individuals have formulated hypotheses 
or doctrines that at least attracted attention, 
if not followers. For instance, John Mason 
Goode (1764^1827) formulated an intricate 
nosological arrangement in his long-popular 
text-book entitled "The Study of Medicine," 
and arranged a classification of diseases now 
almost forgotten. 

In 1816 Sir Charles Bell (1774-1842) made 
the memorable discovery that the posterior 
roots of the spinal nerves preside over sensa- 
tion, and the anterior over motion; and this 
attracted anew the attention of English phy- 
sicians to the nervous system, and was re- 
warded by the later discovery of reflex action 
or reflex phenomena, communicated to the 
Royal Society in 1863 by Marshall Hall. 
Both discoveries were important, and both 
were duly rewarded by yet others. 

Benjamin Travers (1783-1858) seems to 
have been greatly influenced by the first of 
these discoveries, and led thereby to pay 
special attention to what he termed "consti- 
tutional irritation;" his studies on this sub- 
ject are often quoted to-day and are well 
worthy of perusal; he understood by this 
term a process (in strong contrast wi h inflam- 
mation) which subsides without hyperemia 
and without plastic exudate, but which on the 
other hand may occasion liquid products and 
result in neoplasms. 

Contemporaries of Travers were: Abram 
Colles; John Cheyne (1777-1830), of Dublin 
— who wrote on Diseases of Children and de- 
scribed "Cheyne-Stokes respiration;" William 
Stokes (1804-1878), also of Dublin, who dis- 
tinguished himself in 1857 by a great work 
entitled " A Treatise on the Diagnosis and 
Treatment of Diseases of the Chest;" Robert 
Graves (1797— 1853), professor of medicine in 
the King's and Queen's College, Dublin, who 



published clinical lectures of his own, besides 
many clinical reports in connection with 
Stokes. Graves was one of the first to op- 
pose the "absolute diet " of the earlier physi- 
cians in the management of febrile maladies, 
and requested that his epitaph should have 
but one line — "He fed fevers! " 

"The School of Natural Philosophy" was 
the title applied to a system which in Ger- 
many ran parallel with that of Broussais, 
being the legitimate outcome of the medical 
philosophy of the eighteenth century which 
had originated there, and also a revival of 
opposition thereto on the side of realism. It 
led into speculative extremes, which finally 
sobered down because of the meaningless 
scholastic phrases often introduced, and thus 
broke a path for the subsequent enthusiasm 
in behalf of French positivism in medicine. 
Those who constituted this school were for 
the most part men of importance, but were 
followed by a number of imbecile representa- 
tives. Use was made of the abstract doctrine 
of the philosophy of identity and the im- 
ponderables, such as electricity, mechanical 
forces, and magnetism, contrasted with which 
were the dimensions of matter and certain 
qualities like sensibility, irritability, etc. Per- 
haps the greatest influence of this teach- 
ing was in the department of embryology 
and physiology, where Johannes Miiller dis- 
played his remarkable activity. Among the 
most distinguished representatives of the 
natural-philosophy school was Oken (1779- 
185 1), of Bavaria, who subsequently taught 
in Munich, Jena, and Zurich, and published 
a large work on natural history which did 
much for the popularization of this science: 
he explained that the skub is made up from 
a series of vertebrae; also discovered the 
Wolffian bodies, and was such a power in his 
way that Agassiz characterized him not only 
as "a master in the art of teaching," but as 
"a courageous and ruling spirit." Others of 
this school were: Von Walther (1 782-1849), 
eminent as a surgeon; Dollinger (1770-1741), 
of Bamberg, the distinguished leader of the 
Old Catholics; Reil and Prochaska, anato- 
mists; Troxler and Schelling, philosophers 
and anatomists; Treviranus, the microscopist; 
Malfatti, Kilian, Spindler, Schmidt of Vienna, 
and others too numerous to mention.

- of the one-sided, ideal, systematizing 
tendei the eighteenth century (whose 
final outcome was natural philosophy), and 
to square itself with the realism and positiv- 
ism of the nineteenth. 

Schonlein (1763-1874). of Bamberg, out- 
lined a system that taught pathological and 
anatomical revelations as concrete expres- 
sions of the independent entity disease, whose 
relation to the organism is as that of a parasite 
sojourning temporarily in it; he also con- 
structed a classification of diseases, some- 
thing after the manner of the botanical 
classification of De Candolle. One of his 
best known pupils was Canstadt (1S07-1S50), 

- Jahresbericht has preserved his name. 
Siebert,*of Jena, famous as a diagnostician, 
and Haeser, the medical historian, belonged 
to this school. 

An offshoot of the French school of path- 
ological anatomy and diagnosis was the so- 
called New Vienna School, which aided the 
French system in obtaining high recognition 
in German medicine, and gained its first in- 
fluence from the labors of Wunderlich ( 1 
1857);^ next to whom should be mentioned 
Baron Yon Rokitansky (1 804-1 878), a Bo- 
hemian, one of the most famous men in 
modern times, and who exercised a profound 
influence even in foreign countries, particu- 
larly in Italy and Russia, Von Rokitansky 
worked for a long time in miserable quarters 
in Vienna, but finally a magnificent building 
was specially erected for him. He w is 
loaded with honors, and took his seat in the 



e of 1 &gt;e[ 
well known in medicin* more 

potation as singers—.. 
CUmstance which the father embodied in the 
of his sons howled and 
two of them healed." He transplanted into 
Vienna the tendency of the earliest path- 
ologico-anatomical school, which capt . 
all by its novelty and interest, and in the 
post-mortem room and the clinical-lecture 
room he converted medicine in Germany to 
the realism of the nineteenth century. He 
ndeed the Van Swieteo of Austria in 
his influence upon educational affairs. His 
works are distinguished by simplicity, clear- 
and logical order. He performed more 
than thirty thousand autopsies; for fourteen 
years studied the defects of the septum of 
the heart and the comparative anatomy of 
the uterus and i^enito-urinary organs, yet 
paid little attention to the microscope or to 
applied medicine. He was a pathologist 
pure and simple. 

A friend and co-laborer, Skoda (1S03-1 
also a Bohemian, was little if any less famous. 
In 1839 he gave to the world his famous work 
on Auscultation and Percussion; in 1S47 be- 
came professor at Prague, and was the first 
man to lecture in German. In spite of his 
bachelor peculiarities, his taciturnity, and his 
heedlessness, he was very popular and left a 
fortune, quite in contrast to Rokitansky, who 
died poor. His scientific merit was based 
upon the fact that he overthrew the specific 
and pathognomonic arrangement of sounds as 
taught by the French, and substituted there- 
for a category based upon the physical con- 
stitution and shape of organs and tissues. 
He endeavored to develop a strictly scientific 
system of physics out of the empirical French 
doctrine of physical signs, and in his work on 
Physical Diagnosis he displayed an independ- 
ent spirit, though as one who had received 
his impulse from France. He was the first 
in Germany to insist upon the merits of 
Avenbrugger, and was the leading diagnosti- 
cian of his time of the new Vienna school.

HYSTERIA, DUE TO ADHESIONS OF 
CLITORIS.* 

BY DOCTOR G. G. GORDON. 

The clitoris, though an organ of very 
modest dimensions, seems capable of, at 
times, inducing a train of exceedingly dis- 
agreeable and annoying symptoms. As a 
source of suffering it seems to have received 
little attention from pathologists, while anat- 
omists and physiologists treat of it very 
briefly. 

In September last I was called to a young 
lady, twenty-two years of age, suffering from 
an attack of hysteria. She was not violent, 
but evincing alternate attacks of laughter 
and crying, and resolutely refusing to allow 
any one to touch her; her mother declared 
that if interfered with she became worse, and 
frequently passed into an unconscious or 
semi-conscious condition, simulating cata- 
lepsy, but really ecstatic, which might persist 
for an hour or more. At this time I expe- 
rienced no difficulty in affording relief, and 
left the patient in a comfortable condition. 

Summoned again the following day, I found 
her ecstatic, and the unconscious condition 
was with difficulty overcome. I now ques- 
tioned the mother as to general health, dispo- 
sition, and habits, hoping to educe some 
data whereby the cause of these attacks could 
be made evident. It seems they began almost 
simultaneously with establishment of the 
menses — had existed, in fact, since her six- 
teenth year. The monthly flow was regular 
and normal, so far as could be determined, 
but the young woman about the time of pu- 
berty received a severe mental shock through 
an attempt to abduct her — an attempt that 
failed and apparently induced no worse in-

jury than fright. She was disinclined to go 
out into society, of rather irritable disposition, 
and at times quite willful and perverse. Her 
associates had always been of good character, 
and she kept good hours, etc. 

I suspected, from certain remarks, coupled 
with peculiarities of the patient, that she 
might be addicted to masturbation; but the 
mother considered this impossible, as she 
had early warned her daughter against the 
vice, and had always found her most truth- 
ful; she admitted, however, the girl had been 
inducted into the habit during her tenth year r 
having been taught it by girls at school, but 
it had been abandoned owing to the sensible 
measure of the parent. Later I had an op- 
portunity to question the girl herself, who 
spoke frankly and apparently without any 
reservation. She denied masturbation, ex- 
cept during her tenth year as just noted; 
referred her difficulty to some trouble about 
the vulva, which had persisted since early 
girlhood, and possibly might have arisen 
from an accident she described as having in- 
jured her severely — while attempting to walk 
a fence, she fell astride on an inch board. 
It was impossible for her to ride a bicycle, 
and even the motion of a street-car was 
sometimes so irritating that she was obliged 
to leave the vehicle lest she should have one 
of her "fainting" (ecstatic) seizures. The 
sensation induced was referred to as one of 
pain, though I was also able to elicit evidence 
that at times it was accompanied by orgasm. 

I still believed her the victim of vice, but 
was forced to admit she did not shrink from 
discussing the subject, in the way usual to 
such unfortunates. Neither did she object 
greatly to digital examination, but rather 
expressed a willingness to submit to anything 
within reason that would afford assurance of 
relief, as the condition was very annoying 
even when it did not induce the ecstatic state, 
and debarred her from social privileges, since 
excitement either of pleasure or anger was 
often sufficient to bring on a "spell." 

On making examination of the external 
genitals, with an attempt to separate the labia 
majora, I was cautioned to be very careful 
lest pain be induced, which I now found was 
referred to the vicinity of the clitoris. Next 
it was discovered the labia minora were 
firmly adherent to this organ and almost

recurrence of her troubles 
for a number of days she demanded a 

deal of care, and her ecstatic per Is were 
more frequent and more prolonged. 

After the patient had somewhat regained, 
her normal condition, with the assistance of 
Doctor Sprague and an anaesthetic I loosened 

- between the clitoris and 

labia. From this time out I was gratified to 

rapid and permanent improvement that 

has : up to the present. The patient 

expresses herself as now feeling "perfectly 

well:" she rides a wheel, goes into society, 

10 evidences of hysteria whatever, and 

ems quite another person. It is 

perhaps unnecessary to say that I no longer 

hold the opinion that she was addicted to 

masturbation. 

And thus a seemingly trivial operation has 
restored this patient from a condition of 
almost constant torture to one as comfortable 
as that enjoyed by any one of her associates. 

Now the query which is uppermost in my 
min 1 is: How common are these cases? Was 
this a rare one ? We naturally look for anal- 
ogous conditions in boys; therefore does it 
not behoove the practitioner to be more par- 
ticular and likewise suspect them in girls ? I 
am now inclined to believe I have overlooked 
this condition in several of my female pa- 
tients. I have also observed that adhesions 
of the same nature are by no means markedly 
uncommon among married women. Does 
the marital state tend in any way to alleviate 
or mask the symptoms in such cases ?

COCAINE INEBRIETN . 

It is but recently that this form of narco- 
mania has found place in our nosology — so 
recently, in fact, that the profession at large 
are very much at sea regarding it, since reli- 
able reports are few and far between, and the 
habit is very likely to be complicated with 
some other, such as the taking of morphine, 
excessive indulgence in alcohol, etc. 

Doctor Norman Kerr, who easily stands 
foremost among authorities on inebriety and 
narcomania, in his latest work mentions for 
the first time the Cocaine habit, remarking ^« 
passant that in his experience it is compara- 
tively rare and for the most part confined to 
members of the medical profession. Per 
contra, a recent writer in the Bulletin of 
Pharmacy* writing from the standpoint of a 
pharmacist, seems to imagine the habit is 
much more widespread than has heretofore 
been considered, that it is continually in- 
creasing, and that its growing prevalence is 
largely due to the greatly reduced price of 
the drug. He also remarks that it is a per- 
nicious habit among a certain class of phar- 
macists to offer "Cocaine when asked for 
something that will relieve toothache, neural- 
gia, and countless other aches and pains; 
that in some way the erroneous notion has 
come to prevail that in treating the mor- 
phine habit Cocaine is of great value in 
counteracting the effects of the former drug." 
'• Proceeding on this principle, numerous 
quacks have claimed ability to cure the

morphine habit, . . . but in its stead the 
patients become cursed with a vice far more 
ruinous than all their former ills. . . . 
To use Cocaine to cure the morphine habit is 
like jumping from the frying-pan into the 
fire." 

Certain it is, the Cocaine habit is the most 
seductive and terrible form of inebriety — the 
pleasant elation which the drug induces, and 
the apparent absence of unpleasant sequelae 
that accrue to other forms of narcomania, 
lead to rapid destruction of the mental powers. 
Numerous cases of fatal poisoning by Cocaine 
have been reported in current medical litera- 
ture, but the number of known Cocaine 
habitues is very few — perhaps because un- 
recognized or, as before mentioned, compli- 
cated with some other form of chronic intox- 
ication. 

If it is true that both the medical and phar- 
maceutical professions are responsible for the 
spread of the Cocaine habit, owing to the 
freedom with which this most potent and 
treacherous narcotic has been prescribed for 
the relief of pain, it is certainly imperative 
that there be thrown about the sale of this 
drug restrictions which alone can be formu- 
lated and carried out by these professions, 
without any reference whatever to measures 
employed by the State. 

That many of the victims are themselves 
medical men, is undoubtedly true; the re- 
mainder are for the most part made up of 
women and litterateurs. Doubtless pain has 
recurred after the soothing effect of the 
first use of the drug has passed away, and 
the same handy and charmed remedy is 
again had recourse to without any knowl- 
edge of the results that are certain and 
swift to appear. Thus the craving, be- 
side which the fascination of morphine and 
opium is infinitesimal, has been acquired, 
and the victim awakes to the fact that he or 
she has become bound fast to a habit entirely 
unsuspected. In a few cases there is evi- 
dence that herculean effort and iron will have 
succeeded in effecting a deliverance, but un- 
fortunately such instances are most rare. 

It would appear also that in some instances 
the Cocaine habit has been acquired through 
the ignorant employment of a prescription 
by the physician as a succedaneum to opium 
or morphine, or for the relief of some teasing 



malady like vaso-motor coryza (hay fever). 
Nothing can be more disastrous than the 
substitution of Cocaine for some other drug, 
since it is considerably more speedy than 
any other narcotic in displaying its char- 
acteristic effects, and quicker in securing an 
abiding mastery over the taker; the stage 
of exhilaration being more pleasant than 
that of morphine or opium, the drug is on 
this account also correspondingly more dan- 
gerous. Inebriates may indulge to most per- 
nicious extremes in strong spirits for years 
without apparent mischief; some are even 
able to carry morphine narcomania to almost 
incredible lengths ere the drug manifests 
its deleterious qualities upon the physical and 
mental organism; but, per contra, the mental 
decay and moral perversion of Cocaine ex- 
cess quickly appear and as speedily increase 
in intensity. In some instances where the 
drug has been employed subcutaneously sev- 
eral times daily, an insane condition has 
developed leading to crime and to suicide; 
indeed, the Cocaine habitue is always insane, 
and not infrequently a "raving maniac." 
There is also, under the influence of this 
drug, less sense of time than from any other 
narcotic, though all substances possessed of 
anaesthetic properties seem to have a disturb- 
ing effect on the mental capacity. 

While Cocaine raises the temperature, its 
effects are much more swift and short-lived 
than those of morphine, while its tendency, 
in excess, is always toward delirium and 
raving madness. In fatal cases stupor and 
coma follow, with convulsions and paralysis 
of respiration — or, as Mosso and Kerr put it, 
"tetanus of the respiratory muscles." 

That Cocaine acts chiefly upon the central 
nervous system, first stimulating and then 
paralyzing, is manifest; it contracts the pe- 
ripheral blood-vessels. Under its use there 
is at first, usually, increased mental and 
bodily vigor, which speedily gives way to in- 
tense mental depression along with anorexia, 
insanity, hallucinations, and complete break- 
ing-down of the mind, with volitional palsy 
and inhibitory prostration, all taking place in 
a much shorter time than the mental degen- 
eration and physical decadence of alcoholism 
— in fact, demanding in many cases only as 
many weeks as alcohol inebriety requires 
years.

lect and conscience of man." (Kerr.) 

The drug is usually taken subcutaneouslv, 
and the doses frequently follow one another 
in rapid succession. Taken, as it doubtless 
frequently is, along with or after some other 
narcotic, it greatly complicates any attempt 
at alleviation of the latter. Doctor Mattison, 
of Brooklyn, has reported a number of inter- 
esting cases, as have likewise Erlenmeyer, 
Kerr, Connolly, Norman, and others, and all 
unite in the opinion that if taken in time the 
incipient form of Cocaine inebriety is quite 
easily relieved, but that the habit once con- 
firmed is most intractable. Kerr declares 
one of his cases consumed thirty grains of 
Cocaine daily; the writer personally knows 
of an instance where three times this amount 
of the drug was daily consumed; and yet one- 
seventh of a grain has been known to prove 
fatal to a stout, healthy man. 

A.S regards treatment, there can be no dis- 
pute. It must be both mental and physical, 
and, like the treatment of all habits, is sel- 
dom of any utility except when carried on 
under complete and definite restraint. 



THE DISCOVERY OF HELIUM. 

At the annual meeting of the Royal Chem- 
ety, Professor Ramsay announced 
that in his endeavors to discover a compound 
of argon he had experimented with a rare 
earth, said to yield nitrogen when acted upon 
by sulphuric acid. Instead of nitrogen, argon 
was evolved, but associated with it was some 
strange gas that turned out to be Helium, the 
lightest of all the possible elements, whose 



Hi from the dems 
ical theory, had only been inferred from the 
solar spectrum, h is the first of all the ele- 
ments, for below this comes the hypoth- 
"protyle " — that preelementary cosmic stuff 
from which all the elemeir pposed to 

have ised. 

though this small quantity of helium was 
so recently found, its existence has already 
been confirmed by Professor I . who 

identified its spectrum. A more remarkable 
vindication of chemical theories than this it 
would be difficult to find, since the hypo- 
thetical or celestial helium wris first detected 
twenty-seven years ago by Messrs. Norman 
Lockyer and Frankland in the course of a 
spectroscopical examination of some tongues 
of tlaming gas that became apparent during 
a complete solar eclipse. These spurts of 
flame were often 100,000 miles in length, and 
were shown to consist mainly of glowing 
hydrogen and an unknown substance. 

The terrestrial helium found in the Swedish 
mineral cleueite was discovered as a variety of 
uranimite, containing uranium, lead, and some 
of the rarer earths. It is not a little curious 
that Professor Ramsay should have discov- 
ered both of the new elements, argon and 
helium, side by side in cleveite. Altogether, 
England may congratulate herself upon the 
two most brilliant discoveries that have been 
made of late years in the most exact and 
progressive of sciences, modern chemistry. 



"BESIDE THE BONNIE BRIAR BUSH." 

A work of which in a few weeks 50,000 
copies have been issued, can hardly fail to 
have secured many medical readers; and 
those who have not perused Ian Maclaren's 
superlatively interesting volume should not 
fail to do so. Full of tender pathos and rich 
character-sketches, such a book as this 
continue when present-day novels shall have 
been consigned to everlasting oblivion. 

For the depiction of William MacLure, a 
Scotch practitioner, a man blunt in manner 
but ready in resources, and getting little or 
no pay beyond the gratitude of the poor glen 
folk, the medical profession are under great 
obligations to the author. Appreciative is 
the testimony rendered to a member of the 
section of our profession which is, perhaps,

the hardest worked and most ill requited in 
cash. There are many word-pictures of the 
life of this interesting man who "did his best 
for the need of every man, woman and child 
in this wild, straggling district, year in and 
year out, in the snow and in the heat, in the 
dark and in the light, without rest, and with- 
out a holiday for forty years." 

The graphic description, of the treatment 
of pyrexia by cold baths is particularly fine, 
as well as the account given of the subse- 
[ quent delight of the good doctor at the re- 
covery of his patient. 

No medical man possessed of a soul can 
read this work without being made better 
morally, mentally, and professionally.

EDITORIAL NOTES. 



Medicine. — 

This is the title of a new medical monthly 
magazine that has made its appearance upon 
our exchange table, and which we most 
heartily welcome. It is the result of the en- 
terprise of Mr. Geo. S. Davis, the well known 
medical publisher, ably seconded editorially 
by Doctor Harold N. Moyer, of Chicago, and 
i staff of expert collaborators and contribu- 
:ors, representing the foremost and best 
medical talent of the Northwest. Medicine, 
moreover, is representative of no college, 
:lique, publishing house, or manufacturing 
concern, but is merely a high-class cosmo- 
Dolitan medical publication. Such names as

:&gt;. H. Weaver, H. T. Patrick, M. D. Ewell, 



Henry Gradle and Norman Bridge associated 
therewith give abundant assurance of char- 
acter for the future. The April number pre- 
sents original articles on "Herpes Zoster 
Gangrenosus," "Sarcoma of the Kidney in 
Children," "Cardiac Sedatives," "Prostatic 
Tuberculosis," "Medical Septicaemia," and 
" Effects of La Grippe on the Nose, Throat, 
and Ear." A notable innovation, one we 
heartily commend, is the absence of "editori- 
als," since it is to be presumed the editor will 
give expression to his opinions in direct per- 
sonal contributions. 

A journal of such complete independence 
and high literary standing as Medicine has 
long been needed. 

Strychnine and Snake Poison.— 

Surgeon-Captain R. H. Elliot, of the East 
Indian Medical Service, has recently reinvesti- 
gated the value of Strychnine as an antidote 
against snake poison in the most thorough 
manner, and corroborates the inefficiency of 
the drug. He experimented not alone with 
the cobra, but with the venom of that much 
more dangerous reptile, the Daboii Russelli 
(or tic paloonga), and also with that of the 
krait, employing frogs, lizards, ducks, fowls, 
hares, guinea-pigs, dogs, goats, pigs, and 
monkeys. The results accruing to the in- 
vestigations of Surgeons D. D. Cunningham 
and A. A. Kanthack, indicating that Strych- 
nine is in no sense an antidote against snake 
poison, are fully upheld. 

In view of the physiological problems 
which present themselves and practically 
block any possibility of an antidote being 
discovered, the conclusion arrived at by 
Doctor Elliot was one already foregone. 
The problem is to rehabilitate disintegrated 
blood-corpuscles, and when this can be accom- 
plished it will be possible to create life anew. 
The real problem has already been discussed 
in the editorial columns of The Medical 
Age (1895, page 145).

Lost ! — 

More than a year ago the Amick Consump- 
tion Cure Company brought suit against 
Doctor J. R. Reeves, of Chattanooga, for 
publicly exposing what he claimed to be the 
fraudulent character of their business. This 
suit has just been tried in a court of record, 
and the jury in less than two hours rendered 
a verdict in favor of the defendant, the costs 
being taxed upon the plaintiff. 

The Thermometer.— 

A correspondent of the New York Medical 
Times speaks very disparagingly of the clin- 
ical thermometer, a circumstance that brings 
to mind the fact that in Joseph Price's hos- 
pital in Philadelphia the thermometer is 
never used. 

It is notorious that this instrument is often 
a factor for evil — that too many practitioners 
treat the thermometer instead of the patient. 

A Suggestive Error.— 

of our contemporaries, speaking of the 
city that is its home and birthplace, strangely 
announces that its " morality in the past year 
has been less than one per thousand." Hard

The profession of medicine is one of sacri- 
fice, and he who is not prepared to make it 
would do well to turn his attention to some- 
thing else.

Worth Investigating.— 

We have been informed, on good authorit} 
of a practice pursued by one manufacturer ii 
the making of tablets of the so-called narcotic 
tinctures (i.e., aconite, belladonna, digitals 
etc.), which, if true, is open to the sc 
censure. This manufacturer, finding that his 
tablets of these tinctures stuck together on 
keeping in stock, adopted a new procedure. 
Instead of making the tablets contain the 
tincture in minims, as represented, he makes 
a fluid extract of the drug, evaporates to a 
thick consistency, washes with petroleum ben- 
zin to remove resin, coloring matter, and 
benzin-soluble extractive, spreads on plates, 
dries with heat, and makes up into tabl&lt; 

Now, apart from the question as to whether 
this benzin treatment removes or alters any 
active principles or not, the fact remains that

such tablets are not what they are represented 
to be. Instead of being made of tinctures, 
as claimed, they are made of fluid extracts, 
concentrated by heat, washed with a solvent 
that removes certain proximate principles, 
and then heated to eliminate the persistently 
remaining traces of benzin, which heat prob- 
ably modifies, if it does not destroy, the 
rem lining proximate constituents. — Philadel- 
phia College of Pharmacy Alumni Journal. 

Opium in Gynaecology.— 

The medical profession has always been 
responsible for the opium habit of patients 
or the laity, by its reckless and indiscriminate 
iprescription of anodynes and narcotics — 
generally used for the treatment of symp- 
toms; rarely does the routine practitioner 
make a precise diagnosis before giving 
lopium, if pain is present. Opiates are com- 
monly used without a clear recognition of an 
[indication except that of pain. The opium 
jiabit is rarely acquired, except it be ante- 
dated by pain or an illness for which some 
tfioctor has given morphine or some prepara- 
ion of opium. There is scarcely a remedy 
n the Pharmacopoeia used so recklessly and 
ignorantly, and none doing more general 
mischief — it has always done thrice as much 
larm as good. In the general practice of 
,nedicine, some of the preparations of opium 
ire to be found in about every prescription. 
; The hypodermatic syringe has made thous- 
ands of morphine habitues, either with the 
, yringe or with the powder alone. The abuse 
f the drug is much more common in some 
states than in others. The influence or im- 
ress of certain teachers of therapeutics has 
i ;een wide in certain sections. The very 
ommon remark of teachers, " Gentlemen, 
; is your mission to relieve pain and suffer- 
lg," has done a world of mischief. Many 
f them spend days talking over the numer- 
ous preparations of opium, without an allu- 
' on to the importance of an accurate knowl- 
ige of pathology and diagnosis. — Doctor 
-oseph Price, in the Quarterly Jour?ial of 
mnefrriety. 

he Criminal Use of Chloral.— 

; We have from time to time adverted on 
te necessity for some general legislation to 
'event criminals from purchasing deadly 
rugs, and recently the use of chloral by 
{ iminals for criminal ends was made the 

• ibject of an investigation by the captain of 
at notorious New York precinct called 

I The Tenderloin." Having been informed 
fiat the so called ■" knock-out drops" (that 

• live the name of completing the work of 
fcicohol in the operations of thieves who desire 



to stupefy and afterward clean out their par- 
tially intoxicated victims) contain chloral, 
Captain Pickett sent out a detective to inves- 
tigate the sale of chloral and other stupefy- 
ing drugs, and found that it is altogether too 
easy to purchase. He is inclined to regard 
the law relating to the purchase and posses- 
sion of poisons as a weak one, as it does not 
provide for the detention or punishment of 
persons having the "knock-out drops" in 
possession, who may have been arrested on 
suspicion. He states that the offense is grave 
enough to make it a felony to the person on 
whom is found the drug for any unlawful 
purpose. The druggists who sold chloral 
indiscriminately to the detective will be pros- 
ecuted. A case of death has recently been 
held to be referable to these "knock-out 
drops." — Journal of the American Medical 
Association. 

The Pasteur Institute and Rabies. — 

Without entering into any discussion of 
statistics of cures obtained by the "Pasteur 
Institute" — cures that can always be con- 
tested, since it cannot be proved with cer- 
tainty that the subject bitten would in any 
case have had hydrophobia — it is only too 
certain that the anti-rabic inoculations have 
induced death in many subjects, with special 
symptoms that have caused such deaths to 
be designated by the names of paralytic rage 
or hydrophobia of the laboratory. Without 
taking part either for or against the anti- 
rabic theories of Pasteur, one cannot deny 
that his unfortunate want of success demon- 
strates that such injections are not absolutely 
inoffensive. While we may appreciate the re- 
sults obtained, no one can affirm that they may 
not produce others farther remote; we know, 
too, that the origin of these may also be con- 
tested. — Journal de M/decine de Paris. 

His Parting Benediction.— 

A country minister in a certain locality took 
permanent leave of his congregation in the 
following pathetic manner: " Brothers and 
sisters, I come to say good-by. I don't think 
God loves this church, because none of you 
ever die. I don't think you love each other, 
because I never marry any of you. I don't 
think you love me, because you have not 
paid my salary; your donations are mouldy 
fruit and wormy apples; and ' by their fruit ye 
shall know them.' Brothers, I am going away 
to a better place. I have been called to be 
chaplain of a penitentiary. Where I go ye 
cannot come, but I go to prepare a place for 
you, and may the Lord have mercy on your 
souls. Good-by." — Ranis Horn.

toxins, especially on the circulator} 
on this indication cardiac and nervine tonicsl 
.should be administered: 

-Toying the germs of the disease, whichl 
embraces local measure-. — As a solvent of thej 
membrane and to promote healthy granulation 
of the surface, lactic acid probably stands 
first. Sesquichloride of iron has long held a 
prominent though empirical position 
local application; it forms the basis of I 
Loeffler's solution, which he recommei 
a local application. In ninety-six cases! 
wherein the remedy was employed, not aj 
single death occurred: 

Sustaining the vital powers by stimulants,' 
for which purpose alcohol must be given with 1 
no stinting hand. 

Post-nasal and nasal diphtheria should be: 
treated on the same lines. When the mem- 
brane extends to the larynx, a moist atmos-&lt; 
phere is beneficial; but the confinement of 
patient in a continuous vapor bath, such 
the croup tent constitutes, is much to bel 
deprecated on account of its prostrating 
effects. 

Hypertrophied tonsils, cedematous uvuh 
and adenoid growths in the nasopharynx, 
frequent concomitants of diphtheria, shoul 
be removed, if appearing responsible for ot 
structed respiration. By this means, moi 
severe operations (as tracheotomy) may 
prevented, and this not only without risk, but 
on the contrary, with every benefit. 

Originating in 1852 with Bouchut, who was 
also the first apostle of intubation, this 
cedure fell into disuse, and when I report&lt; 
a case in 1878 it was treated with the 
opposition as on its first adoption. It h; 
since received the support of many eminet 
practitioners. — Doctor Lennox Bf 
in Medical Press and Circular.

sided, but the pulse remained rapid. Reason- 
ing from previous experiences, the prognosis 
was considered unfavorable. After the som- 
nolence had lasted ten days, it was decided, 
on account of the low temperature and fre- 
quent and small pulse, to employ hot baths. 
He received during three days twelve baths 
in all, at 104 F., each of ten minutes' dura- 
tion, and even after the first bath striking 
improvement was observed. Gradually the 
sensorium cleared up, pain and opisthotonos 
diminished, incontinence of urine and faeces 
disappeared, the abducens nerve assumed its 
normal function, and the power of speech 
returned. Upon discontinuing the treatment, 
nocturnal headache and delirium reappeared, 
whereupon three more baths were given, 
after which all symptoms of disease vanished. 
I report this to encourage the further trial of 
hot water. — Doctor Aufecht, in Die der 
Gagenwart. 

Cocaine Injections for Enlarged Prostate. — 
For many years the difficulty of enlarged 
prostate has been to me one of considerable 
mportance. Castration is probably the least 
desirable operation in operative surgery — not 
because of the difficulties or dangers present 
n the removal of the testicles, but because 
)f the destruction of the virilitv of the in- 
dividual concerned. While in search for a 
•emedy short of absolute castration I devised 
1 method that has so far succeeded in two 
:ases; this is, to inject cocaine directly into 
he testicle twice per week for about two 
nonths. There is considerable absorption, 
xnd spermatozoa cease to be produced in 
ibout six weeks. The patient gets immedi- 
.te relief from the distressing symptoms of 
&gt;rostatitis and enlargement; the gland gradu- 
.lly shrinks to its normal size; and the finale 
i '»f the case is recovery, with the power of 
opulation but absolute cessation of the pro- 
uction of spermatozoa. Is not this better, 
nan castration? — Doctor S. E. McCully, 
1 Medical Record. 



Tubercular Meningitis. — Death in tubercu- 
ir meningitis is caused not by the develop- 
lent of the tubercles, but by intracranial 
impression, by cerebral asphyxia. The ra- 
onal treatment of the disease lies, therefore, 
1 trephining and drainage — procedures sim- 
ar to those employed with good results in 
ibercular peritonitis; the operation should, 
^wever, be performed before coma sets in. 
rd and Waterhouse report a case of tuber- 
ilar meningitis in a child five years old, in 
ihich trephination of the occiput was done 
x weeks after the onset of the disease. The 



dura and arachnoid were divided, and a probe 
and drainage-tube introduced between the 
cerebellum and the medulla oblongata. The 
drainage was followed by an amelioration of 
the severe symptoms. In spite of the fact 
that the tube was kept in situ for seventeen 
days, and an intercurrent attack of measles 
developed, the child got. well. — Doctor 
Hirschberg, in Bulletin Gene'ral de The'ra- 
peutique. 

Mental Therapeutics. — The therapeutic in- 
fluence of credulity raises a not unimportant 
question in medical practice — namely, how 
far it is justifiable for the practitioner to go 
in certain cases in conscious deception of the 
patient. It may be said that the end to be 
obtained justifies the adoption of any and 
every means that can be brought to bear; but 
the matter has another side to it. A blind 
belief in the powers of medical art has been 
transmitted from the days when magic and 
medicine were almost synonymous terms; 
and it is questionable whether it is really jus- 
tifiable to encourage this kind of belief. It 
is doubtless more difficult often to strengthen 
the will power of certain invalids than to yield 
to their credulity, but there can be no two 
opinions as to which line of action would be 
of most value to their mental health. — Medi- 
cal Record. 



Creosote in Phthisis. — In Creosote we have 
a remedy productive of much good or a sub- 
stance utterly worthless and even harmful. 
To-day it is the one, and to morrow it is the 
other; but, as a rule, in either instance it is 
the physician or pharmacist and not the rem- 
edy that is at fault. Pure Creosote, properly 
and systematically administered, is without 
doubt one of the most reliable and standard 
remedies in the entire Pharmacopoeia; and 
failure in its use is due to non-employment 
of a reliable product, or neglect to prescribe 
a proper method of administration. A pure 
beechwood Creosote administered in a proper 
way, as a rule, gives most successful results. 
— Doctor C. W. Ingraham, in Medical News. 



Belladonna for Cancer. — A woman, aged 
fifty, with a swelling in the right breast, which 
had been noticed for six months and was in- 
creasing in size, applied at the Birmingham 
Hospital. The tumor was hard but movable, 
situated below the nipple, which was unmis- 
takably retracted. Glands not enlarged, but 
much pain down right arm. It was decided 
the growth was cancerous, and that the breast 
should be removed. Preparatory to the oper- 
ation, Belladonna was ordered internally, and,

it is not being digested at all. It is best re- 
placed by white of egg beaten up and largely 
diluted with water; in this way can be intro- 
duced any requisite amount of real food, and 
in the blandest and most readily digestible 
form; it leaves no solid residue, and can cause

Ephedra Vulgaris. — Doctor Vestenrijka has

very little diuretic power, and in very small

Oxalic Acid as an Emmenagogue. — Doctor 
Baldy declares this drug, like all others, has

to induce abortion; it is therefore necessary 
to discriminate the class of cases in which 
it is to be employed — it is justifiable to pre- 
scribe only when possibility of pregnancy has 
been absolutely excluded. — PJiiladclphia Poly-

Medical Progress, 



On a Delivery-Pan in Use at the Pres- 
j ent Time in Spain.* — The writings of Ploss 
and Witkowsky, and the researches of Doc- 
tors Engelmann and Felkin, have shown that 
a remarkable diversity of practice has pre- 
vailed among different races and at different 
:epochs in regard to the position assumed by 
ithe parturient woman, and the provision that 
is made for her comfort. 

In the second volume of the latest work of 
Ploss, edited by G. Bartels, eight different 
labor positions are tabulated, with the regions 
jjand races where they are respectively adopt- 
ed: these are: Lying: Half-lying or leaning 
[[backwards: Sitting: Squatting: Kneeling: 
[[Standing: Hanging: Swinging. 

Of the provisions made for parturient women 

&gt;.n the sitting posture, the most widely diffused 

[was some kind of stool or chair, and many 

Imminent accoucheurs expended much ingenu- 

ty in its construction. Kilian gives a list 

| )f thirty-one different authors whose names 

ire associated with birth-chairs of various 

i "orm. Perhaps the most famous of these is 

:he Deventer Chair, regarding which Schroe- 

ler tells us that every well plenished bride in 

Holland was expected to have one as part of 

ler trousseau. 

Deventer himself devotes several pages to 
he description and mode of use of his de- 
. ivery-chair, and concludes: 
1 "From all that hath been said, it is easy to 
• udge how useful a chair well fitted is for 
hild-bearing; but on the contrary, if ill con- 
rived, only a troublesome lumber, scarce fit 
i or any other use than to burn. This whole 
hair, with the four doors, and another seat 
' 'Ut into a sack, may easily be carried by any 
ian, and is therefore by no means too heavy 
3T the use of cities and towns; and it is a 
ling to be wished for, that every midwife 
r ere furnished with such a chair; and who- 
ver cannot take the proportion from the 
gure, they may come to my house and see 
ly chair, if a workman can make them one 
V mine." 

Moschion, among the requisites of the 
r ing-in room, reckons a " sedile obstetricium, 
athedrce simile," and asks, in Cap. xviii, 
:cording to his Latin editor Devez, " Quale 
t sedile obstetricium?" and answers, "Consu- 
n sedi simile, in quo sic sedet, ut sub sexu habeat 
jramen in lunce formam exeissum, ut iliac 
jetus excidere possit. ' ' 



*Communicated to the Edinburgh Obstetrical 
ciety, December 12th, 1894, by A. R. Simpson, 



One seems to hear an echo of the ancient 
author in the earliest work that was published 
for the instruction of midwives in England, 
"The Birth of Mankinde" by Raynal-de, who 
says: 

"Now when the woman purceyveth the 
matrix or mother to waxe laxe or loose and 
to be dissolved and that the humors issue 
foorth in great plentie, then it shall be meete 
for her to sit t downe, leaning backeward in 
manner upright; for which purpose in some 
regions (as in Fraunce and Germanie) the 
midwives have stooles for the nonce, which 
being but lowe, and not high for the ground, 
be made so compassewise and cave or hollowe 
in the middle, that that may be received from 
underneth which is looked for, and the back 
of the stoole, leaning backeward, receiveth 
the back of the woman." 

The chair sometimes belonged to an insti- 
tution; and there may still be seen in the 
Obstetric Museum of Edinburgh University 
the labor-chair that was in use last century 
in the room with six beds in the top story of 
the Old Infirmary, that was assigned to Pro- 
fessor Young as an obstetric ward. Some- 
times the chair was portable and provided by 
the doctor; such a chair, answering to Mos- 
chion's description, was used in Malta a gen- 
eration ago. One was sent to Sir James»Y. 
Simpson by Doctor Pisani, whose father had 
employed it in his practice. Raynalde's sen- 
tence, which is simply a translation from 
Roesslin's work, indicates that in France and 
Germany it was the midwife who owned the 
birth-stool; whilst in Holland, as appears 
from the remark I have quoted from Schroe- 
der, it was part of the patient's own furniture. 

But whilst many authorities are vaunting 
the value of such chairs, already in the 
seventeenth century Eckarth is found, as 
Ploss tells us, inveighing against them in 
these terms: * 

"When one looks at the construction of 
an agony chair, you see it is a real chair of 
pain and instrument of torture. When the 
sufferer should have her best rest, there is a 
ledge three or, in special cases, four fingers 
broad; it is little wonder that these poor 
people break in bits their loins and backs, 
and faint from the severity of the sufferings. 
O ! cursed contrivance, I say, the infernal 
Proserpina was the inventor of it." 

Although seats of various fashions have 
been described as of wide and long-continued 
use, I find no mention made of a utensil 
which is sold in the china merchants' shops 
in Spain, and used as a seat by women in 
labor at the present time. Knowledge of 
this I owe to the kindness of Doctor R. Rus- 
sell Ross, Medical Officer of the Rio Tinto

Spanish Delivery-Pan. 

The vessel is made of strong glazed 
earthenware, and resembles entirely the pan 
of a close-stool, except for the excavation on 
one side through which the hand of the at- 
tendant gets access to the patient's pudenda, 
and through which the child can be guided 
forward. It is n}4 inches in depth in the 
interi* nches in width at the bottom. 

At the brim it measures 10 inches in diame- 
ter, extending to \$% inches at the outer 
margin of the flange, on which the patient 
and which is 2^ inches broad. The 
aperture in the side extends downward for 
a depth of six inches from the inner edge 
of the fUnge, and at its upper end is 
inches wide at the inner margin of the flange. 

Doctor Koss has made inquiries of his 
medical confreres in Seville and the capital 
of Huelva, but has not been able to ascertain 
from them that mention is made of this utensil 
in any obstetric work. It is spoken of by the 
natives usually as Bacin, the same designa- 
tion as is given to a large pan or basin which 
serves as a close-stool or slop-pail. Some-

some notice of this delivery-pan would have 
been taken by th&lt; whom I have

Spain is that "the use of the birth cha:: 
early into Spain through the 
physicians certainly introduced it there 
amongst the people. Perhaps it is still tc 
be found there; at least Hureau de 
leneuve says, 'The Spaniards often made 
use of a sort of arm chair open in front

toms in different countries in Europe, anc

For aught we know, the delivery-pan which 
Doctor Ross saw in use last summer ma; 
have been in use in Spain long before the 
time of the Arabians. However that ma) 
be, if the woman in labor were to be put 
a sitting posture she would find this simpl 
kind of seat more serviceable and safe froff 
a sanitary point of view than any of the 
chairs produced by the ingenuity of the mas 
ter minds in obstetrics of other countrie 
and other generations. — Edinburgh Mcdica

Pregnancy and Dental Caries. — Denta 
caries is a disease characterized by molecula 
disintegration of the normal constituents 
the teeth, and is probably more liable U 
occur during pregnancy; it is caused by th 
same processes which produce lactic acid 
which latter in turn decalcifies the enam 
and exposes the dentine. There is evideno 
to prove also that the saliva is more aci 
during the period of gestation than at oth 
times; which, if true, is probably due 
changes in the blood whereby its alkalinit;. 
is diminished. The analogy between til 
and the litha:mic condition is striking. 

It is improbable that lime salts are ab 
stracted from the teeth to supply the net 
the growing fcetus; more than enough pho? 
phates are ingested to supply the needs 
both mother and child, hence maternal teet 
do not suffer from lack of nutrition; a

HAVE WE ANY MEDICAL FACTS? 

BY JOHN R. HAMILTON, M.D., M.C.P.S. 

Inasmuch as the practice of medicine is 
largely composed of anomalies, we are often 
'led to regard the classification of diseases as 
greatly at fault, and to believe that the earlier 
teachers were often in error both as to classi- 
fication and therapeutics. 

A few decades since venesection was con- 
sidered an essential factor in the manage- 
ment of each and every ailment of the human 
race, to be followed almost as unvaryingly 
jby some of the depressants — antimony, for 
example; but to-day the demand is for stim- 
ulation and general supporting measures. It 
would now be difficult to point out a practi- 
tioner who dares practice blood-letting except 
perhaps in some rare and special instance. 
The old time calomel, while it still holds 
place in the armamentarium therapeuticum, no 
longer serves the purpose of a cholagogue, 
for which action it was originally extolled, 
tn a case in which cholecystotomy was per- 
'ormed by a medical friend it was found the 
low of bile (which was collected for several 
lays) was actually decreased by the adminis- 
ration of mercurous chloride; also that it 
vas greatly stimulated under the use of bis- 
nuth salicylate, a drug for which hitherto no 
uch specific action had ever been claimed. 

When we look back upon the myriad of 
lew remedies that within less than a decade 
lave become candidates for place in the 
nateria medica, only to shine for a month 
&gt;erhaps and then flicker and die, is it any 
wonder that doubt succeeds doubt and that 
he beliefs inculcated at the inception of the 
ledical career are constantly being weak- 
ned ? Look at the coal-tar derivatives and 
rotations in their numberless forms and 



striking nomenclatures ! Each and every 
one has been claimed as a specific, true and 
absolute, in some form of febrile or nervous 
disease; and yet all, when put to the test, 
proved to be either flat failures or of so un- 
certain and dangerous a character that they 
can be employed only in conjunction with 
some powerful heart and nerve restorative. 
In the near future — indeed, the reaction has 
already set in — we will be compelled to fall 
back upon less persuasive but much more 
safe and satisfactory drugs, such as obtained 
before these new medicaments made their 
debut in the medical world and set all rational 
therapeutics at naught. Another potent 
reason for discarding these synthetics and 
pseudo-synthetics is the prevalent practice of 
indiscriminate prescribing by the counter 
chemist — a practice that is so demoralizing 
and so fraught with danger to the public as 
to demand special legislation; it is well 
known these products can only be safely 
prescribed by a qualified physician, and even 
then their action requires to be critically 
watched, yet the percentage marketed 
through legitimate dispensing methods is 
known to be but a tithe of the great total of 
sales. 

The arguments employed, pro and con, re- 
garding the use of alcohol in medicine, are 
enough to befog the brain of the most faith- 
ful student; yet how few medical men can 
be found who, after a few years of practical 
experience, would undertake the duties of 
their calling without the aid of this drug ! 
When we reflect on this and many other 
questions of like nature that confront us at 
every turn of life, it must be concluded that, 
leaving anatomy aside, there are very few 
medical facts. 

On turning to pathology it is discovered 
that there is an even more marked division 
as to cause and effect than in therapeutics; 
and when was added the pathogenic microbe,

confusion seemed to have reached us max* 
imum. Perhaps at do time in medical history 
con Id this fact be more fully realized than in 

the present juncture, when it is found that 

the most beautiful platform ere&lt; ted by path- 

bacterioK g dily crumbles be- 

and dispassionate investigation. 

in Germany the KJebs-Loeffler bacillus first 
saw the light of day, and was claimed to 
afford certain settlement of all diagnostic 

disputes; but alas for the theory! the same 
little microbe is found in a score of maladies 
other than diphtheria, and moreover is fre- 
quently entirely lacking in the latter. So, 
the "cholera bacillus," so-called, is no 
more pathognomonic of the Asiatic scourge 
than of every-day rural scabies. We find 
another example of doubt when turning to a 
disease more generally prevalent than either 
diphtheria or cholera, viz., typhoid fever. In 
this malady, only a short time since the care- 
ful physician hesitated before he presumed 
to prescribe that mildest of cathartics, castor 
oil; but now, forsooth, it is found, according 
to the report of a Toronto practitioner, these 
cases should all be treated by active purga- 
tives at the very outset, whereby the percent- 
age of mortality will be greatly lowered, — I 
give this statement for what it is worth, but 
decline to stand sponsor thereto. And so 
we have a labyrinth of conflicting opinions, 
all doubtless the outcome of honest convic- 
tion and research, but which tend only to 
more impress the opinion that the profession 
is deficient in absolute medical facts. 

In corroboration of the foregoing diver- 
gencies of opinion, I have to dwell on an epi- 
demic of very unique character that occurred 
in my own neighborhood during the autumn 
and early winter of 1894. For any parallel 
to this the young practitioner would search 
his text-books in vain, as the only approxi- 
mate classification is a few lines by some 
author on herpetic tonsillitis, and even here 
the most striking symptoms are conspicuous 
only by their absence. This malady at times 
presented more the signs and symptoms indic- 
ative of diphtheria than those of tonsillitis. 
So prevalent was the epidemic that scarcely 
a family escaped its visitation. On examining 
the throat the exudate was generally found 
so exuberant as to form large patches in the 
same region of the fauces as the diphtheritic 



aa 

u- 

he, 



deposit occup uning about the same 

1 of time, and producing in many in] 
ight haemorrhage from the nose and 
throat. There was the same tumefaction of 
tonsils, swelling of cervical glands, and ft 
infiltration o\ surrounding I Stising en- 

largement of the neck — of shorter duration, 
.er, than in true diphtheria. In only 
one case did I see suppuration of the gland 
m a strumous subject. 

The affected children generally had a 
cided rise in temperature, sometimes to 103 
at the evening exacerbation. The pallor and 
listlessness of diphtheria were largely wan 
ing, although in some cases drowsiness pr 
sented itself as one of the symptoms. Th 
difficulty in deglutition, so common to a! 
diseases of the throat, was perhaps mo 
marked, but in most cases the appetite f 
food was not wholly wanting, and in many 
the amount of daily nourishment taken was 
about the normal quantity of health. T 
color of the exudate appeared to the nak 
eye to be nearly that of diphtheria, but per- 
haps not so ashen, and when removed from 
the throat dissolved more readily. The 
duration of the disease in most cases w 
about seven days, and convalescence super- 
vened and progressed much more rapidly 
than in the more malignant disease. In 
instance that I can recall did paralysis pre- 
sent itself as a sequel, the only thing of this, 
character being a hoarseness, or a nasal twang | 
to the voice, that soon passed off. 

Of this peculiar form of tonsillitis we mustn 
have had in this small town and neighbor- 1 
hood at least one thousand cases, while in 
the county at large two thousand woul 
probably be nearer the mark; and of th 
vast number, not one death was ever chroni 
cled that I could discover, either from t 
disease/^/- se or from its sequelae; in fact, 
soon as the dread of the epidemic, with i 
very diphtheria- like symptoms, had pa 
off, and it was discovered to be self-limited 
many families declined all medical attend- 
ance, nursing their sick through the trouble ■■■•- 
as in ordinary cases of cold or mild bron&lt; 
chitis. l;- r y 

Kvery practitioner has not the time or ap- 
pliances to make a culture test, nor the 
knowledge of the bacillus that would enable 
him to detect it when made; then

during the prevalence of this epidemic, as a 
! matter of satisfaction to himself, one of my 
imedical compeers sent a piece of membrane 
jto an expert in a neighboring city, who 
promptly reported it harbored the Klebs- 
Loeffler germ. The case from which this 
was taken in nowise differed from the others; 
it made the same rapid recovery, and ex- 
hibited none of the symptoms of depression 
or paralysis, or any other diphtheritic se- 
quelae. Now if in this case the Klebs-Loeffler 
bacillus was present — and I have no cause to 
ioubt its presence — we certainly have good 
grounds for accepting Hansemann's state- 
ment, corroborated as it is by a score and 
nore of equally reliable observers, that the 
;o-called diphtheria bacillus is often want- 
ng in true diphtheria, and as often present 
md harmless in many other diseases of the 
hroat. 

The question now naturally arises: Have 
ve this bacillus with us at all times? Does 
t remain dormant, merely awaiting an op- 
•ortunity, when the fortress is not guarded, 

assert its virulence ? In other words, is it 
ilways a stealthy enemy lying in wait for the 
iioment when atmospheric pressure is suit- 

ble and the vital force of the patient at low 
ibb, as some pathologists claim of the tuber- 
le bacillus ? 

In view of the foregoing history of an epi- 
emic, the like of which every medical man 
i'lust have seen, or something similar in the 
ay of anomalies, we are forced to the con- 
usion that the most learned of our profes- 
on have yet much to learn of diphtheria 
id its allied diseases, and when the anti- 
►xin treatment has been in use for a few 
'. jars we may still discover we have only a 
w medical facts. 

When one comes to the practical part of 

is *or a similar epidemic he can readily 

irdon the young man who calls it diphtheria, 

Ijtio naturally thinks his treatment specific, 

'■.id wonders at his marvellous success; but 

lfortunately, sooner or later after this great 

n of success, he is certain to encounter an 

"idemic of tke genuine death-dealing diph- 

'eria in which he loses every third case, 

T ien he will be apt to lay the blame of 

inorance upon his teachers and text-books, 

1 cause neither were sufficiently explicit in 



the differential diagnosis of diphtheria, and 
gave next to nothing as to the pathology and 
treatment of herpetic or follicular tonsillitis — 
nothing to enlighten him as to whether he is 
dealing with a simple and harmless case or 
with one of great dread and danger — in fact, 
whether he has on hand a case of life or 
death. While we excuse the younger man 
for his rashness in pronouncing a disease 
diphtheria which is not, we can never forgive 
the more aged schemer who pronounces it 
diphtheria for a sinister purpose. He sees 
in it a grand opportunity to increase not only 
his statistics but his popularity and his purse; 
by doing so he gets the ear and attention of 
the thoroughly frightened parents, who have 
seen (according to their limited sense of 
vision) just such cases in the family of Jones 
and Brown during a former epidemic where 
every third case died, while their present 
subject's advisor is not losing a case. Such 
fireworks are, however, generally, and fortu- 
nately, of short duration, and the owner is 
soon only in possession of the rocket-stick; 
nevertheless he will re-light this when the 
next epidemic of roseola visits his constitu- 
ency, which of course will be called " scarlet 
fever " and treated with unprecedented suc- 
cess. 

When we see nosologists, and all medical 
writers in fact, going to great trouble to give 
the differential points between diphtheria and 
scarlet fever — a fact ten times more easily 
discovered by the student of medicine than 
the differential diagnosis between the former 
and the epidemic malady just under con- 
sideration — we are again forced to believe 
that the authors of the future will view diph- 
theria in a different light than they have 
done in the past, and not try to convince us 
(as many eminent men of the British Isles 
have done) that croup and diphtheria are 
one and the same disease; in fact, a few 
good men still cling to that belief. We, of 
course, who have practiced in this country, 
think we see such a marked contrast between 
the sthenic croup and the asthenic listless 
diphtheria that we wonder at such a conclu- 
sion, and wonder more whether we have any 
medical facts.

A few of Skoda's more eminent colleagues 
ft brief mention: Op poller (iXoS-i.s; 1 ) 
ngularly gifted in diagnosis, popular, a 
teacher of wide influence, and manifest- 
superlative degree the characteristics that 
constitute a truly great physician; he wrote 
little, but was for a long time professor of 
medicine at Prague. Von Hebra the elder 
- :) worked a complete revolution in 
dermatology, and developed a classification 
based upon the pathological anatomy of the 
skin. He instituted a new and independent 
line of therapeutics as applied to this branch of 
our art, for which the medical world will ever 
hold him in grateful remembrance. Sigmund 
and Xeissel during the same period did much 
to clear up the problems of syphilis. To 
Czermak (1828-1873) and Tiirck (1807-186S) 
we are indebted (practically) for the making 
a specialty of diseases of the nose and larynx ; 
of like service to ophthalmology were Jager, 
Jaxtthal, Arlt, Stellwag Von Carion, Hasner, 
Mauthmer, Fuchs, and Von Reuss, while 
Gruber and Politzer did as much for diseases 
of the ear. 

An indirect offshoot of the new Vienna 
school is the so-called " Physiological Medi- 
cine," founded by Roser (181 7-1888), of 
Stuttgart (later professor of surgery in Mar- 
burg), seconded by Griesinger and Wunder- 
lich. Their views were directed against the 
symptomatologists and idealists, and particu- 
larly against the School of Natural History, 
the claim being that physiology must include 
vital phenomena,«and from the morbid por- 
tions of these phenomena a special science 
should be formed as an artificial yet practical 
division of knowledge. Wiinderlich's book 
of therapeutics was for a long time the best 
guide in this direction, inasmuch as it left to 
individual thought and judgment — the Hip- 
pocratic method of investigation — the de- 
termination of value and demand. Another 
offshoot, that differs but little from this save

in definition, is the "School of Rational 
Medicine." originated by Pfeufer ( i 806 1 
and Henle ( ; and which, since 

has beed represented by a jour- 

nal. While W iinderlich claimed pathology 
to be the physiology of the sick, Henle 
sidered this questionable and made no dis- 
tinction at all between the physiology of the 
healthy and that of the ill. The language 
of the followers of this school conti 
strongly with that emanating from other 
schools, and for a time was confident and 
ingeniously triumphant; nevertheless it did 
not forget philosophical speculation, and 
Hegel may now be regarded as indirectly 
the godfather of rational medicine. 

The vagaries of Paracelsus led indirect! 
though positively to the foundation of Homoe- 
opathy, and likewise originated the doctrine 
that bears the name of Rademacher 
1849). It i s curious that this pseudo-Para 
celsic system should spring up alongside of 
the Vienna school, its teachings being the 
classification of diseases by their therapy 
Rademacher's followers possessed three uni 
versal remdies, "cubic nitre (nitrate of soda) 
copper, and iron," and also three prima 
diseases that must take their titles from the 
three universal medicaments. In spite of th 
admission that these diseases were unknown 
it was boldly asserted they were with cer- 
tainty to be cured by the three chief reme- 
dies The three primary diseases, "sod? 
nitrate, copper, and iron diseases," do no 
necessarily remain as such, as they may th

and thus it results that iron disease may ex 1 
press itself in the form of consumption, delir. 
ium tremens, etc., while a copper disease ma; 
appear as worms, paralysis, jaundice, etc.^ 
Beside universal diseases and universal rem 
edies there were diseases of organs, to b* 
diagnosed by the efficacy of organ remedie 
— thus, abdominal diseases must be rel 
by corresponding "abdominal remedies, 
head diseases with "head remedies," cru 
diseases with "chest remedies," etc. 
for each particular viscus there must be 
special remedy. What is most surprising c 
this absurd doctrine is that it found follow

System — the great apostle of which \

Priessnitz (1799-185 2) — based upon gross 
views of humoral pathology, according to 
which a disease entity was to be expelled in 
the form of sweat, eruption, etc. Poultices, 
cold packs and cold baths were the principal 
therapeutic measures. Winternitz has made 
hydrotherapy popular and in a measure effec- 
tive in the management of certain maladies. 
Rudolph Virchow in 1858 instituted the 
doctrine or theory known as " Modern Vital- 
ism," which in fact was borrowed from natu- 
ral scientific medicine and distinguished from 
the vitalism of the previous century in that 
t breaks up the old vital force, which was 
supposed to be either distributed throughout 
[be entire body or located in a few organs, 
nto an indefinite number of associate vital 
orces working harmoniously, and assigns to 
hem all the final elementary principles with- 
:ut microscopic seat. "Every animal prin- 
ciple has a sum of vital unities, each of which 
&gt;ears all the characteristics of life. The char- 
cteristics and unity of life cannot be found 
,1 any determinate point of a higher organ- 
sni, e. g. in the brain, but only in the definite, 
ver-recurring arrangement of each element 
resent; hence it results that the composition 
f a large body amounts to a kind of social 
rrangement, in which each one of the move- 
lents of individual existence is dependent 
pon the others, but in such a way that each 
ement has a special activity of its own, and 
lat each, although it receives the impulse to 
s own activity from other parts, still itself 
irforms its own functions." This is nothing 
Jt another way of expressing the cell doc- 
me to which many medical men are now 
•&gt;mmitted, which means that all bodies are 
lilt up of cells, and that each cell has a unity 
•id a purpose of its own. 
In 1677 Sir Robert Hooke discovered plant 
• lis; later Schwann discovered animal cells, 
i d Robert Brown cell nuclei; but it remained 
lr Virchow to supply the gap which had risen 
Uween anatomical knowledge and medical 
teory — that is, to supply a "cellular path- 
ogy," since which time the cell has assumed 
ti role which the fibre occupied in the theo- 
rs of the seventeenth and eighteenth centu- 
I s. Time alone can decide as to the ultimate 
v idity of this theory, which has in certain 
ccles been most enthusiastically received. 
Ce of its weakest aspects is, perhaps, that 



the so-called intercellular substance plays an 
uncertain and unsatisfactory part. An import- 
ant feature in which the cellular pathology 
differs from other systems, and particularly 
from the old humoral pathology, is in the 
doctrine that the blood itself is not the proper 
and original cause of dyscrasiae, and probably 
not the cause of continuous alteration of the 
tissues; that these dyscrasiae arise because 
the blood is not an independent structure, 
but dependent upon the condition of the pa- 
tient in consequence of its continuous con- 
veyance of noxious material from all parts of 
the body — the blood is therefore merely the 
medium for the production of the dyscrasia. 
This theory has made several peculiar, new 
and symptomatic or morphological forms of 
disease, such as leukaemia, leucocytosis, etc. 
Virchow also cleared up the old and obscure 
ideas regarding pyaemia, and proved that an 
absorption of pus into the blood, which the 
name implies, is quite impossible; likewise 
that pyaemia is inseparable from thrombotic 
processes. 

Virchow was born in 1821 in Pomerania, 
and in 1849 distinguished himself by attain- 
ing the highest grade in the career of the 
learned, a professorship which he first held in 
Wiirzburg. During earlier years his resi- 
dence and labors were largely the result of 
necessities arising from political views, for 
on account of these he was long denied 
a residence in Berlin. A personal friend, 
now an old man, an interne in the great 
Julius Spital in Wiirzburg at the time when 
Virchow taught there, tells me a light was 
burned every night in Virchow's room until 
3 a.m. and yet the Professor was always out 
at work by 7. It was by such intense appli- 
cation that he arrived at his present position 
at the very top of the professional ladder; 
but very few men have the physique and 
constitution to stand such arduous study. In 
1856 he assumed the chair of pathological 
anatomy in Berlin, and introduced micro- 
scopic anatomy, to which Rokitansky had 
not given sufficient attention. Virchow was 
a former pupil of Johannes Miiller, famous 
as a physiologist and pathologist, and his 
views to-day are often tinged by the doc- 
trines acquired from this great teacher. He 
is also a great admirer of Harvey, whose 
picture, at least for a long time, was the only

"Tumors" in 1866, in which he carried out 
the division of morbid growths originally 

adopted by Johannes M idler in 1838, I 
tying them according to their microscopic- 
elements. He is also scarcely more cele- 
brated for his teachings and labors than for 
the number of famous pupils brought up 
under his influence, among whom may be 
mentioned Leyden, Reklinghausen, Cohn- 
heim, Waldeyer, Kiihne, and Rindfleisch. As 
a result of his labors has arisen in Germany 
what has been called the "Medical School of 
Natural Sciences," that seeks by means of 
pathological anatomy and microscopy, ex- 
perimental physiology and pathology, and 
the other applied methods, to make of medi- 
cine an exact science; and to it belong such 
men as Zeimssen, Gerhardt, Nothnagel, 
Liebermeister, Senator, Erb, Vogel, and 
others. An offshoot from this is the so- 
called "Munich Clinical School," to which 
belong Von Buhl, Pettenkofer, Seitz, and 
Oertel. 

The splitting up of medicine into special- 
ties, and the increase of its subordinate 
branches into schools so-called, resulted in 
great danger to the unity of medical science. 
A return to the methods which combine sci- 
ence and practice, the so-called clinical-prac- 
tical method, is again sought by men who 
have established the well known Zeitschrift 
fur Klinische Medicin under the management 
of Frerichs and Leyden — a journal which 
has already done a great deal of good. 

The versatile Bouchut, of Paris, has re- 
cently published a theory, the so-called 
,4 Seminalism," for which the claim is made 
that he grants nothing to hypothesis and 
everything to observation; its characteristic 
is that this new theory is also vitalistic — in 
fact, the French have scarcely ever brought 
forth any other than vitalistic theories. Bor- 
deu and Barthez, during the previous century, 
created the first French theory, which was 
followed by Bichat and later by Bouchut, 
who as a matter of fact owes much to Bichat. 
Bouchut teaches that beasts have an intelli- 
gence of instinct, and men one of abstraction; 
no beast oversteps the limits of animal 
thought, which is separated by an abyss from 



the productive thought of men; then 

proper kingdom of man m aocordancc with 

."•rial nature; also that the- vital for 
men and of beasts are entirely different from 
each other, and that the principle of phj 
identity remains in the bo ich, since 

the constantly renewed mass is formed in ex- 
act accordance with the original plans; in 
all the Changes of his elements man is identi- 
cal with man; all internal and external causes 
of disease modify more or less the vital force 
and its impressibility in the fluids or at some 
point in the economy, either increasing it or 
diminishing it. This theory, published in 
1873, claimed "in the abstraction of its prom 
ise and completeness of its conclusions tc 
yield to none of its predecessors." Vet even 
in France the task of transforming medicine 
into a natural and exact science is far from 
being a. fait accompli. 

The most recent theories of disease are 
the result of microscopical study of germs— 
the germ theory, in fact — and stand in the 
closest possible relation with the doctrine o! 
spontaneous generation, fermentation, miasm 
and contagion. In 1838 Ehrenberg regardec 
infusoria as animals, but Dujardin in 1841 
expressed doubts, and Perty in 1852 affirm 
that most forms classified as infusoria shoulc- 
be asigned to the vegetable kingdom, when 
a little later Naegeli relegated them. Th&lt; 
correctness of this conclusion was proved b) 
Cohn, who also perfected a classification: 
This particular form of investigation beg 
in the twenties of the present century 
assumed its present direction in the thirtie. 
and forties. Gaspard, in 1S23, renewed th&lt; 
experiments of Haller and injected into th; 
veins of animals not alone putrescent ma 
terial, but the blood of other creatures suffer 
ing from the effect of such injections. Bassi 
in 1835, discovered the cause of silkworn 
disease, thereby giving special impulse to th 
theory of parasitism, and this was quickl 
followed by evidence of the existence of botl 
vegetable and animal exciters of diseas 
Shoenlein in 1839 demonstrated the fungu 
of favus; Vogel discovered the oidium a, 
in 1840; Goodsir the sarcina ventriculi i: 
1 841; but the greatest influence upon th 
development of the parasitic or germ th* 
was the sequel to the discovery of the an 
thrax bacillus by Davaine in 1850. Ii

Latour and Schwann demonstrated that the 
cells which were known even to Leeuwen- 
hoek were actually vegetable forms, and 
Schulze had already pointed out that fer- 
mentation of fluids could only occur in the 
presence of extremely minute vegetable 
organisms; Chevreuil next showed that ani- 
mal solids remained free from decomposition 
when protected from the access of germs; 
and in 1857 Pasteur demonstrated that fer- 
mentation and putrefaction were caused, not 
by chemical forms, as Liebig had taught, but 
simply by the agency of lower organisms, 
which he divided into aerobes and anaerobes; 
and in 1868 Chauveau queried as to whether 
morbific elements resided in the formed 
element of germs or in their fluid constitu- 
ents. Thus the theory of contagium vivum, 
rfor which Henle contended as early as 182 1, 
was not forgotten. In Germany Klebs and 
Hueter became the prominent champions of 
•this theory; Hallier had designated his so- 
called u micro sp or on septicum " and introduced 
a method of fractional cultures. The views 
:&gt;f Klebs were opposed by Billroth, who con- 
tended for his "phlogistic ferment" and 
V coccobacteria septica" upon which he wrote 
in elaborate and extensively illustrated 
-reatise; he also at that time opposed the 
;pecific character of the lower organisms as 
lisease agents. Hallier's microsporon was re- 
uted by Cohn, who studied and classified 
'he various fungi and distinguished between 
he pathogenic and the septicogenic — that is, 
hose which produced disease and those 
vhich produced ordinary putrefaction. Then 
ame the experimental evidence of Davaine 
nd Koch, who demonstrated the develop- 
lent of bacteria from spores. It is hardly 
ecessary to discuss this theory further, but 
may mention the labors of Panum and of 
'•rieger, who deeply investigated the poisons 
/oduced by bacteria, to which are given the 
eneral titles of ptomaines and toxines. 
It would be unjust, however, did I not 
lention the name of Lister in connectien 
ith the inestimable benefit that has accrued 
&gt; surgery from the practical application of 
le theory of infection to wounds — a measure 
lat brought about an entire revolution in 
irgery and surgical technique, and an entire 
;versal of the statistics of operations; where 
lousands formerly died, thousands now live, 



their lives being indirectly due to the labors 
of this one man and his following. 

I will add that it is necessary to realize the 
difference between life and death to appreci- 
ate the changes that have been brought about 
during the last score of years. Much that in 
former years was unjustifiable has become 
both justifiable and feasible; today patients 
as a matter of course live after operations 
which, so recently as when I was a student, 
were considered impossible, or if performed 
exposed the operator to the charge of man- 
slaughter. 

I have spoken of the impulse which came 
from Avenbrugger's invention of percussion, 
which was greatly extended through the 
translation of his work by Corvisart (1755— 
182 1 ); the latter also excelled as a clinical 
teacher and pathological anatomist, and had 
much to do with the education of others of 
his confreres whose names are lustrous in 
history. Among the most celebrated was 
Laennec (1781-1826), who, though brought 
up among most trying surroundings, early 
manifested a zeal for medicine. He became 
a field surgeon in the French army soon after 
the Reign of Terror, and pushed his classical 
and medical studies with restless zeal. In 
1815 his first experiments were made with 
the stethoscope, the invention of which was 
due to accident: in order to hear the sounds 
of the heart more clearly, he one day applied 
a cylindrical roll of paper, and then immedi- 
ately constructed the whole form of the 
stethoscope upon the principle now every- 
where resorted to. In 1819 he published his 
work on Mediate Auscultation — a treatise on 
prognosis in disease of the lungs and heart, 
based principally upon this new aid to inves- 
tigation. The treatise was speedily trans- 
lated into all the languages of Europe. After 
enjoying a large practice Laennec succumbed 
to ill health at the early age of forty-five. 
He seems to have had but slight apprecia- 
tion of his own services to medicine, and to 
have prided himself rather on his skill in 
riding horseback. Honor and fame, how- 
ever, followed closely upon the publication 
of his well known work, and the manuals of 
physical diagnosis which now find frequent 
mention in book catalogues and come from 
various and wide sources are the legitimate 
outcome of Laennec's pioneer treatise.

Cammann, of New York, and ran justly be 

claimed for American medicine. ( Hher meth- 
ods of physical examination, like spirometry, 

chest measurement, and study of expired air, 

have been introduced since iSa(&gt;. The oph- 
thalmoscope, which has been of such Sterling 

service, and is based upon the simplest of 

principles, was the invention of the famous 
Helmholtz, but just deceased. The princi- 
ple of endoscopy — the illumination and vis- 
ual examination of the various cavities of the 
human body. — the various specula, the spec- 
troscope, the sphygmograph, the more accu- 
rate record of physical sounds, the application 
of electricity, and the employment of ther- 
mometry, represent a few of the strides in 
the medical science of the present century, 
thereby aiding and perfecting the art of diag- 
nosis, which in turn must ever necessarily 
form the basis for all rational treatment. Let 
no one complain that we are still so far 
from certainty in every case; the wonder 
is that so much has been discovered in so 
short a space of time. 

Wonderful as have been these advances, 
the greatest achievements have accrued to 
the department of surgery, which Chamisso 
terms "the seeing portion of the healing art." 
The sixteenth century opened the way for 
checking of hemorrhages; the seventeenth 
accomplished great simplifications and im- 
provement in the way of dressing wounds; 
the eighteenth gave a refining and elevating 
tendency to the study of applied practice, 
and raised surgery to a level with other 
branches of science; and now the nineteenth 
century has, toward its close, made surgery 
as nearly, perhaps, as it ever can be, an exact 
science, to which every other branch of science 
has been made contributory. The chain-saw, 
invented in 1806 by Jeffery, alone gave an 
impetus to resection, which was cultivated 
especially in Germany; to resection was added 
osteotomy by Heine and Mayer; this in turn 
was succeeded by the so-called subcutaneous 
osteotomy of Langenbeck in 1854; Stromeyer 
introduced subcutaneous tenotomy in 1831, 



which was a very pronounced advance on 
all that hail gone before; then came the in- 
troduction of anesthesia, by which were made 
possible Operations that had been DC

rubber bandage by Bsmarcn in 1873, l&gt;'ood : 

lethodfl were made r&gt; - Pain and 

rrhage, the two great of the 

conscientious surgeon, being thus almost an- 
nihilated, there was left but an apparently 
theoretical limit to what the surgeon migfal 
accomplish. Orthopaedic surgery, introduced 
by Delpech, was unknown prior to 1816; it 
was first practiced systematically by Stro- 
meyer and popularized in France by Guerin. 
Operations on nerves were studied as special 
methods by Schuh, Werhher, and Nussbauoi 
Jobert and Simon abroad, and Sims and Km- 
met in the United States, by their studies of 
fistulae peculiar to the genito-urinary tract 
in females, have conferred inestimable bene- 
fits upon suffering womanhood. — So late as 
1839 Vidal declared there did not exist in the 
history of surgery a single well authenticated 
case of complete cure of vesico-vaginal tear. 
It was not my intention to more than 
barely refer to the living surgeons of to-day, 
or those who have but very recently passed 
away from us; but it would be an injustice 
to overlook Bernhard von Langenbeck and 
Theodor Billroth. The former, born in 1810 
and deceased in 1887, was for a time a teacher 
of physiology, but subsequently became the 
successor of Dieffenbach in the University of 
Berlin. The influence he exerted upon sur 
gery in Germany and (since the decline of 
French precedence) upon surgery all over 
the world, has perhaps been greater than 
that of any one man since Dupuytren's time. 
He it was that introduced into surgical 
technique and surgical pathology the experi- 
mental method of which Johannes M idler 
was the great exponent; indeed, the relatively 
high importance which pathology is given to- 1 
day in every surgical curriculum is due more 
to his labors than to those of any other on 
man. Genial, learned, indefatigable, he w 
the ideal accomplished teacher. It would be 
impossible in any short risum&lt; f of his life and 
labors to do justice to so distinguished a 
man, to whom the profession owes so much. 
Perhaps the highest testimonial that could 
be given would be the enumeration of the

men who were ever and always his enthusi- 
astic admirers. Langenbeck was the founder 
of the German Congress of Surgeons, and 
for many years its president, and the perma- 
nent home this association has built for itself 
in Berlin bears his name; the surgical jour- 
nal he founded has now passed its fortieth 
volume, and is to-day the first periodical of 
its class in any country or language. 

Theodor Billroth, who only within a few 
months joined the great silent majority, was 
|for many years the surgical sun of Austro- 
Hungary, around whom revolved all the 
other lights of the profession in the empire. 
He was as expert with the microscope as 
with the knife, and equally great with both. 
Although his great and elaborate work on 
r Cocco- Bacteria Septica" is now obsolete, it 
nevertheless marked an era in surgical pa- 
:hology, as does also his text-book on the 
same subject, which reached fifteen editions 
ind has been widely translated. He it was 
,vho made the first resection of the larynx 
:md of the stomach, and to him we are in- 
iebted for many other daring operations. 
It was the fame of this teacher that in recent 
rears led young Americans to Vienna, and 
le set the example in every way for a con- 
stantly growing number of students whose 
lames are, or ere long will be, famous. 
'Billroth was born in 1819 in Bergen, and 
ucceeded Schuh in Vienna after having 
aught most acceptably at Zurich. What he 
vas to his teacher Langenbeck, such are the 
-ounger German surgeons, like Czerny, Gus- 
enbauer, Mikulicz, and others, to him. 

Here may be recalled the pride with which 
Americans greet the name of McDowell, who 
•erformed the first ovariotomy, and prepared 
he way for a branch of abdominal surgery 
he results of which have fairly astonished 
he world. 
There is much to be said also for certain 
leasures, such as the introduction into sur- 
ery of plaster-of-paris, by Larrey ; of starched 
andages, by Seutin; of absorbable material 
:&gt;r ligatures and sutures, the latter from ani- 
lal sources. Finally, antiseptic — or better, 
septic — methods of operating and caring for 
ljuries and wounds, have worked a revolu- 
on that is in methods and results perhaps 
ie most important known to medical history. 
At the beginning of the present century the 



. 



French appeared to lead in matters surgical, 
and were distinguished by dexterity in oper- 
ating, fertility of invention, accuracy of ob- 
servation, and clearness of clinical teaching. 
The foundation of this reputation was laid by 
Desault, and upon it his successors continued 
to build. From his school descended the 
barber-surgeon Boyer (1757-1833), who be- 
came the first surgeon and trusted adviser of 
Napoleon, and was by him created a baron. 
He was the author of a work, in eleven 
volumes, which has survived many editions 
and translations, and therein he laid espe- 
cial stress upon after-treatment. Richerand 
(1779-1840), like Boyer, was made a baron, 
and was a professor in Paris; but his charac- 
ter suffered from his overweening ambition 
and vanity; he was wont to exhibit most un- 
pleasant personal traits, but nevertheless his 
surgical ability entitles him to front rank 
among his contemporaries. The third sur- 
geon honored with the rank of baron was 
Larrey (1766-1842), surgeon-in-chief to the 
Grand Army, and whom Napoleon I. called 
the most virtuous of men. In 1772 he joined 
the Army of the Rhine, and was the physi- 
cian of the so-called "flying ambulance" for 
twenty-two years. He was present in sixty 
great battles (including that of Waterloo) 
and four hundred engagements, and was three 
times wounded. His memoirs and mono- 
graphs on subjects connected with military 
surgery cause him to be often quoted even at 
the present day. It is recorded that he per- 
formed two hundred amputations in a single 
day; during the march through Russia he 
had at one time in Smolensk 10,000 men to 
care for in one hospital. A wonderful organ- 
izer, he was idolized by the soldiers and seems 
to have been held in nearly the same esteem 
as his great prototype, Ambrose Pare. 

The most famous French surgeon of this 
century, equally celebrated as a diagnosti- 
cian, as an operator, and as a teacher, was 
Baron Dupuytren (1777-1835). As a child 
he had been stolen on account of his eminent 
beauty. His early life was one of poverty 
and want. He zealously devoted himself to 
anatomy and physiology as foundations for 
successful work in surgery, and ultimately 
secured a private practice that embraced all 
France, and when visiting other countries 
was received like a prince. For years he

- llted from empyema, for which 
he declined operation, preferring, as he said, 
"to die at the hands of Cod rather than man." 
The first truly scientific practitioner of 
orthopredic surgery in France was Delpech 
(i 777-1832), of Toulouse, who was likewise 
the pioneer in subcutaneous tenotomy of the 
tendo Achillis and in autoplastic operations. 
At his own expense he erected a large ortho- 
paedic institute in Montpellier, and his death 
occurred while on his way to pay a visit to 
this institution, both he and his coachman 
being shot by an insane patient upon whom 
he had operated. 

Dupuytren's successor in the Hotel Dieu 
was Roux (1780-1S54), who earned specific 
reputation as a dextrous and rapid operator; 
his labors in constructive and plastic surgery 
were extraordinary. The first to apply phys- 
ical investigation to surgery was Lisfranc 
( 1 790-1 847), best remembered, perhaps, in 
connection with amputation of the foot. 
Marjolin (1770-1850) was a teacher of emi- 
nence, as were also Sanson (1 790-1841) and 
Cloquet (1 790-1883), though the latter is 
better remembered for his works on anatomy 
than for his exploits in surgery. Civiale 
(1792-1867) is chiefly famous for revamping 
the operation of lithotrity, for, though a 
lithotrite had been invented by D'Etoilles, 
Civiale was the first actual operator, for 
which he was fiercely opposed by Larrey, 
Sanson, Velpeau, and others; he lived to see 
his rivals confounded, and lithotrity accepted 
as a legitimate surgical procedure. Amussat 
(1 796-1 856) re-invented torsion of arteries 
for the repression of haemorrhage, for al- 
though this measure had been suggested by 
the ancients, it was held to be suitable only 
for very small vessels; he never held a pro- 
fessorship, yet at his residence were gathered 
so-called "conferences" that were attended 
by the most eminent medical men of the 



time; he is specially known in connection with 
the operation for opening the colon in the 
lumbar region. Prav lrgeon of

which he devised. Yidal (1803

gery in five volumes, wh 
translated and reprinted throughout Europe. 
Jobert de Lamballe (1 799-1867) m-c from 
abject poverty to a professorship and 
in the Academie; he is particularly remem- 
bered for his achievements in plastic 1 
tions. Velpeau (1 795-1868) in 1S34 beca 
the successor of Boyer; popular as a teach 
and an author of great fertility, he devo 
attention alike to surgery and midwifery; h 
Operative Surgery, in three volumes, and a 
treatise on Diseases of the Mammary &lt; 
are still classics. Gerdy (1 797-1 N56), lib

ents; in 1S33 he became a professor, ai 
wrote extensively on bandages, dressing, a

Bonnet (1 802-1 858) rendered great service 
surgery by his researches upon diseases 
the joints. Malgaigne (1806-1865), m 
professor of operative surgery in Paris 
1865, devoted great attention to surg 
anatomy, operative and experimental surgery 
and especially to fractures and dislocati 
— his work on fractures is met with on m 
book-shelves to-day. Nelaton (1807-1874) 
was surgeon to Emperor Napoleon III., and 
though he wrote little, became peculiarly 
eminent as a practitioner; his ingeniou: 
probe tipped with porcelain, by means 0. 
which he located a bullet in the foot of ( 
baldi, is well known. He devoted special 
attention to tuberculosis of bones and ji 
being, perhaps, further instigated thereto b; 
the case of the Prince Imperial; his treatis* 
on this subject forms most acceptable read 
ing to-day, and he taught the existence 
osseous tuberculosis long before such wa 
recognized in either Great Britain, Germany 
or the United States.

easily acquaint himself from sources which 
are at the command of all. 

I pass now to the Italians, who since Scarpa's 
Ume have never made any very decided im- 
pression upon surgery, although there are 
Inany most excellent practitioners of the art 
In Italy; the best known are Porta (1800- 
[875), Vanzetta (born 1809), and Rizzoli 
who died in 1880); Riberi, Tizzoni, Loreta, 
durante and others are perhaps equally en- 
itled to mention. 

Since the time of Gimbernat there have 
&gt;een no surgeons in Spain whose services 
lave been sufficiently important to rouse 
ipecial attention away from their native pen- 
insula. The Spaniards are well educated and 
zell equipped for practice, but do not appear 
,s great originators nor experimenters — 
oubtless because their medical schools and 
niversities long since lost prestige, owing to 
lerical and Inquisitorial interference; never- 
fheless Spanish medical literature has kept 
'ell abreast with that of other countries. 

In Great Britain the example of John 

lunter, during the eighteenth century, pro- 

uced results of the greatest importance; 

dvances were made simultaneously in physi- 

logy and pathology which the Anglo-Saxon 

: ices have been quick to utilize. While per- 

aps more conservative and less inventive 

,Jian the French, the surgeons of England 

ave ever been in the front rank, and quite 

irly they gave great attention to careful local 

letetic and hygienic measures of which Con- 

nental surgeons were, and are, too often 

'?.glectful. English surgeons, too, while 

ley have been specialists, have never been 

.lite so narrow in their respective fields as 

e Continental surgeons, and it has always 

ien rare to find one who was not also a 

&gt;od general practitioner; the immense ad- 

intages which this added knowledge con- 

rs must be apparent. The most celebrated 

presentative of British surgery of this cen- 

' ( ry was the son of a clergyman, Sir Astley 

Ooper, born in Norfolk in 1748, but subse- 

'lently a residentof London. During youth 

I resolutely compressed the bleeding limb 

&lt; a playmate who was the victim of an acci- 

« nt, so that time was gained for the arrival 

i a surgeon who then tied the vessel; this 

&lt;cided his future calling, and he pursued 

h studies in London, Edinburgh, and on 



the Continent. In 1791 he settled down to 
private practice, which soon yielded him an 
income in excess of ^£20,000 ($100,000), for 
his day the equivalent of twice that amount 
at present. At the age of seventy-three he 
succumbed to a long-standing asthma. He 
was a somewhat voluminous writer, and his 
works on fractures, dislocations, and diseases 
of the breast are by no means obsolete. His 
motto was: "First observe, and then think." 
Exceptionally endowed with all the graces 
of person, he became one of the most pop- 
ular and influential men of his day; withal, 
he was always zealous for his profession, 
never unoccupied, and charitable to a high 
degree. Of his boldness we have evidence 
in the fact that in 181 7 he tied the abdominal 
aorta, being the first to undertake this sur- 
gical feat. 

A colleague of Cooper's at St. Thomas's 
Hospital was Travers, already spoken of in 
connection with irritation. Tyrrel, a nephew 
of Cooper, was a well known surgeon, partic- 
ularly in diseases of the eye. Others of the 
same name were: Samuel Cooper (1781-1848), 
who wrote a voluminous treatise on practical 
surgery; Bransby Cooper (1 792-1853), Sir 
Astley's nephew and adopted son, who was 
well known, and who achieved an eminence 
that is only dimmed by that of his uncle. 

Sir Benjamin Brodie (1783-1862) was dis- 
tinguished as a special investigator and a 
soft-tissue operator, of whom it is said that, 
basing his actions upon his statistics, the 
older he became the less frequently he oper- 
ated. His best known writings concern dis- 
ease of the joints. Guthrie (1 785-1856), a 
man of noble characteristics, was the friend 
and companion of Wellington, whom he ac- 
companied in all his campaigns. Although 
well known as a lithotomist, his fame rests 
chiefly upon studies and writings in the 
domain of military surgery. A colleague of 
his in the Westminster Hospital, Sir William 
Lawrence (1 783-1867), was surgeon to the 
Queen, highly esteemed as a dextrous oper- 
ator, and an authority on ruptures and o* 
operative surgery. John Lizars (1783-1861) 
was a pupil of John Bell, and distinguished 
himself as a bold operator and fertile writer; 
early in the century he treated chronic hydro- 
cephalus by operation. Robert Liston (1794- 
1847) was another remarkable surgeon and a

irches Oil the nerves, and he also 
on op- mewhat famed 

for his opposition to venesection. 

In Edinburgh, James Syme (1799-1870) 
secured great reputation both by his dexterity 
as an operator- which is spoken of by his own 
pupil- us — and by his introduction 

of resection into general practice. Sir James 
tnpson (1811-1870) aided to make the 
Edinburgh school famous by his researches 
into the domain of both surgery and obstet- 
Though the inventor of acupressure, 
his name will forever be associated with the 
luction of anaesthesia. Professor Dunn 
says that, " after seeing the terrible agony of 
a poor Highland woman under amputation of 
the breast, Simpson left the class-room and 
went straight to Parliament House to seek 
work as a solicitor's clerk. But on second 
thought he returned to the study of medicine, 
asking: 'Can anything be done to make 
operations less painful?' The ultimate re- 
sult was the discovery of chloroform, and so 
the suffering of one became the occasion of 
the deliverance of many." Upon his advo- 
cacy of chloroform in obstetrics he had to 
defend himself against most vehement attacks 
of both Scotch and English clergymen, who 
affected to regard such procedure as a crime 
that transgressed the will of the Deity; but 
he successfully confounded these assailants 
with their own w T eapons, proving himself their 
more than equal in knowledge of scripture 
lore. 

Many other British surgeons, living and 
dead, deserve most honorable mention, but 
time and space will not permit. I cannot, 
however, pass by without mention Curling, 
Annandale, Chiene, Cheyne, Macewen, Ogs- 
ton, Jonathan Hutchinson, Sir James Paget, 
Christopher Heath, Thomas Langmore, 
Savory, Holden, Holmes, Adams, Sir Joseph 
Lister and Sir Prescott Hewitt, of the value 
of whose labors I have already tried to speak; 
Sir William Ferguson, of whom it is said that 
he had the eagle's eye, a lion's heart, and a 
lady's hand; John Bowman, best known for 
his work in ophthalmic surgery; Sir Henry 
Thompson, the eminent lithotomist and litho- 
tritist; and Sir Spencer Wells, Keith, Lawson 
Tait, and Bantock, whose names are insepar- 



able from the history of abdominal surgery 
And what can be said of the young men wh( 
are being trained in the methods and 
tice of their predecessors — trained not ool 
in the direction of manual dexterity, I 
experimental science, to which they maki 
the former subservient? All honor to thesi 
scions of Great Britain's surgical art. wh&lt; 
have astonished the world with their con 
summate ability ! I would that time permit 
ted recapitulation of the work accomplishes 
in late years by the present generation 
men in London, Edinburgh, and other medi 
cal centres; but the scope of these paper 
does not cover this ground. 

I now draw to a more or less abrupt cl 
this series of lectures, in which, as I ha 
been obliged to cull and condense fro 
.various sources, and hence oftentimes to 1 
extremely brief in detail, I fear justice ha 
been done in but few instances. To epito 
mize the history of twenty centuries int 
ten lectures, is of itself a task from which 
might have shrunk had I possessed a fui, 
realization of what was before me. As it u 
the aim has been merely to present a bar 
skeleton of medical history.

THE PATHOGENESIS OF ALBUMINURIA 

BY DOCTOR MARIANO SEMMOLA. 



Subcutaneous injections of egg-albume

vhich during the first twenty-four to forty- 
:ight hours is not accompanied by any histo- 
ogical modification of the kidneys. ' This is 
l phenomenon conditioned by the elimina- 
ion of a toxalbumen — that is, an albumen 
Vhich gains access to the circulation in the 
arm of a foreign substance (a substance not 
apable of being rendered assimilable). It 
&gt;, accordingly, a fact that the albumen, in 
rder to filter through the kidney, needs no 
;sion of the epithelium, as has been asserted 
Dr nearly half a century on the basis of an 
rroneous and purely arbitrary physiological 
jtw, and as is yet asserted by the deluded 
artisans of the nephrogenetic theory of albu- 
linuria. The persistence of the albuminuria, 
owever, will give rise to a pathological pro- 
;ss as a result of morbid functional irrita- 
on, which begins with simple hyperemia 
id intertubular haemorrhage, and progresses 
I chronic nephritis with all the characteris- 
; cs of the great white kidney. 

In addition to the effects cited, the injec- 
:ms of egg-albumen continued for a longer 
&gt;riod will induce a dyscrasic condition of 
re blood albuminoids, chiefly evidenced by 
ie pathological diffusibility which the serin 
jccessively attains in increasing measure. 

Thus far, chemistry has not been able to 
fow by what means is accomplished this 
(emico-molecular modification of the serin 
ithe presence of the injected and circulating 
(g-albumen (which in this case is a toxal- 
tmen); the experimental fact, however, can- 
rt be denied. Any one may readily convince 
rnself by measuring the coefficient of diffusi- 
tity of the serin before the experiment, and 
aain four or five weeks after the injections. 

In the same animal, and related to this 
unification of the diffusibility of the serin, 
niy be observed a progressive increase in 
m quantity of albumen excreted through the 
tfne; when the injections have been contin- 
ul for three or four weeks, this quantity is 
djble that of the injected egg-albumen. 

Those who still cling to the error of associ- 
ang albuminuria with nephritis in the neces- 
s;y relation of cause and effect, will doubt- 
ta explain the foregoing facts on the theory 
tKt the albuminuria is to be regarded simply 
fca consequence of the nephritis produced 
b the excretion of the injected egg- albumen; 
ail yet, as I proved five years since, there is 



no causal relation between the experimental 
or clinical lesions of the kidneys and the ex- 
creted quantity of albumen, — hence the con- 
siderable increase of the eliminated albumen 
during the experiments mentioned must be 
ascribed exclusively to the chemico-molecu- 
lar modification (diffusibility) which has been 
accomplished in the normal serin on contact 
with the egg- albumen, or, in other words, to 
a true dyscrasic condition of the composition 
of the blood. 

By administration of cantharidine and mer- 
sury salts, I found experimentally that the 
quantity of albumen excreted in cantharidine- 
nephritis is slight in comparison with the 
gravity of the renal alteration; whereas with 
the toxic renal inflammations induced by 
mercury the renal lesion is far less grave 
and the quantity of excreted albumen much 
larger. This may be explained by the fact 
that the modifying action of the mercury on 
the chemico-molecular constituents of the 
blood albuminoids is brought to bear inde- 
pendently of the development of the renal pro- 
cess. Again, recent experiments strengthen 
the position assumed by me (Archives de 
Physiologie) in 1881-1884, that the funda- 
mentalpathological condition for the passage 
of albumen through the kidney is the morbid 
diffusibility of the serin, which constitutes a 
true and peculiar dyscrasia in morbus Brightii, 
as a primary aetiological condition — as a sine 
qua non of this affection and of many other 
morbid conditions such as certain retardations 
of metamorphosis, chronic inorganic intoxica- 
tions, etc. The latest researches of Freund 
into the alterations of the blood in Bright's 
albuminuria have also in a large measure 
corroborated my discovery of the diffusibility 
of serin in the circulation of those suffering 
from this malady, and likewise my theory of 
the hematogenic or dyscrasic pathogenesis 
of Bright's disease. 

Clinics and autopsies daily teach that the 
albuminuria which is very frequently observed 
intra vitam is not correlated with any form of 
histological lesion in the kidney; and I have 
repeatedly called attention to a pathological 
error which is frequently encountered in 
practice — viz., systematic assumption of a 
nephritis because a little albumen makes its 
appearance in the urine. I am even satisfied 
that in the majority of cases, such as in acute

sea from modification in the diffus- 

ibility of the serin, this in turn having beei 
caused by alteration in the chemico-molecular 
blood-crasis. The objection sometimes made 
that in all the* U is distinctly 

shown by the clinic, in conjunction with a 
hematogenic or dyscrasic albuminuria — a 
nephritis may also exist, goes for nothing, 
since the latter supervenes in consequence of 
the action of the same general diathetic in- 
fluence on the arteries (arterio-sclerosis), or 
of the action of the albuminuria itself on the 
secretory apparatus. The portion of albu- 
men which proceeds from the nephritis in 
the first case is minimal (0.03 to 0.05 per cent.), 
and can be observed when with the renal 
arterio-sclerosis no general dyscrasic con- 
dition (such as arterious nephritis, gouty 
nephritis following uric deposits, etc.) is con- 
joined; whereas the quantity of the excreted 
albumen when there is a dyscrasic state of 
the blood and when the latter is the primary 
morbid factor, may rise to three, four, five, 
and even to fifteen and twenty grammes per 
liter, as is most strikingly shown in Bright's 
dyscrasia. For this very reason a nitrogen- 
ous diet augments the quantity of albumen, 
as I have repeatedly and experimentally 
shown. 

By continuing the subcutaneous injections 
of egg-albumen, albuminuric retinitis is pro- 
duced, — even during life the animals exhibit 
an appreciable weakening of the vision. On 
examining the retina, De Vincentis observed 
the development of very characteristic lesions 
— a more or less diffused turbidity of the 
retina, especially in the pyropapillary region. 
The microscope, in the case of animals sub- 
jected for seven or eight weeks to injections 
of egg-albumen, revealed distinct hyper- 
trophy of the retinal neuroglia, with multipli- 
cation of the nuclei of the connective tissue. 
Corresponding with the nuclear layers, this 
hypertrophy of the connective tissue had 
produced an appreciable prolongation of the 
radial fibres, the latter rising above the level 
of the external layers. 

I have frequently observed the phases of 
regressive alteration — be it in the form of 
fatty degeneration or of hyaline degenera- 
tion — in the elements of the retina, predomi- 



natingly in the layer of the external nuclei, 
and at times also in the layer of the thick 
ganglionic elements. Hen and there can be 
observed, between the individual retinal laj 
era, hyaline masses produced from the coaj 
lation of the inflammatory exudate. In 01 
case 1 was able to determine the presence 
small point-like haemorrhages from the reti. 
nal vessels. 

From the foregoing it may be concluded] 
that it is possible to induce Bright's dise; 
artificially, and characterized by the folloi 
ing peculiarities: albuminuria; second: 
nephritis; dyscrasic condition of the bl&lt; 
with diffusibility of the serin, hence with pr 
gressire augmentation of the quantity 
albumen excreted; serous infiltrate in tl 
urine; progressive diminution in the quantity 
of urates; albuminocholia — which during life 
may also be shown by the presence of albums 
in the faeces; hepatic inflammations; char, 
teristic retinitis. Indeed, at the present time 
no disease may be reproduced so completely 
in an experimental manner, and is thereforesc 
admirably suited to illumination in its path&lt; 
genie mechanism, as Bright's albuminuria 
The deficiency which really exists, and which 
will never be filled by the labors of the lab- 
oratory, is, the lack of the knowledge of the 
mechanism through which Bright's albumin- 
uria is spontaneously developed; in otrn 
words, we do not know what those functiona 
disturbances are, in consequence of whicl 
the albuminoids of the food become grad 
ually and slowly modified in their chemico 
molecular constitution, and rendered unas' 
similable, that is, unsuited to metamorphosi.' 
(as a sequel there is diminution of urates, o 1 
the regressive products, and of the toxicity 
the urine), conditioning a general dy- 
state whose first effect is a disease process hj 
the kidneys, precisely because these organs, ii 
consequence of the forced and providentia 
excretion of a toxalbumen, are most exposec 
to injury. Unfortunately this very ignoranc 
includes the physiological factor, for we 
thus far quite in the dark as to the phases

albumen is made capable of appropriation in 
the process of nutrition. 

The foregoing renders it superfluous to 
dwell on the therapeutic deductions which 
jnay be drawn from a general view of the 
Pathogenesis of albuminuria — deductions 
which, as J have repeatedly asserted, may 
ead to surprising remedial results, especially 
vhen rational treatment is instituted during 
he early history of the disease. The aim of 
men treatment to the intelligent and con- 
cientious physician must be the progressive 
mprovement of the activities of metamor- 
phosis, without even dreaming — and this 
leems to be the chief purpose of the deluded 
advocates of the nephrogenetic theory — of 
ombating the excretion of albumen, since 
he latter process in Bright's disease always 
epresents the beneficent and providential 
limination of a fundamental substance which 
as become heterogeneous and toxic.

EREBRAL TUMOR IN A CHILD OF EIGHT 
YEARS. 

BY J. WILLIAMS, JR., M.D. 

i Some six months since a lady consulted me 
jgarding her son, aged eight years, who 
roved to be suffering from strabismus and 
so motor paralysis of the entire left side — 
■lie face excepted. She had first observed 
rie squint some three weeks previously, but 
iing busy had neglected to consult a physi- 
an. The day before I was consulted, while 

play the child fell, and the motor paralysis 
iiddenly succeeded. He did not strike his 
;ad, nor did he give evidence of having re- 
eved any injury from the accident. 

I found there was convergent squint of the 
ft eye; the field of vision unimpaired; the 
].pil normal in size and in response to light 
Id shade. The motor paralysis of the left 
an and leg was almost complete; the fingers 
tuld be moved slightly, but the arm could 
It be raised to any extent; the left leg could 
tf t be moved except in a swinging motion. 
r ie muscles of the face and tongue were not 
c ected. Sensation was normal over the en- 
tie body; patellar reflexes and ankle clonus 
I affected. He suffered no pain. Temper- 
cire 99. 5 ; pulse 72 to 76, small and tense. 



The skin was the seat of a peculiar hot, burn- 
ing feeling. 

The little lad talked a great deal more than 
usual; gave utterance to many bright and 
witty things; appeared perfectly happy, and 
said he felt very well. His words, how- 
ever, were prolonged, and there was partial 
deafness of the left ear. No nausea or vom- 
iting; appetite normal. The affected muscles 
responded both to the galvanic and to the 
faradic current. 

I was unable at this time to make out a 
satisfactory diagnosis, but as the days went 
by and there was no apparent improvement 
in the condition I became convinced of the 
existence of a cerebral tumor, and advised 
that a specialist be consulted, which was 
finally acceded to and the boy taken to Doctor 
David Inglis, of Detroit, who, after careful 
examination, confirmed my diagnosis, in addi- 
tion locating the tumor in one of the crura. 

The patient had now remained in about 
the same condition for about eight weeks; 
and he so continued until the ninth week, 
when vomiting set in, along with obstinate 
constipation and occasional attacks of occip- 
ital headache lasting for several hours; when 
the bowels were moved by enema, marked 
prostration and vomiting followed. The urine 
was normal at all times. The temperature 
remained between 99. 5 and 100.5 through- 
out the whole sickness. The skin retained 
the peculiar pungent feeling, but when the 
child was bathed the moisture on the skin 
disappeared instantly. 

About this time the child, without being 
told, seemed to realize that he would not re- 
cover, and gave his mother minute directions 
in regard to his funeral. He gradually failed, 
and finally died from exhaustion sixteen 
w r eeks after the paralysis first occurred. The 
mental faculties were perfect up to a few 
hours before death. 

Post-mortem examination revealed a small, 
hard nodule encapsulated by a tumor of semi- 
solid nature one and a half inches in diame- 
ter, situate in the substance of the left 
hemisphere, at the beginning of the crus, and 
in turn surrounded by a yellow creamy fluid; 
there was likewise marked increase in the 
amount of cerebral fluid. The external sur- 
face of the brain after the skull-cap was re- 
moved presented nothing abnormal as to

shape or size, and it was only after cutting 
into the substance of the brain itself that the 
tumor \va red. 

I am unable to obtain any history of 
sumption or specific n parents or 

grandparents; the former were healthy ei 
cept that tiie mother had occasional attacks 
Sthma. The mother had three other 
children, all of whom are living and healthy; 
she could afford no clue to the malady further 
than to recall the fact that for the past year 
the lad had complained a great deal of being 
tired and sleepy, and very often on coming 
home from school would throw himself on the 
bed and say, "Oh ! mamma, I am so sleepy." 

This case was of marked interest to me, 
and may interest some other members of the 
profession. Certainly a cerebral tumor in a 
child so young is not usual; and as there was 
no history of an injury to the head, its cause 
will remain a mystery. The tumor — as well 
as the paralysis which undoubtedly was 
secondary thereto — was on the left side. 
There was no wasting of the muscles of the 
affected side, and sensation was not impaired.

SUPERNUHERARY TESTIS. 

Editor Medical Age: 

Under the date of April 25th of the current 
year (page 256) you publish an account of 
a case of supernumerary testis. A few days 
after perusing this I was confronted by a 
similar case, in a young man aged twenty 
years, who consulted me regarding an annoy- 
ing "round lump " in the left scrotum. This 
was first observed some five years since, and 
— he thought — had recently increased slightly 
in size. 

Examination revealed a small body about 
the size of a hazel nut, presenting the charac- 
teristics of a true testicle, situate a little 
above the normal gland of the same side. 
There was but one left spermatic cord, but 
the supernumerary testicle appeared to be 
connected therewith by a branch of the cord 
or a band of fibrous tissue. Pressure upon 



the supernumerary body gave the game pain- 
ful sensation as \va&gt; d&lt; I by like man- 
ipulation of its fellow, and it was more quickly 
retracted than the latter by cremasteric reflex. 
The right testicle wafl somewhat larger than 
its normal fellow.

PECULIAR DEATH FROM CHLOROFORM 

Editor Medii \i Age: 

On April 6th, a boy aged twelve, hearty 
and robust-looking, was given chloroform in 
order to facilitate amputation of the little : 
finger. He was placed in a recumbent pos 
ture and a few inhalations of the anaesthetic 
were taken, when it was suspended in order 
to twist the napkin employed into the fori 
of a cup. Perhaps half a minute after su 
pension of the anaesthetic the boy started up, 
turned upon his abdomen, and endeavored I 
get off the couch, when he gave evidence 01 
suspended animation. He was immediately 
carried into the hallway, his tongue pulled 
out, rectum dilated, and every means taken 
toward resuscitation; finally, artificial respi- 
ration was resorted to for an hour, but in 
vain. 

This case is worthy of note from the fact 
it is extremely rare that a child succumbs tQ 
chloroform.

DEHISE OF THE INDEX MEDICUS. 

The discontinuance of the Index Medicus is 
announced. This will be a sad blow to the 
coterie of authors and editors who have 
i r ound its columns so satisfying a resource in 
furthering their labors in the interests of 
'nedical and surgical literature and science. 
The Medical Age had hoped this monthly 
Vould be sustained by those in whose in- 
terest solely it has been published, but it 
ippears these hopes were not to be realized. 
Those familiar with the history of the Index 
Medicus are aware it has for a decade been 
mblished at an annual deficit of hundreds 
&gt;f dollars; that it has been carried by its 
publisher in a most unselfish way, simply 
.s a tribute to progressive medical science. 
But even a voluntary tribute, when it rolls 
ip into the thousands, becomes a burden- 
ome tax which no individual, however public- 
pirited or generous, can afford to carry. 
In October last the medical profession was 
otified the publisher of the Index Medicus 
lid not feel it incumbent upon him to sustain 
Dnger a journal which was apparently little 
ppreciated by those in whose interest it was 
ublished; thereupon a few urged its continu- 
nce, pledging a support that would at least 
iduce the annual deficit to $500; but these 
ledges have not been redeemed, and sus- 
ension became inevitable. This is greatly 
) be deplored, as the Index Medicus is es- 
mtial to the Index Catalogue of the Library 
■f the Surgeon General's Office. The first 
Mume of the latter was issued in 1880, and 
tere is no means of making volume one 



equally available for reference with volume 
sixteen, now in press, except through the 
former. Volume sixteen closes the Cata- 
logue, and now, with the suspension of the 
Index Medicus, the value of the former is 
greatly impaired for future years, and it is 
only a matter of time when it will become 
practically obsolete. 

That attempts may be made in the future 
to revive the Index Medicus, or at least to 
provide a substitute therefor, is not improba- 
ble; but the hiatus that will obtain will be 
highly detrimental to science and authorship. 
Further, the present editors of the Index 
Medicus will not be available, since one has 
already entered upon a new field of labor, 
and the other will not be apt to again tempt 
the caprices of an unappreciative medical 
public. 

We say frankly, the suspension of this most 
valuable periodical is a national misfortune; 
it is moreover a disgrace to the medical pro- 
fession of the country, inasmuch as it evi- 
dences that few of the 106,000 practitioners 
within the United States are interested in 
elevating their calling — not enough, in fact, 
to form a respectable battalion. Eheu, Eheu ! 



HIGH ART AND THE DAILY PRESS. 

The daily press is especially strong on 
illustration. The facility with which old 
"cuts" are worked over and over and made 
to do duty for anything and everything, from 
a Bushman in South Africa to the Premier of 
a European monarchy, surpasseth all under- 
standing. 

During the recent session of the American 
Medical Association in Baltimore, the press 
of that city essayed to do great honor to the 
notables in attendance. Doctor Donald 
Maclean, the ex-President, his polished 
sinciput adorned with an old-time bag-wig 
shorn of its pig-tail attachment, was held up 
to view "deciding a point of order." 

Admitting such procedure may be very 
enterprising journalism in Baltimore, in this 
particular instance it is not especially flatter- 
ing to Detroit. The latter city has always 
evinced pride in the fact that a man of such 
distinguished presence and reputation as 
Doctor Maclean resides within its borders, 
but when the Baltimore American insists upon

reducing his six feet of Stature to something 
approaching four feet three, and ornament- 
ing his head with a second-hand, rat-nipped. 
horse-hair w g sil inches thick, we fail ti 

predate the compliment. 

We also observe that the same "cut" 
which did duty in the Baltimore American s 
columns at the time of the Pan-American 
the counterfeit presentment of 
1 V Love, ol St. Louis, is now labeled 
Lester H. Montgomery, of Chicago. Not 
being personally acquainted with Doctor 
Montgomery, it remains an open question 
who is the person flattered, the gentleman of 
the Mound City or the one residing on the 
shores of Lake Michigan. 

Considering the general character of news- 
paper pen and pencil portraits, it for some 
years has been a wonder to The Medical 
Agi that there are not more cases of "justi- 
fiable homicide." 



ABSENCE OF EPIGLOTTIS. 

Doctor Thomas Hubbard, of Toledo, Ohio, 
reports the unique case of a German woman, 
aged thirty-five years, in whom laryngoscopic 
examination showed the epiglottis to be ab- 
sent — or rather, only a small strip of this 
organ remained, about one centimeter in 
breadth and about half a centimeter in 
length; the upper margin was somewhat 
granular, and at the edges angular. Though 
there was some tension of the lateral epiglot- 
tic folds, the intra-laryngeal structures ap- 
peared normal in their relations. The mucous 
membranes over the arytenoids were some- 
what thickened and hyperemia 

Since syphilis, congenital or acquired, was 
excluded, Doctor Hubbard surmised that this 
condition of the epiglottis was of recent date 
and probably a sequel to tuberculosis, or pos- 
sibly lupus. 



RARE ANT1PODEAL POISONS. 

" Nature, having made all sorts of useful 
animals and birds for other parts of the 
world," said Sydney Smith, "seemed deter- 
mined, when supplying life for Australasia, 
to give free play to her fancy, and accord- 
ingly made cherries with the stones outside; 
a monstrous animal as tall as a grenadier, 



with a tail like a bedpost, hopping along at 
the rate of three hops to a mile, with several 
young ones looking out of its false u:

bill of a duck, which agitated Sir J&lt; 
Hanks and rendered him miserable from his 
utter inability to decide whether it was a bird 
or a beast." 

A very interesting anniversary address 
recently delivered before the Royal Society 
of New South Wales by Doctor And( 
Stuart, in which he dealt with certain crea- 
tures that possess some interest for physi- 
cians. Regarding Ornithorhynchui paradoxmm 
he remarked it was for a long time considered 
to be quite harmless and destitute of any 
weapon of offense, although the hind legs of 
males were armed with a powerful spur, ap- 
parently connected with a gland, which was 
later believed to be a weapon allied to the 
armory of snakes, scorpions, and bees, all of 
which possess a sort of hypodermic poison 
syringe. Doctor Stuart determined, if possi- 
ble, to solve this question; and he gives inde- 
pendent accounts, which coincide perfectly, 
and from them concludes that at certain sea- 
sons the spur secretion of the Ornithorhynchus 
is virulently poisonous. The mode of attack 
is not by scratching, but by lateral inward 
movements of the hind legs. A dog was 
"stung" three times, the symptoms much re- 
sembling those from bee or hornet poison, the 
animal evincing drowsiness and great pain, 
but no tremors, convulsions, or staggering. 
It is worthy of note that a certain immunity 
seems obtainable, for the animal suffered less 
on the second occasion and still less on the 
third. Two men were w r ounded, in both of 
whom the symptoms were the same as in the 
dog. No deaths are reported in human 
beings, though four occurred in dogs. 

Another poisonous creature is the red- 
backed spider — Lathrodectus, — though the 
variety found in the neighborhood of Sydney, 
N.S.W., is not so virulent as the Lathrodtctus 
decempunctatus from which Professor Robert 
obtained a poison so powerful that ^ grain 
would kill a man of 150 pounds weight 
Many instances of fatal results from the bite 
of these spiders are recorded. 

Another pest, very fatal to dogs, is a form 
of wood or bush tick. In this case also one 
attack confers immunity from a second, and

in districts where this parasite abounds dogs 
are frequently made immune by permitting 
the tick to remain until the first poison symp- 
toms appear, and then removing it, repeating 
again and again upon recovery. 



EDITORIAL NOTES. 



Redivivus.— 

In the early fifties a patient, while waiting 
in the office of the late Doctor Pope of St. 
Louis, gave vent to his feelings by scribbling 
the following on a convenient blotter: 

When sorrow's cloud is cast athwart 

The sunshine of my mind, 
When I, with gloomy care distraught, 

No recreation find; 
When sighing o'er my helpless lot, 

And what I used to be, 
I'll seek some quiet tranquil spot 

And pass a small bougie. 

Let strictures on my conduct pass; 

Unnoticed let them be; 
A stricture somewhere else, alas ! 

Is more deplored by me. 
In hope this blight on manhood's bloom 

I yet effaced may see, 
I'll hie me to my quiet room 

And pass a small bougie. 

This the Columbus Medical Journal recently 
rescued from almost oblivion, accrediting to 
'Erichsen's Rhymes." It, however, origin- 
ally appeared in the Peninsular Medical 
Journal of Detroit, when that journal was 
tinder the editorial guidance of the late 
Moses Gunn, and was subsequently copied in 
i;he Boston Medical and Surgical Journal. 
The Peninsular Journal died in 1859, though 
mother periodical of the same name was 
published for a brief period at Ann Arbor. 

The American Medical Association.— 

The Baltimore session which closed a few 
lays since was one of the most successful of 
he annual gatherings of this Association. 

The officers for 1896 are: President, Doctor 
I. Beverly Cole, of San Francisco, Cal.; First 
/ice-President, Doctor J. J. Chisolm, of 
Baltimore; Second Vice-President, Doctor 
ohn C. Legrand, of Alabama; Third Vice- 
resident, Doctor Augustus P. Clark, of 
Massachusetts; Fourth Vice-President, Doc- 
or T. P. Satterwhite, of Kentucky; Treas- 
rer, Doctor Henry P. Newman, of Illinois; 
ecretary, Doctor W. B. Atkinson, of Penn- 
ylvania; Librarian, Doctor G. W. Wise, of 



Illinois. Members of the Board of Trustees: 
Alonzo Garcelon, of Maine; Doctor I. N. 
Love, of Missouri; Doctor James E. Reeves, 
of Tennessee. The members of the Judicial 
Council are: N. S. Davis, Illinois; H. A. 
Didama, New York; John Morris, Maryland; 
W. E. B. Davis, Alabama; George W. Broome, 
Illinois; D. W. Smouse, Iowa; M. B. Ward, 
Kansas; William M. Welch, Pennsylvania. 

At the next annual meeting, at Atlanta, 
Georgia, Nicholas Senn will deliver the ad- 
dress on Surgery, William Osier that on Gen- 
eral Medicine, and Geo. H. Rohe that on 
State Medicine. 

Higher Education for Pharmacists.— 

This was the subject of a most able paper 
presented in the Pharmacy Section of the 
American Medical Association by Professor 
Joseph P. Remington. He declared the 
pharmacist "must ever be the intelligent 
coadjutor of the physician; and that in the 
higher education in the colleges of pharmacy, 
laboratory instruction plays an important 
part." Professor Caspari supplemented this 
with the statement: "In many stores the 
drug clerk gets more experience in selling 
garden seed, paints, and coal-oil, than any- 
thing else; yet with such experience a man 
gets a diploma as Doctor of Pharmacy, while 
the laboratory student gets only a certificate 
as Pharmaceutical Chemist." 

Physiology and the Public Schools.— 

Professor Michael Foster — and it will be 
difficult to find any better authority — urges 
that the study of physiology beyond the mere 
elements is impossible without previous ad- 
equate knowledge of chemistry and physics; 
that if the study is to be real, the whole body 
must be dealt with, no parts being excluded 
for special reasons, — and this means the real 
study cannot be taken up until after puberty. 
He concludes that for these reasons it seems 
to be undesirable to press the introduction of 
physiology into schools as an educational 
subject, since by the time a boy or girl is 
thus prepared to study this topic it is time 
that he or she should leave school. 

The Root of the Hatter.— 

During a discussion by the American Medi- 
cal Association, of proprietary remedies and 



I 






THE MEDICAL AGE. 



the advertising of same in the A 
journal, Doctor I'. J Connor pertinently re- 
marked that if the members would refuse to 

ribe proprietaries they could cons 
tiously oppose the publication of such adver- 
tisements. He moved that a commit'' 
three- be appointed to ascertain how many 
members of the Association were accustomed 
to prescribing proprietary remedies. 

Medical Advertisements in the Journal of the 
A. M. A.— 

The American Medical Association has 
decided that no advertisements of medicinal 
preparations can hereafter be inserted in the 
Association journal — after the expiration of 
present contracts — unless the exact working 
formula of the preparation appears in the 
advertisement. 

This certainly is a step in advance and a 
resolution that has long been desired by the 
better class of medical men. 

Remarkable If True.— 

A "doctor" who died in St. Louis on April 
ist was said to have reached his one hun- 
dred and fortieth year. Doctor A. J. Buck 
declares that the Masonic record of Doctor 
Hotchkiss has been traced back one hun 
dred years, showing that he must have 
reached one-and-twenty years more than a 
century ago. A letter received from his old 
home in Virginia over a year ago declares 
that he was born there in 1755. 

Pterygium.— 

Doctor Bay lis, in the Memphis Medical 
Journal, declares he has "seen four cases of 
pterygium apparently cured by the use of a 
bichloride-of-mercury eye-wash (1 to 4000) 
containing cocaine and morphine." 

A method very satisfactory in the majority 
of instances is, touching the pterygium daily 
with a camel hair brush laden with wine of 
opium. 

A Book on Cats. — 

Another valuable addition will shortly be 
made to veterinary literature, under this 
title and the authorship of Professor R. S. 
Huidekoper. It promises general informa- 
tion of much worth, including classification, 
varieties and care of feline diseases. It will 
be profusely illustrated. 






New Micro-organism in Pork.— 

Doctor Frank J. Thornbury, of Buffalo, 

announces a new micro-organism, 

group," which he denominates Sac- 
ckaromyces porcus. He apparently considers 
meat containing it dangerous, as it destroys 
white mice and rats twenty-four hours after 
inoculation. 



Facilis Descensus.— 

The Great Retired has mysteriously dis 
appeared from the list of members of the 
faculty of the New York Post-Graduate. This 
fact, in connection with "animal extracts" 
prepared in his "own laboratory," under 
"direct supervision," etc, is most broadly 
suggestive. 












Four Years of Medical Study.— 

At the meeting of the American Medical 
College Association in Baltimore, it was de- 
cided by a vote of twenty-nine to five that f 
four years' course of study should be de- 
manded of all students henceforth matricu- 
lating in institutions belonging to this organ- 
ization. 

A White Panther.— 

Recently arrived at the Jardin des Plantes, 
Paris, an albino panther, which is certainly a 
great novelty. This is not the cougar or cat- 
amount (Felis concolor) which obtains the title 
of panther in the United States, but the albino 
of the black creature peculiar to the East 
Indies. 

Professor Thomas Huxley.— 

Some eleven weeks since Doctor Huxley 
was seized with influenza, and latterly his 
illness became critical. There was a period 
of ten days when his survival was doubtful. 
We are happy to announce that he is now, 
apparently, on the high road to convales- 
cence. 

Corsets. — 

Marchland says gallstones in women are 
not unfrequent sequel to the pernicious hat 
of tight lacing. 

Bacteria and Cold.— 

According to Pictet, a temperature as loi 
as -4 1 5. 5 F. fails to destroy any form of 
bacterium.

Items and News. 



Supposed Rabies.— 

The Bishop of Cork, the Right Reverend 
Doctor Meade, and his coachman, have gone 
together to Professor Pasteur, having been 
bitten by a little terrier dog. That the ani- 
mal showed at the time no evidence of being 
mad, may be judged from the fact that for 
five days the Bishop did not even consider it 
necessary to consult a surgeon. Neverthe- 
less, a veterinary surgeon was called to in- 
spect, and he committed the usual blunder of 
ordering the dog to be destroyed, which was 
done. We are glad to believe that neither 
the worthy and highly respected Bishop nor 
his coachman is in any danger of hydropho- 
bia. There is not a scintilla of proof, as far 
as we can judge from the reports, that the 
animal was rabid, and, if it were, the five 
days which elapsed would certainly have put 
the fact beyond doubt. But the time-honored 
folly of destroying the dog was committed, 
and thus all possibility of proving the 
negative and relieving the apprehensions of 
relatives and friends was lost. Surely the 
veterinary numbskull would have lost noth- 
ing and gained much by locking the dog up 
and awaiting symptoms. We assume that 
ithis snappish cur will be recorded by the 
:Veterinar.y Department of Dublin Castle as 
mad, along with the hetacomb of other dogs 
batoned to death by ignorant people because 
;the poor animals hung their tongues out and 
ran frantically from the pursuing mob. — 
Medical Press and Circular. 

The State Stands Aside.— 

The "social purity" abnormalities of Lon- 
ion succeeded in inducing the hysterically 
•eligious Viceroy of India to order the abo- 
rtion of registration of prostitutes. The 
Lancet recently cited some terrible results of 
his, among others the case of a young Can- 
onese girl who tried to commit suicide be- 
cause one of her brothers, a speculator in 
laves, threatened to sell her to another 
mother, also a speculator in slaves. In 
peaking of this case The Lancet says that 
ince the system of State protection has been 
•bandoned the only possible release for these 
•oor creatures is death. Labouchere, who 
'oints to this (in Truth) as an illustration of 
he folly of well meaning women and silly 
len, says an officer high in command in the 
rmy in India gives him data of the most 
tartling character, the conclusion of which 
&gt; that out of 71,000 British troops in India, 
ver 23,000 are regularly rendered useless 



from one cause alone. The effective strength 
of the army is thus reduced in numbers be- 
low 48,000. In view of these facts Labou- 
chere logically asks: "Can those who have 
allowed disease full play, and consequently 
involved the Empire in peril, suggest any 
way out of the difficulty?" — Medical Standard. 

Gallic Rubbish.— 

It is reported that great consternation has 
been stirred up in aristocratic circles in Paris 
by the discovery of an infallible law by which 
children may trace their parents, and deter- 
mine especially who their father is. Usually 
the mother is more easily traced than the 
father. The savant who made this discovery 
is overwhelmed with requests to apply it in 
the cases of individuals who are anxious 
about their parentage, and is also threatened 
with every imaginable punishment if he does 
not keep it a close secret, or if he applies it 
or allows it to be applied in such investiga- 
tions. — The Sun. 

Words of Wisdom.— 

When a bacteriological diagnosis, in the 
absence of any clinical evidence of the dis- 
ease, can agonize the hearts of parents and 
friends in a private dwelling, then that bac- 
teriological diagnosis becomes a cruel guide 
and a sin against humanity. When the bac- 
teriological diagnosis, in the absence of any 
clinical evidence of the disease, can force the 
helpless and defenseless poor into a hospital 
for contagious diseases, to be subjected to a 
treatment about which we know nothing, 
then it becomes a crime. — American Medico- 
Chirurgical Bulletin. 

Asphyxia in the New=born. — 

A writer in a Paris journal treats this con- 
dition by seizing the tongue of the child with 
forceps and making rhythmical traction, al- 
ternating by allowing the tongue to fall back. 
By this method natural breathing is estab- 
lished in ten minutes. One case is quoted 
where, in spite of the use of ordinary methods 
for one hour and a half, breathing was not 
established. In the last moment this method 
was used, and in a short time the child 
breathed naturally. — University Medical Mag- 
azine. 

Creosote in Phthisis.— 

Though reports are generally favorable, 
still Creosote often fails. Give two drops 
three times a day, increasing slowly till the 
bowels are irritated; the dose may in this way 
be carried up to ninety or one hundred drops. 
It is contra-indicated when fever occurs. It

ton. 

This is one of the most remarkable, and at 
the same time most interesting, of the orni- 
thological works devoted to the feathered 
inhabitant^ of North America. The local 
nation of the volume is, however, mis- 
; nee there are few species described 
that are not to be found in the greater por- 
tion of the United States east of the Missis- 
sippi, and in Ontario and portions of Quebec. 
Another remarkable thing in connection with 
the volume is that while written by a youth 
of seventeen with almost no outside help, for 
twenty years it has been ranked among the 
authorities on the subject of which it treats. 
Mr. William Brewster, who edits this second 
edition (Henry I ). Minot died November 14th, 
189c), remarks the popularity of the volume 
" is due partly to the large amount of original 
matter which it contains, partly to the pleasant 
style in which it is written, and in no small de- 
gree to the attractive personality of Mr. Minot 
himself." Most of the biographies relate to

Surgical Pathology and Therapeutics. By Jo 
C. Warren, M.D. Cloth; large 8vo; pp. 8&lt; 
Price, $6.00. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia. 

The science of surgical pathology has loi 
since overgrown the limits of space which 
be allotted to it in text-books of surgery. 

Since the publication of Billroth's woi 
upon this topic, there has been nothing satii 
factory in character offered the medical pi 
fession until the present volume, which 
coming from the source it does, is most au- 
thoritative. It treats of a majority of tl 
morbid processes encountered by the Mir 
geon: of hyperemia, inflammation, repa 
processes, gangrene, shock, fever, septicseml 
pyaemia, erysipelas, tetanus, actinomycosis 
anthrax, tuberculosis, diseases of bone, anc 
tumors. Special attention is given also 
antiseptic surgery. The author associates as 
closely as possible pathological condition: 
with the treatment and symptoms of surgica 
diseases. Indeed, the volume may be wel 
termed a modern medical classic, for such 
the position to which it has already risen.

Edward L. Wilson, New York. 

Mr. Wilson has succeeded in producing the 
lost comprehensive reference book in its 
lass in any language. Some idea of its scope 
lay be had when it is understood that there 
re 2,500 references upon different subjects 
onnected with the theory and practice of 
hotography. By connecting the various 
Terences upon any selected subject it will 
e found that this volume constitutes a con- 
ise manual of chemistry, optics, manipula- 
on, reproduction, art terms, formulas, and 
lethods applied in photographic practice. — 
'he historical references are unusually com- 
lete. Moreover, the book is profusely illus- 
rated, well printed, substantially bound, and 
p to date on all subjects. It is a volume 
lvaluable to all interested in photography, 
whether amateurs or Drofessionals.

Therapeutic Brevities. 



I'his is the I

18 first given one-half to one 

gran. ;n, and tl i idly inert 

until at the end of the first week he is taking 

. . in closes of from 
one to four grains. A: the end of 
the Opium is entirely suspended, and Sodium 
half drachm four times d 
:uted. After these large doses of bro- 
mide have been continued for some time, the 
amou lually lowered until the patient 

3 than forty grains a day. It is 
important that the bromide should immedi- 
ately follow the suspension of the large d 
ium. 
The plan, however, is not a specific in the 
treatment of epilepsy, but in almost every 
in which it has been tried there has been 
D of the fits for a greater or less 
time. A relapse generally occurs in a period 
rig from a few weeks to a few months. 
The frequency of fits after the exhibition 
urn is, for the first year at least, les- 
sened more than one half. The attacks occur- 
ring after the relapse are much less severe in 
character than those that the patient had been 
accustomed to. 

This treatment is particularly valuable in 
ancient and intractable cases, but in recent 
of idiopathic epilepsy it cannot be rec- 
ommended. Jt is an important adjuvant to 
the bromide plan as ordinarily applied. 

The Opium acts symptomatically, and 
merely prepares the way for and enhances 
the activity of the bromides and other thera- 
peutic measures; it also permits the use of 
any other substances which have a beneficial 
action in epilepsy. — Doctor COLLINS, in 
ical Record. 



The Therapy of Phlebotomy. — Diagnosis has 
been rather overcultivated; the secret pro- 
3 of deranged physiology have been 
well mastered, but on the side of therapeu- 
tics we have lagged far behind. Too much 
time has been spent on pathology, and not 
enough given to the clinical side of medicine. 

What proportion of American graduates 
how to perform a venesection, to cup 
and scarify, or apply leeches? Probably 
none are taught these in their student course; 
yet, who that has any practical knowledge of 
the effects of the abstraction of blood can 
deny its marvellous potency ? The vener- 
able Verneuil lately declared, in the French 
Academy, that since the lancet and wet-cups 



have- been cast aside in pleurisy, and tl 
ne into use. the mortality hi 
enormously ased; from the early 

of this malady blood-letting. I&lt; geneq 

like magii And in the premonit 
i puerperal com 
with renal congestion, it is by all odds tl 
St and most reliable remedy. 
It has not been the use but the abuse 
blood-letting which has made it an DO pull 

the curse of medicine. In tl 

near past it was almost criminal to oper; 
without saturating the healthy nude 
with powerful irritants. The antisej 
theory was overdone. Let blood-letting 
revived, and employed with judgment ai 
discretion. — Times and Register. 



Urethral Injections. — The capacity of th&lt; 
urethra lias been estimated at from seventy- 
five minims to two drachms, therefore it 
generally held a urethral syringe should n&lt; 
be of greater capacity than one and one-hi 
drachms; but recently it has been shown tl 
posterior urethritis, particularly late in tl 
disease, is far more frequent than was for 
merly supposed. By experimenting on the 
living subject, it will be found the urethra 
will always hold two and a half, and often 
three to five drachms. 

Deep injections are demanded only when 
definite symptoms amply demonstrate th&lt; 
posterior urethra is involved in the urethritis; 
as the patient can always tell when the sphinc- 
ter is forced, this can be readily avoided. Tc 
administer, employ a syringe of five drachms 
capacity. When it is desired to overcome 
the sphincter vesicae, gentle pressure is made 
when the fluid will enter the bladder — I hav&lt; 
encountered but one case in which the sphinc- 
ter would not relax. It is better to give the 
injections when the patient is upon his back 
The requirement of an effective injection if 
that it shall reach the diseased parts, and tc 
secure this a syringe of not less than five- 
drachms' capacity is demanded, and the in- 
jection of the entire contents, if carefullj 
done, is easy and causes no inconvenience.— 
Guiard, in Annates des Maladies des Organe* 
Gin it( &gt; - Urin a ires . 



Bismuth in Large Doses. — The freque 
failure of bismuth in the treatment of gasti 
catarrh is due to the small doses usually ad- 
ministered. With doses of ten to twenty 
grains a certain proportion does not react 
the stomach for some time, being retained ii 
the mouth, pharynx, and oesophagus. 1 hi* 
consideration, and the fact that bismuth 
almost insoluble, and the danger of poison- 



I rig therefore very remote, demand the em- 
iloyment, in chronic catarrh, of much larger 
loses than is customary. In order to free 
he mucous membrane from adherent mucus, 
he patient should take in the morning, on 
n empty stomach, a teaspoonful or less of 
Carlsbad salt dissolved in about half a pint 
i warm water; half an hour later a teaspoon- 
ul well heaped up of the subcarbonate of 
&gt;ismuth in wafer paper — in two parts, the 

|&gt;ne after the other, as the quantity is rather 
arge to swallow at once. The gastric region 

. houfd then be treated to massage for a short 
ime, in order to bring the bismuth into as 
Jose apposition to the mucous membrane as 

gbossible, and half an hour after the dose 

•|&gt;reakfast may be taken. — -Doctor Pick, in 

\3er liner Klinische Wochenschrift. 



THE MEDICAL AGE.

Hydrocele. — Within recent years Bergman 
tas recommended the only reliable operation 
or the cure of hydrocele. An incision three 
o four inches long is made through the tis- 
;ues of the scrotum down to the parietal 
ayer of the tunica vaginalis. This is care- 
I'ully peeled out with the handle of a scalpel 
Iff goitre sound, leaving the sac still intact. 
The cavity is now laid open between two 
jlressing forceps and the parietal layer ex- 
cised, allowing only that portion which is 
i 'effected over the testicle and epididymis to 
remain. All bleeding vessels are ligated and 
f he cavity carefully mopped out. A drain- 
age tube or a strip of iodoform gauze is in- 
serted into the wound at its most dependent 
oortion, and the edges of the wound are 
carefully brought together by means of a 
continuous catgut suture; then an antiseptic 
dressing is applied, and the testicle kept ele- 
vated with a good-fitting suspensory bandage. 
The drainage material is removed on the 
: ourth or fifth day, and the patient allowed to 
jet up at the end of the second week. — Med- 
'cal Brief. 



Lancing Infant Gums. — In a paper recently 
read before the New York Medical Associa- 
tion, so good an authority as Doctor J. Lewis 
Smith protested emphatically against the 
practice of lancing infant gums. The belief 
still prevails to a wide extent that the cutting 
of teeth is a common cause not only of pain- 
ful gums and poor appetite, but also of entero- 
colitis and other serious maladies which are 
often allowed to run until beyond the skill of 
the physician. Our ancestors in the profes- 
sion are to blame for the widespread impres- 
sion that much disease is due to dentition, 
since at one time it was a common custom to 
incise the gums. We can well get along 



without any such operation, for if the gums 
are red and irritated there must be some 
other condition to account for this irritation. 
Finally, it is not rational to suppose that nor- 
mal dentition is to be interfered with any 
more than any other physiological process. — 
The Practitioner. 



Chancroid. — I cured one of the worst cases 
of chancroid I have seen for years, with 
Golden Seal. The parts were angry in ap- 
pearance, enormously swollen, the ulcer 
spreading, very painful; in fine, this was a 
forbidding case, one in every respect un- 
promising. In two days I changed the whole 
aspect to hopefulness and confidence by the 
local application of a strong decoction of 
Golden Seal root and the powdered root. 
The sore was washed out with the decoction, 
and then filled with the powder; a piece of 
lint, wet with the fluid, was then applied over 
the sore and kept in place with a small, light 
bandage, wetting the lint with the fluid every 
hour or two, night and day. The sore healed 
completely in two weeks. — Joseph Adolphus, 
in Georgia Eclectic. 



Menthol in Diphtheria. — F. Kastorsky re- 
ports thirty-seven cases of diphtheria (all but 
three in children) successfully treated by 
painting with a ten-per-cent. alcoholic solu- 
tion of Menthol. The paintings (by means 
of a piece of cotton wool) were usually car- 
ried out three times daily. In some cases, 
however, a single free application was fol- 
lowed by complete disappearance of false 
membranes within two days. A marked im- 
provement in the patient's general condition 
was invariably noticed from the beginning of 
the treatment. The same simple method was 
successfully practiced in numerous cases of 
anginas of various forms, and by Triitovsky 
in a group of cases of scarlatinal diphtheria. 
— British Medical Journal. 



Hot- Water Douches. — Doctor Baldy teaches 
that vaginal douches of hot water, as com- 
monly employed in pelvic or uterine inflam- 
mations, are positively harmful,— hot water 
used by the patient in the crouching position 
simply adds congestion to an already in- 
flamed part. To derive benefit from the hot 
water, the patient must be reclining, and* use 
not less than a full gallon at a temperature of 
105 to 1 io° F. Experience teaches that it is 
impossible to get dispensary patients to ob- 
serve these rules, and consequently douching 
is not ordered except for cleansing purposes.

is. — If both iron and manganese are 
indicated! do not give in conjunction, but 
separately and with hour intervals. The 
best preparation of the former is the muriate 
tincture, which may be disguised by adminis- 
tration in Seltzer water. Either the sulphate 
or carbonate of manganese may be employed, 
and preferably in pill form. The carbonate 
may be mixed with extract of gentian; the 
sulphate answers best when mixed with equal 
parts of iodide of potassium. — Twerokajhous 
Porokooskihoff. 



Morphine Hypodermatically. — It is neces- 
sary, after giving a hypodermatic injection 
of morphine, to maintain perfect silence in 
the room where the patient is lying. Mor- 
phine, far from suppressing sensitiveness, like 
chloroform, rather tends to exalt the excita- 
bility, and particularly the liability to dis- 
turbance from slight noises. The failure of 
morphine injections to produce sleep is, in 
the majority of instances, due to neglect of 
this simple precaution. — M. Huchard, in 
Lyon Medical. 



Convallaria. — This drug is capable of slow- 
ing the heart's action and of increasing blood- 
ire; it is valuable when the ventricles 
are over-distended and dilatation begins, 
when there is an absence of compensatory 
hypertrophy, and when venous stasis is 
marked. Convallaria acts more particularly 
on the right side of the heart, and digitalis 
on the left. Convallaria acts less favora- 
bly when albuminuria is present. — Doctor 
:&gt;t, in Pacific Coast Journal.

tonsillotomy is objectionable, chronic amyg- 
dalitis may be treated with applications of 
Iodine. The tincture in full strength or in

characterized by sessile granulations which 
bleed easily, is best treated by the very old 
method of applying Nitric Acid. Introduce

Medical Progress. 



An Epidemic of Smallpox in Little 
Thibet, and the Lama Method of " Vac- 
cination."*— Leh, the capital of the province 
of Ladak, under the rule and jurisdiction of 
the Maharajah of Kashmir, is an isolated 
village of 3,000 inhabitants, situated at an 
altitude of 12,000 feet in a valley one mile 
long and three-fourths broad, surrounded by- 
huge barren mountains. Being in the region 
of perpetual snow, the climate is always more 
or less rigorous — the minimum thermometer 
often registering -18 F.; nevertheless it is 
very dry, bracing, and salubrious, correspond- 
ing in some measure to that of Davos Platz. 
Phthisis is unknown in Ladak. 

The people are personally very filthy. The 
men wear the Chinese pig-tail, composed of 
natural hair plus additions of strings, rags, 
etc., to the 44 regulation " length; and this 
tail dangles on the back, making a dirty, 
black, greasy streak on the garment under- 
neath. Beneath the latter the Ladaki wears 
his clean or " best " suit. The women are all 
polyandrists; this fact, together with the 
bona fide celibacy of the Lama priests, main- 
tains an even balance between over-popula- 
tion and the production of the province. 

An epidemic of smallpox, broke out in the 
autumn of 1892, during my tenure of office in 
Leh. Only one previous epidemic, of short 
duration, had been known in the history of 
Leh, namely, that of 1877, and the disease 
was thought to have been stamped out. The 
exciting cause of the 1892 outbreak was, no 
doubt, in some measure due to the influx of 
Kashmiris just getting over the disease, hav- 
ing either caught it en route to Leh, or started 
from Kashmir with the disease on them, 
spreading it by means of loose scales from 
the scabs. Every third man in Kashmir is 
pitted, as during a smallpox epidemic no 
precautions are taken as to segregation, but 
the malady is simply left to run its own course, 
those attacked stoically resigning themselves 
to all consequences; not the slightest care is 
taken by either relatives or friends to amel- 
iorate or render more comfortable the ill and 
afflicted. 

The Kashmir influx into Leh is usually 
during the months of July, August, and Sep- 
tember, when the passes admit of traveling, 
and for the time being the capital of Ladak 
is quite a busy, noisy town and the rendez- 
vous of natives from all parts — from Lhassa 
and other parts of Thibet, China, Kashgar,

deen), in the Indian Medical Record. 



Yarkand, Kashmir, and India — for the sale 
and purchase of their respective wares, such 
as rich silk, tea, precious stones, skins, dried 
apricots, "c/iurrus" (a kind of intoxicant 
made from hemp), etc. 

The lamas are the spiritual, medical, and 
temporal advisers of the lay people, who vest 
in them the charge of their souls and bodies, 
expecting them to do all that is necessary in 
order to enter Nirvana hereafter — e.g., write 
out prayers for their prayer-wheels, waft 
prayers to heaven on their behalf, etc. The 
onus lies on the people to feed and maintain 
the lama priests, some of whom are thus ex- 
ceedingly well off. 

The method of vaccination used by the 
lamas should more accurately be termed in- 
oculation. Their method of procedure, based 
on the erroneous supposition that one attack 
of smallpox immunizes the patient against a 
second and subsequent attacks, is as follows: 
A quantity of virus is procured from a num- 
ber of ripe smallpox pustules (about eight 
days old), and is made ready for use by 
dilution with water in a small earthenware 
vessel. The instrument used is made of four 
long needles tied firmly together. This is 
dipped into the diluted virus, and then rapidly 
and deeply prodded into the skin and muscle 
between the thumb and forefinger on the 
dorsum of one hand only — usually the left. 
As there are generally some thousands to be 
inoculated, the operation, in many instances, 
is done very imperfectly, and, owing to the 
rapidity with which it is performed, a very 
small quantity of virus enters a very super- 
ficially made wound. This inoculation brings 
out an attack of variola, which is very mild 
(owing to the extreme dilution of the virus) 
and runs a very irregular course. The pa- 
tient is well in a few days, and imagines that 
he is now "proof" against any further at- 
tacks. An epidemic soon' tests this fragile 
protective fabrication in a most searching 
and penetrating manner, and, finding it no 
barrier, no protection against itself, with a 
ready entrance soon lays its subject low. 

During the outbreak of 1892 I was waited 
upon by a deputation of lama priests to give 
them permission to hold a public "vaccina- 
tion" (after their method) in my hospital com- 
pound, whilst I was to stand aside and behold 
the farce, seeing all my teachings in the art 
of vaccination set aside and contemptuously 
ignored. I, of course, resolutely refused 
their request, and in addition had my lama 
friends prohibited by law (through the kind 
help of the British Joint Commissioner to 
Ladak and the Dewan of Lep) from carrying 
on their nefarious practice in public. At the 
same time I announced publicly that I would

( &gt;n application to the K

:he lymph being utterly inert; 
the whole thing seemed like "playing at vac-

ibU with my i results they | 

shook their heads anil condemned the new 
- :m manly. This was, of course, 
only what could be expected under the cir- 
cumstances. I felt defeated, for failure just 
at the threshold of the introduction of a new 
method and system of vaccination in a strange 
country, where superstitious notions prevail 
concernii.. s of all things most undesir- 

able. 

1, however, communicated these facts to 
the Residency Surgeon, and wrote for a sup- 
ply of fresh lymph. This time I received 
thirty-two tubes, and was again ready for 
vaccination. But! — would any one venture 
after such a miserable exhibition of failure' 
Would any have faith in me and my vaccina- 
tion to trust themselves to a second experi- 
ment?- These were questions that vexed me 
the whole of the night after reception of my 
second supply of lymph. The next morning 
my hospital assistant, the caretaker of the 
hospital, and many of the Christian com- 
munity, came forward to be vaccinated, as 
also some out-patients at the dispensary. 
The operation was a grand success this time, 
and was praised by all, especially in that no 
general eruption broke out over the body and 
face, as is the case after a lama " vaccination." 

After all the lymph from the tubes was 
utilized, we carried on vaccination from arm 
to arm. Thus the fame of the "new vacci- 
nation " took deep root in Leh itself, and 
rapidly spread among the outlying villages. 
Delegates were sent to us daily, praying us 
to visit their respective villages and perform 
the " new vaccination." These solicitations 
we acceded to as far as possible, and as soon 
as leisure was had at headquarters I set out 
itinerating, first among the neighboring vil- 
lages, and afterwards among further outlyin 
ones, until in all upwards of 2,000 cases o 
successful vaccination were recorded. 

During the epidemic I had a house placed 
at my disposal for a hospital, but many small- 
pox patients preferred living in tents put up 
in rude Ladaki fashion. With every precau- 
tion used, it was very difficult to segregate 
the patients. It was painful to see case after

of the epidemic of 1892, which began in Au-

Am.ni Baking Powders. — A baking pow- 
der made of cream of tartar and bicarbonate 
of sodium leaves only Rochelle salts in the 
bread; one composed of tartaric acid and bi- 
carbonate of sodium leaves only tartrate of 
sodium. Another compound, of acid phos- 
phate of calcium and bicarbonate of sodium, 
will leave in the bread reverted phosphate of 
calcium and phosphate of sodium; and still 
another, manufactured from alum (dried am- 
monia alum is the kind ordinarily used) and 
bicarbonate of sodium, will leave hydrate of 
aluminium, sulphate of sodium, and sulphate 
of ammonium. If sesquicarbonate or bicar- 
bonate of ammonium is used as a baking 
powder, which is sometimes done by bakers 
in making their finest cakes, the only residue 
left in the bread will be possible traces of 
ammonia, as the carbonates of ammonium 
are completely volatile in the heat of an ordi- 
nary cooking-stove. 

There have been many conflicting state- 
ments made by the manufacturers of various 
baking powders. To believe them all would 
be to give up baking powders altogether, as 
most of them make the most astounding 
statements in regard to the goods of their 
competitors. 

In judging the merit of the different 
baking-powder claims, there are some im- 
portant facts which bear heavily upon the 
subject and may influence a manufacturer's 
mind very decidedly in some cases. I* the 
first place, cream of tartar is a harmless salt,

which separates from grape- juice when the 
atter is made into wine. Tartaric acid is 
nade from cream of tartar, and is the acid 
)f grapes. The residue left by either of 
;hem in the bread by their action on the bi- 
carbonate of sodium, being mildly aperient, 
s inclined to correct indigestion. A powder 
nade with either is considered an excellent 
i&gt;ne, but cream of tartar and tartaric acid are 
expensive substances. Acid phosphate of 
calcium is cheaper than cream of tartar or 
tartaric acid, but leaves reverted phosphate 
)f calcium, as well as the gently purgative 
ohosphate of sodium, in the bread. Alum 
baking powders are usually made with thor- 
oughly dried ammonia alum; on using such 
ji powder the bicarbonate of sodium decom- 
poses the alum into hydrate of aluminium, 
Sulphate of sodium, and sulphate of am- 
uonium. Dried alum is cheap when com- 
pared with cream of tartar or tartaric acid, 
bosting about one-fifth as much — it is also 
cnown as "burnt alum," and is used on ac- 
count of its cheapness. The carbonates of 
immonium are not used to any great extent 
n baking powders; they have been used in 
:&gt;ne or two instances in small quantity to in- 
crease the leavening power, but, having found 
lone in recent analyses, their use has proba- 
oly been dropped, in anticipation of a preju- 
dice that might be stirred against the use 
)f any form of ammonia by the unreasonable 
ittacks of interested manufacturers seeking 
:o push their own .less efficient combinations. 
Dried alum, when not decomposed by bi- 
carbonate of sodium, is poisonous, no doubt; 
i fatal case being on record where death was 
produced by one ounce of it being taken by 
mistake for Epsom salts. — Food and Sanita- 



; Scientific Anaesthesia. — The view is 
&gt;lowly but surely gaining ground that death 
inder chloroform is to a great extent a pre- 
ventable accident; indeed, no other conclusion 
can logically be drawn from the frequency 
Df fatal effects in patients who are for the 
:ime being under the empire of a lethal drug 
idministered in a haphazard, hope-for-the- 
&gt;est fashion — in a manner, forsooth, which 
would never be tolerated on the part of a 
iispensing chemist engaged in manipulating 
-in admittedly dangerous substance. We do 
lot hand a patient a toxic dose of strychnine, 
loping to be able to prevent him swallowing 
nore than is good for him after he has put 
:he draught to his mouth, nor ought we to 
•un the risk of allowing a patient to inhale 
i vapor of unknown and undeterminable 
itrength. It is obvious that by the ordinary 



rough-and-ready method of administering 
chloroform the anaesthetist can only form at 
best an approximate idea of the dilution of 
the vapor or of the absolute amount that is 
entering the patient's lungs, and he is con- 
strained to regulate the administration by the 
observed effects — that is to say, when it is 
possibly too late to avert the effects of an 
overdose already circulating in the blood. 
Long experience and close observation may 
enable trained anaesthetists to follow this plan 
with comparative safety, but even this meas- 
ure of safety cannot be obtained by the prac- 
titioner who is called upon to administer 
chloroform too seldom for his personal ex- 
perience to enable him to define the danger 
limit. The matter would long since have 
been placed on a more scientific basis were 
not coroners' juries handicapped by the fact 
that they are unable to discuss the expert 
evidence brought before them, the more so as 
in every respect but that of measuring the 
amount administered every precaution has 
usually been taken. Reforms are notoriously 
slow to come from within, but this is really a 
matter which calls for some action on the 
part of duly recognized medical authorities. 
If an authoritative opinion in this direction 
were forthcoming from persons whose posi- 
tion would command respect, a useful impulse 
would be given to the adoption of a more 
rational method of administering anaesthetics, 
especially chloroform. We fear that it is idle 
to look to professed anaesthetists to lead the 
way. Each is wedded to the method which, 
thanks to long training, has stood him in 
good stead, and does not hesitate to proclaim 
the maxim " anaesthetics for the anaesthetists," 
which, however true in substance, is for the 
most part quite impracticable. It is not that 
there is any lack of apparatus which permit 
of the administrator controlling the amount 
of chloroform passing into the lungs. The 
reluctance to make use of such apparatus is 
simply the outcome of an indisposition to 
take the trouble to become acquainted with 
the slight amount of practice required for 
their proper employment. — Medical Press and 
Circular. 



Anaesthesia in Veterinary Medicine. — 
The employment of anaesthetics has made 
slow progress in veterinary practice; expense, 
trouble and time being usually the pleas 
offered for their non-adoption. A number 
of veterinary surgeons, however, resort to 
them on every possible occasion, and, putting 
the avoidance of pain on one side, testify to 
the advantages they derive from them; in- 
deed, there are some operations that cannot

found to I advantageous in effecting 

all animals the horse is the one to which 

chloroform can be most safely administered; 

in fact, it is sometimes an arduous task to 
destroy this creature by inhalation of the 
drug. It has been given to hundreds — it 
might be said thousands — of horses, almost 
undiluted with air. and with absolute impu- 
nity. But some veterinary surgeons imagine 
that there may be danger in this rapid anaes- 
thesia, and advise the mixture of chloroform 
and air, which, if it requires a longer time to 
produce the necessary degree of narcosis, is 
safer. 

However this may be, it is gratifying to 
find that attention is being increasingly di- 
rected to this matter; and among those who 
have distinguished themselves in this direc- 
tion, and have labored to dispel the preju- 
dice which still opposes the use of chloroform, 
must be named Mr. Wallis Hoare, F.R.C.V. 
S.. Cork, who, in advising the dilution of 
chloroform vapor with air during inhalation, 
has improved on the ordinary apparatus by 
a modified bag and foot-bellows, which ap- 
pears to be easily worked and effective. 1 or 
adult horses the quantity of chloroform re- 
quired in this apparatus is from one and a 
half to two ounces, the time occupied in pro- 
ducing complete anaesthesia varying from 
ten to fifteen minutes, and Mr. Hoare regards 
loss of muscular power in the limbs and loss 
of sensation on striking the animal firmly on 
the quarter as the best indications of the 
proper stage at which operations may be 
commenced. Mr. Hoare is evidently an en- 
thusiast in this humane practice of veterinary 
surgery, and it is earnestly to be hoped that 
his example may be largely followed; for 
though all animals should receive merciful 
consideration when they have to undergo 
operations, surely none of them is more en- 
titled to this than the horse, whose muteness 
under the infliction of pain seems to lead 
people to think that he suffers but little — a 
grave error, but one which has caused him to 
be more abused and tortured than all the 
others put together. — The Lancet (London). 



Unjustifiable Surgery.— Some time ago 
a professor in a medical college related the 
following: A surgeon lecturing in said col- 
lege visited his office to request his influence 
in inducing a colored man (an old family 



servant) I 

surg .. -at ion performed The first 

mentioned pi replied that the open 

turn was unjustifiable, in his opinion, for th 

n that the gTOWth was a maligna' 

ir advanced as to render any operatil 

interference useless. Said the surgeon in re 

spouse: "Why, of course, the operation woul 
do no good, but the case would make 
splendid clinic." 

Whether the si - told in truth o 
jest, it points a moral. It cannot he denie&lt; 
that many operations are performed upoi 
patients who are compelled to go into chal 
table institutions, that were best let alone 
Within a very short time there were per 
formed, in the operating-room of one of th 
largest hospitals in the East, three surgica 
operations during one afternoon, each on 
predicated upon a false diagnosis, and each on 
plainly unjustifiable. But this unwarranted 
surgery is not confined to public hospital! 
and charitable institutions. One has only t&lt; 
attend a few meetings of medical societies 
wherever held, to be convinced that man 
cases occur in private practice or privat 
hospitals that would have been better if lef 
alone, as will appear upon close criticism 
the reports made 

A lady recently seen, fresh from a surgeon' 
hands, was minus her womb, ovaries, tubes* 
and two inches of her rectum. It is fair 
say that the gentleman who did the ope 
tion was a homoeopathic surgeon, and t 
diagnosis in the case was a displaced uter 
accompanied with reflexes. This being 
myopathic surgery, what organs would hav 
been left had she engaged a regular surgeo: 
to operate, who would cut in proportion? 

To our shame it is said that we are give 
to fads even in surgery, and that these soo 
die, as do the patients. "Be sure you ar 
right, then go ahead," is the wise maxim 
the honest surgeon, and in his hands neithe 
the poor nor the rich will suffer. A surge 
should be a man of firm convictions, 'tis tru&lt; 
but these convictions should be tempere 
with a good knowledge of what he is doing 
and with a feeling of pity for the afflicted.

BILIOUS REHITTENT FEVER OF THE 
TROPICS. 

*Y DOCTOR JOAO VINCENTE TORRES HOMEM.* 

Although the severe bilious fever of the 
ropics sometimes presents the intermittent 
ype, especially at its commencement, still 
he remittent is without any doubt the form 
nost commonly observed in Brazil, as in 
)ther countries; I have therefore selected the 
lenomination which forms the title of this 
)aper. The same pyrexia is also known 
inder the names of: Great Endemic Fever of 
Tropical Climates; Hcematuric Bilious Fever ; 
Nephrorrhagic Bilious Fever; Ictero-Hcemor- 
'hagic Fever; Icteric Pernicious Fever; and 
Yellow Fever of the Acclimated (in Guade- 
oupe). 

No one has better than Doctor Dutrouleau 
termed the pyretological species of which I 
:reat, and distinguished it from all the mor- 
bid conditions with which it may be con- 
bunded. This definition, which I adopt 
:hroughout, is thus couched: 

By bilious fever of the tropics is to be un- 
derstood a pyrexia which, without regard to 
ype, and able to assume all types, presents 
is its essential and oftentimes unique char- 
acteristic the marked and persistent symp- 
:oms of the bilious condition: jaundice, 
/omiting, the stools and urine characterizing 
his condition, and, as grave characteristics, 
;he cerebral, hsemorrhagic, and other phe- 
lomena attributable to change of the blood 
3y bile. 

In this definition the practical physician 
inds the differences separating the bilious 
'ever of the tropics from intermittent or re- 
nittent fever attended by some transitory 



bilious symptoms; from hepatitis followed 
by fever and jaundice; from jaundice de- 
pendent on catarrh of the bile ducts and 
complicated by irregular intermittent par- 
oxysms; and from the grave febrile jaundice 
also known by the name of acute atrophy of 
the liver. 

Bilious remittent fever is a frequent dis- 
ease in the tropics, chiefly during the sum- 
mer; it attacks by preference persons dwelling 
in the city who expose themselves to the heat 
of the sun and commit abuses of diet and 
stimulation; is rarely preceded by simple in- 
termittent fever; and almost never super- 
venes in the course of malarial cachexia. 
Out of forty-three cases which I have care- 
fully observed, only once did the disease 
appear in a cachectic person; all the others 
were attacked when in the enjoyment of per- 
fect health; in the exceptional instance the 
bilious fever seized upon its victim twenty- 
four hours after arrival in the city. In the 
great endemic malarial centres, which are 
now met with only outside the city, and more 
particularly outside the municipio neutro* 
tropical bilious-remittent fever is very rare. 
A distinguished colleague and great observer 
who had an extensive practice in the town of 
Itaguahy during twenty-two years, met with 
only five cases of this pyrexia, while 75 per 
cent, of the patients he had seen suffered 
from other diseases due to the malarial 
miasm. Out of thirty-seven patients ob- 
served in the hospital wards whose clinical 
records are preserved in the archives of the 
University and were thence extracted by me, 
only two came directly to the hospital from 
a notoriously marshy locality — one from 
Belem (Para.) and the other from Villa Xova, 
— and neither suffered from cachexia. I do not 
mean to infer from this that the pyretological

infection; on the contrary, I believe tl 

the tropics is due to the com- 
bined influei the 
from the 

d upon the hepatic functions by the 
. which impresses upon tin 

ial stamp; and the malarial, denoted by 
&gt;n of the spleen, and by 
unavoidable necessity the physician is 
under to resort to large doses of quinine in 
his patients. Still more, the 
influence of malaria becomes patent in many 
regular paroxysms of intermit- 
tent fever appear at the end of the bilious 
fever, when the patient is already rid of the 
principal disease and is about to become 
convalescent, just as happens with other 
manifestations of malarial poisoning. 

The bilious fever of the tropics frequently 
begins with an intense chill, followed by great 
febrile reaction which coincides with symp- 
toms of indigestion; the patient vomits what- 
ever food may be contained in the stomach, 
and a few hours later is attacked by profuse 
diarrhoea In other cases no symptom of 
digestive disturbance is observed during the 
first twenty-four or forty-eight hours; after 
the initial chill, heat appears as in a paroxysm 
of simple intermittent; the fever assumes the 
more or less frankly remittent type, and only 
later on are manifested the special symptoms 
of the bilious condition. 

The febrile heat of the disease is charac- 
terized in the beginning by the rapid rise of 
temperature, which goes up to 106 and even 

- at the end of the first twenty-four hours. 
In the milder cases the remission, which 
ordinarily occurs in the morning, causes the 
thermometer to fall a degree or more (Cei 
grade); in grave cases the oscillations of 
perature do not go beyond five to eight 
tenths of a degree. It is not rare to observe 
at the hour of febrile exacerbation the appear- 
ance of shivering, preceded or not by so 
sweat, manifest on the forehead or neck and 
ling with the period of remission. —

In females, in children, and in males 
marked excitable and ncr . 
ment, delirium occurs on the second or thii 
day — generally mild and consisting of 

tinected words which the patient stajj 
mers spontaneously or when questioned; tl 
delirium heroines more perceptible towar&lt; 
night, when the fever reaches its maximur 
intensity. The tongue is from the con 
mencement covered with a thick coat 
yellow fur, and tends to become dry. Thei 
is very intense thirst, complete anore^ 
nausea, and commonly vomiting. 

After the expulsion of the food containe 
in the stomach, that organ throws off a larg 
amount of bile whenever the patient vomit 
— sometimes of a yellow color, sometim&lt; 
greenish, and in the majority of cases dark- 
which is also mingled with the ingested fluid 
and the gastric mucus. When in the bi 
present in the stomach there is a large qua 
tity of dark pigment (cholepyrrhin), and 
is cast out mixed with the water which tl 
patient drinks in great amount, the vomite 
matter, after standing for some time in* 
large-sized vessel, resembles that of yello 
fever. Constipation, which is customari 
observed in the first forty-eight hours,

legree in bilious fever than in the other 
nalarial pyrexias. The urine, scanty and 
dgh-colored, especially at the beginning of 
he disease, appears later on overloaded with 
►ile-pigments, becomes thoroughly bilious, 
nd still farther on (after the first week) con- 
ains a large amount of albumen. In the 
espiratory system no abnormal sign on aus- 
ultation and percussion is ordinarily found 
q the first few days; the patient neverthe- 
ess has dyspnoea, which goes on progres- 
ively increasing in proportion as the disease 
uns through its natural course. 

It is thus that a severe bilious remittent 
aver behaves in Rio de Janeiro in the first 
gw days. The disease goes on, and whether 
(: ends in death or by recovery the exciting 
ymptoms acquire fresh intensity, some of 
aem experience a great change in their 
ature, and symptoms of another order ap- 
ear, investing the pyrexia with the most 
E xtreme gravity. The jaundice, which was 
artial and but little prominent, becomes 
ery marked and invades the entire skm; 
dynamia appears; the patient's countenance 
.xpresses great prostration of strength; the 
ibdelirium is more continuous, and from 
me to time is interrupted by stupor; sub- 
(jltus tendinum, carphologia and crucidis- 
.ius are noted; the pulse loses force and is 
lore frequent (125 to 130); the febrile heat 
;ffers no perceptible modifications — the 
iiorning remissions are less appreciable; the 
ongue becomes tremulous and dry, the fur 
pvering it blackish; the bilious vomiting con- 
nues with the same frequency or becomes 
irer; diarrhoea almost always increases, and 
ids greatly to increase the adynamia; the 
rine acquires a dark deep color like that of 
offee; the belly is tympanitic; the liver, and 
le spleen as well, still more enlarged. 

At this advanced stage of the disease, ordi- 
arily at the end of the first week, sometimes 
iidway in the second, some passive haemor- 
lages occur, by reason of the cholaemia 
hich attains its maximum development, 
"he greater frequency of haematuria ob- 
lirved in these cases is the origin of two 
enominations by which the disease is known 
1 some countries, viz.: Hczmaturic Bilious 
'ever, and Nephrorrhagic Bilious Fever. 
: Epistaxis, which is not rare as an active 
•Hemorrhage in the first forty-eight hours, man- 



ifests itself in many cases when poisoning of 
the blood by bile takes place. Gastrorrhagia, 
though very rare, has been observed in two 
patients in the Mizericordia Hospital; this 
symptom occurred in a very evident manner 
(Cases 2 and 3), and in one of these patients 
I also observed enterorrhagia. Haematuria, 
metrorrhagia, epistaxis, gastrorrhagia and 
enterorrhagia are the only haemorrhages I 
have observed in the grave bilious remittent 
fever of Rio de Janeiro, and I mention them 
in the same order of frequency with which I 
have met them. In a lady residing in the 
Rua da Imperatriz (Case 4), metrorrhagia, 
which supervened on the sixth day of the 
disease, was so copious that it hastened her 
death by several hours. 

While it is true that haematuria is the most 
common of haemorrhagic manifestations in 
grave bilious fever, even in Rio de Janeiro, 
it is no less true that with us the flow of 
blood from the kidneys is observed very 
much more rarely than in other countries. 
Doctor Dutrouleau says that bloody urine 
appears even in the first days of the disease 
in Senegal; that in the Antilles especially, 
almost all the patients lose a great amount 
of blood by the urine, as soon as jaundice 
becomes very intense and general. But of 
the forty-three cases I have observed, only 
in five was haematuria present — in two hos- 
pital patients the dark color of the urine led 
me to believe that it contained blood, but 
chemical and microscopical analysis demon- 
strated that I was deceived by the enormous 
amount of cholepyrrhin which this fluid 
contained, and which dyed it black. Among 
the five cases of haematuria figures the pa- 
tient who expired immediately after a pro- 
fuse uterine haemorrhage; in the remaining 
four cases the nephrorrhagia was not accom- 
panied by other haemorrhagic flux. 

The haemorrhages in grave bilious fever 
ordinarily coincide with the appearance of 
very exaggerated ataxo-adynamic symptoms; 
this pathological dualism is caused by the 
poisoning of the blood by the principles of 
the bile. The effect produced upon the 
medulla by this profoundly charged blood 
explains the dyspnoea in some patients and 
the epileptiform convulsions met with in 
others (Cases 5 and 6). 

The disease pursues its course, and gradu-

blood; the gums also occasionally give forth 
blood, and the teeth are coated with sordes. 
In consequence of this condition of the 
mouth, the patient's breath is foetid and 
repulsive. 

Vomiting, though more rare in this last 
stage, occurs from time to time, especially 
when the stomach receives a large amount of 
fluid or any medicine locally irritant; the 
diarrhoea continues and becomes much more 
profuse and frequent, and it is not rare to 
observe enterorrhagia — in which case the 
blood is either greatly altered by mixture 
with bile, or the stools are entirely bloody.

Death ordinarily supervenes at the end 0!

time that it entirely leaves him. I have also 
observed during convalescence, in some cases, 
the appearance of muscular and articular 
pains of rheumatic character, that are more 
often referred to the upper and lower limbs. 

Of the thirty-seven cases of grave bilious 
fever observed in the hospital wards in the 
period of ten years, thirteen terminated 
fatally, and twenty-four recovered. Autopsy, 
performed in nine cases, revealed the follow- 
ing lesions: 

Very deep yellow color of integument of 
corpse in all. Complete rigor mortis in five; 
relaxation of limbs in four. Numerous and 
extensive ecchymottc spots in one; very con- 
.fluent petechial spots in one; blood-stains on 
outer surface of upper lip in one. Venous 
•injection of meninges and encephalon in 
■seven; large yellowish serous effusion in 
lateral ventricles of brain in one; yellow 
Color of organs contained in cranial cavity in 
all. Hypostatic congestion of base of both 
lungs in five — in one of these there was 
miliary tuberculosis of the upper lobe of the 
right lung. Effusion of some yellow fluid 
,in cavity of pericardium in three cases; 
■softening of heart tissue in two; excentric 
ihypertrophy of left ventricle in one; fatty 
.degeneration of ventricular walls in two. 
Accumulation of dark bilious fluid in cavity 
[of stomach in four; of bloody fluid in one; 
iStomach entirely empty in two; hyperemia 
[of gastric mucous membrane in seven, very 
[pronounced softening of this membrane in 
tone; hyperemia of mucous membrane of 
[duodenum in three, of jejunum and ileum in 
lone, of transverse colon in two. Liver en- 
llarged in all; enormously congested in five; 
[.yellow throughout its parenchyma in two. 
[Gall-bladder filled with thickened and black 
bile in six; entirely empty in one; containing 
;a little fluid in two. Spleen very large and 
[softened in two; a little enlarged and softened 
in five; of normal size and consistency in 
two. Kidneys congested and enlarged in 
four; slightly hypersemic in two; apparently 
normal in three. Bladder containing urine 
in all, in some more, in others less; urine 
bloody in two, albuminous in three, loaded 
with coloring matter of bile in seven. I met 
in no case with the hemorrhagic foci of the 
kidneys of which some pyretologists speak, 
not even in those two cases where the fluid 



in the bladder evidently contained blood, 
there having been hematuria during life. 

It results from the autopsies in question 
that the stomach and liver are the two organs 
most frequently and most severely compro- 
mised; hence certain of the older physicians 
(StoH, Pinel, Bouilland) were quite right in 
considering this disease as a gastro-hepatitis 
complicated with jaundice. If they had 
recognized and admitted the influence of the 
malarial miasma in the development of this 
morbid entity, the conditions peculiar to hot 
climates concurring powerfully as predis- 
posing causes to this end, they would have 
stated the entire truth. 

There are barely two diseases which can 
be confounded with the grave bilious fever 
of the tropics, viz.: Yellow fever, and paren- 
chymatous hepatitis, the latter also denomi- 
nated acute atrophy of the liver, grave jaundice, 
and htzmorrhaglc jaundice. The first is very 
frequent with us, has appeared at various 
times in the epidemic form, and has latterly 
become endemic; the second is very rare, 
and pertains more especially to the nosology 
of cold climates. 

In my paper upon Yellow Fever (Medical 
Age, 1894, pp. 609 et sea.) will be found 
stated the differences separating the two 
pyrexias, hence I shall here treat solely of 
the marks distinguishing parenchymatous 
hepatitis from bilious fever. 

The former of these affections is not due 
to malarial poisoning, is much more frequent 
in woman than in man, is commonly observed 
during pregnancy, and ordinarily provoked 
by venereal excesses, by abuse of alcoholic 
drinks, by bad hygienic conditions inherent 
to a life of debauchery and poverty, by de- 
pressing passions, and by the previous occur- 
rence of typhoid or typhus fever; in some 
cases it appears secondarily in the course of 
pneumonia, acute miliary tuberculosis, typhus, 
or other grave disease. A genuine parenchy- 
matous- inflammation (in the strict accepta- 
tion of the word, acute atrophy of the liver) 
is characterized in the anatomico-pathologi- 
cal point of view by an exudate occupying 
the interior of the hepatic cells, which, dis- 
tended and strangulated by it, lose their 
proper functional and vital activity. In al- 
most all cases there is, as a concomitant, an 
interstitial exudate, which occupies the

fallible consequence of the atrophy of tin-

of the hepatic function in n

thc entire peril of the d 
IS for the contrast noted between the 
symptoms of the first and those of the second 
of the morbid process. As long as 
only the initial lesion exists, before the 
atrophy takes place, the patient's condition 
shows no apparent gravity— nothing denotes 
imminent danger; but the atrophic stage 
manifests itself, and at once appear with 
great intensity the toxaemic and nervous 
turns (ataxia and hemorrhages). 

hepatitis and gastro-duodenal ca- 
tarrh are ordinarily revealed during the first 
few days of the symptoms proper, and in this 
period nothing in the condition of the patient 
indicates gravity. The fever, which appears 
without preceding chill, is always moderate; 
the thermometer never rises above 101.5 - 
; the progress of the pyrexia is not in 
accordance with the frank remittent type; 
and there are cases in which the morbid pro- 
cess runs through all its stages without genu- 
ine fever occurring. 

Twelve or fifteen days after the beginning 
of the disease appears a jaundice of little in- 
tensity, that remains mild for the space of 
many days, and becomes very marked and 
grave only after the work of atrophy of the 
liver has commenced, when acholia occurs. 

In cases where there is a temperature of 
104 or more, this exaggerated heat coincides 
with the appearance of ataxic and haemor- 
rhagic symptoms, and is connected with the 
tice of bile-poisoning of the blood. 
Even when this high temperature occurs, 
well marked morning remissions are not ob- 
served, the thermometer barely falling three 
or four tenths of a degree (continued type). 
In the toxemic stage of the disease there is 
almost always delirium, coma, and convul- 
sions; palpation and percussion demonstrate 
that the hepatic gland is reduced in size and 
the spleen very much enlarged; the bowels 
are obstinately constipated, and evacuations

m the distinguishing 

which I have just referred, it is impossible foi 
an experienced physician to confound bilious 
remittent fever of the tropics with atrophic 
nchymatous hepatitis. The gy,* 

pathogenic conditions, symptomatology, prog- I 
ress of morbid phenomena, and results ob- 
tained with quinine, in the one anil in th&lt; 
other of these two affections, will suffice to 
clear up the diagn&lt; 

Bilious fever of the tropics, whatever the 
type it assumes, is a grave disease. This, 
gravity, admitted by all pyretologists, and 
recognized by myself in Rio de Janeiro, is 
due to combination of the aetiological ele- 
ments. The malarial element exercises | 
upon the climatic element an aggravating 
effect, and thus combined they give rise to 
the complex pyrexia in question; simple bil- 
ious fever, non-malarial, in whatever climate | 
it develops, is always a benign complaint. 
The remittent type of the fever, moreover, 
constitutes an unfavorable element in prog- 
nosis, and the continued type is still more 
unfavorable. The frank intermittent type, 
the rarest of all, is that which renders the 
disease less grave. The early appearance of 
the ataxic symptoms and haemorrhages, the 
previous existence of malarial cachexia or of 
any other manifestation of malarial infection, 
and the lack of specific medication during 
the first few days of the malady, are circum- 
stances that greatly aggravate the prognosis. 

The fundamental indications in treatment 
are: To combat the bilious symptoms of the 
first stage, facilitating by all methods the 
prompt excretion of bile and preventing its 
accumulating in the hepato-biliary organs: 
To combat the basis of the disease, by op- 
posing an antidote to the miasmatic poison- 
ing which determines the functional and 
anatomical derangements in these organs] 
To neutralize the effects of the toxaemia due 
to the elements of bile, and to purify the 
blood of these noxious elements and restore 
its normal crasis. 

To attain the first desideratum, the physi- 
cian should have recourse to local blood- 
letting if there is noteworthy congestion of 
the liver; to emetics, especially ipecac, and

calomel in purgative doses; to the neutral 
salts, especially sulphate of magnesia or sul- 
phate of soda; and to diuretic ptisans of 
which nitrate of potash, acetate of potash, or 
soluble cream of tartar forms a part. 

To fulfill the second indication, there is no 
other efficient means than the muriate or 
valerianate of quinine, so administered that 
it shall be promptly and easily absorbed, 
modifying its local action upon the stomach 
by the correctives well known in thera- 
peutics. 

To fulfill the third indication, resort must 
be had to tonics and diffusible stimulants — 
against adynamia; to antispasmodics and the 
cutaneous revulsives — against ataxia; to the 
astringents, particularly the perchloride of 
iron — against haemorrhages; to the vege- 
table acids, especially citric acid — against 
the diffluence of the fibrin dependent on 
cholaemia. 

Such are the means I have employed in 
grave bilious fever, varying them, diluting 
them, combining them in different ways, ac- 
cording to the special circumstances of each 
patient. In almost all the cases observed in 
the hospital wards, I used wet cups in the 
hepatic region; in two I applied leeches to 
the verge of the anus, because the congestion 
of the liver was enormous, the patients felt 
great pain in the right hypochondrium, and 
both had a temperature over 104 . 

I never resorted to general bleeding, and 
think this should be reserved for certain very 
exceptional cases in which in the first days 
of the disease great hyperemia of the men- 
inges and brain coincides with high fever. 
In using local blood-letting, especially by 
means of leeches, the practitioner ought not 
to lose sight of the toxaemia which will mani- 
fest itself by ataxo-adynamic symptoms and 
at times by haemorrhages as well. Six or 
eight wet cups to the hepatic region, and 
possibly in some cases the same number of 
leeches to the verge of the anus, is the pro- 
cedure when I deem it necessary to unload 
the liver by taking blood; I rarely exceed 
this limit. 

If the tongue is very much furred, if there 
is nausea or even vomiting from the begin- 
ning — as is the rule, — I make use of ipecac- 
uanha — two hundred grammes of the infusion 
holding in suspension two grammes of 



powder. After obtaining emetic action, I 
give one gramme of calomel in three doses — 
one every two hours. And it is only after 
the patient has vomited and purged freely 
that I begin to give quinine, combining it 
with extract or tincture of rhubarb, accord- 
ing to the formula preferred. At the same 
time I put the patient on a diuretic drink, 
into which enter two grammes of nitre and 
eight grammes of soluble cream of tartar. 
When the stomach does not tolerate quinine, 
as frequently happens, I administer this drug 
by enema (Cases 2 and 3). 

This treatment is continued during the first 
stage of the disease — that is, so long as only 
the bilious symptoms, accompanied by frank 
febrile reaction, are present. As soon as 
ataxic phenomena appear, if these phenomena 
are dependent upon cholaemia, I make use of 
stimulant and antispasmodic mixtures, and 
give the patient acid lemonades in large 
amount. Cinchona, musk, ether, valerian, car- 
bonate or muriate of ammonia, and canella, 
are the means I prefer, sometimes one, some- 
times another, according to the effect ob- 
tained, and almost always attenuating them 
with a few spoonfuls of good wine. Orange- 
ade, lemonade of lemon, of lime, of caja* or 
of tamarinds, strongly acidulated and at times 
iced, are the acid drinks to which I give 
preference, according to the resources avail- 
able and the patient's choice. 

If haemorrhages appear and are profuse, I 
have recourse to astringents, chiefly gallic 
acid or perchloride of iron; but if the loss of 
blood is of little account, as is the general 
rule, I use no direct medication against it, 
but press the iced lemonades, and apply com- 
presses of ice-water to the region corre- 
sponding to the organ which is furnishing the 
blood. 

If the patient, after getting out of danger, 
or during convalescence, has paroxysms of 
intermittent type, I again give quinine, in 
combination with Agua de Quinia. 

I must now impress upon the physician the 
necessity he is under of resorting to quinine 
at the earliest possible moment, and of giving 
this drug in large doses, proceeding just as 
he would proceed if he had to subdue a

violent pernicious attack. If the opportunity 
es — if the quantity of the remedy is in- 
sufficient to combat the miasmatic poisoning 
— the patient's condition will be 

more grave later on; his symptoms will be 
under the pernicious Influence of two poison- 
ings—the cholaemic, which supervenes in con- 
sequence of the entrance into the blood of 
the active principles o( the bile; and the 
malarial, which still persists, inasmuch 
has not been neutralized and therefore con- 
tinues to produce the same disturbance in 
the hepato-biliary apparatus, the starting- 
point of the choloemia. To combat the 
cholaemic poisoning, therapeutics furnishes 
many resources of which the physician may 
avail himself without prejudice to the pa- 
dent; these resources have been already 
mentioned — purgatives, diuretics, acid lemon- 
ades. To combat the malarial poisoning, 
the only sure means is quinine, and this is 
contra-indicated after the ataxo-adynamic 
symptoms of cholaemia manifest themselves, 
because it renders them more grave and more 
pronounced. It is, then, important to lose 
no time nor make timorous experiments 
when it is a question of using the salts of 
quinine in the bilious fever of the tropics. 
So long as cholaemia has not developed, so 
long as only bilious symptoms and fever 
exist, the practitioner should give quinine in 
the dose of twelve decigrammes or two 
grammes per day, during two consecutive 
days; afterwards he will gradually lessen the 
dose until he reaches forty-five centigrammes. 
Under this procedure, either the cholaemic 
poisoning will be slight — inasmuch as the 
primary cause producing it had not time to 
act for many days, and was at once entirely 
neutralized, — or in case it supervenes with 
full severity, the system will strive with it 
alone; in proportion as the blood goes on 
ridding itself of the noxious principles which 
altered its crasis, and continues to approxi- 
mate the normal condition, fresh toxic ele- 
ments of the same sort as those eliminated 
will not be carried into the current of circula- 
tion by the veins and lymphatics of the liver, 
since the course of the bile has been now re- 
established, and the cause that embarrassed 
this course has been removed.

There arc- many who, essaying to be authori- 
ties on major surgical diseases, have n&lt; 
ception whatever of injuries of the perineum 
and cervix, so far as their intelligent re; 
concerned; indeed, there are many enjoying 
large obstetrical practice who labor under the 
delusion that they have never ruptured a 
perineum, and that all their patients have 
entirely normal perinea — a misconception due 
to improper teaching, more than to any other 
cause. When it is considered that many of 
the prominent teachers do not hesitate to 
maintain that with this or that manipulation 
a perineum need never be ruptured — leaving 
out of sight altogether the fact that no pro- 
cedure affords absolute security — there need 
be no surprise that errors of belief are so 
common and pernicious. 

Perineal lacerations, unless they extend 
through the skin, to or through the sphinc- 
ter, may elude detection by any but the most 
thorough digital examination. It is a serious 
error to start with the idea that a perineal 
tear does not exist unless the external part 
to which the name "perineum" is applied is 
lacerated. 

Obstetrical teaching directs that the peri- 
neum be supported with the hand or with a 
towel, so as to prevent a tear; while the truth 
of the matter is that the most injurious tears 
often occur before there is any indication for 
support. It must be remembered that the 
perineum proper is made up of all the muscles 
composing the lower pelvic diaphragm, and 
that this diaphragm is anatomically the ad- 
junct and coefficient of the upper or true 
diaphragm of the respiratory apparatus; this 
fact is of importance in estimating the signifi- 
cance of pelvic lacerations; and the simple 
suggestion will be sufficient to indicate an- 
other and often forgotten phase of the logic 
by which the repair of these lacerations is to 
be insisted upon. As a primary and funda 
mental feature for the due appreciation of 






THE MEDICAL AGE.

every perineal tear, it is to be remembered 
that it begins on the inside, or, in other 
words, proceeds from above downward, from 
within outward; that an important outside 
tear without a coexisting internal tear is an 
accident of extreme rarity; and beside, that 
there maybe most serious internal laceration 
without any dermal manifestations. 

Then again, there may be so much over- 
distention of the tissues that all pelvic sup- 
port is absent, without any evidence of real 
laceration. This sort of tear bears the same 
relation to evident laceration that a subcu- 
taneous tenotomy does to a free open incision 
of a muscle; the more apparent operation is 
not more real than the other. So it is in 
pelvic tears, and overdistention may, just as 
truly as more apparent injuries, deserve the 
categorical term of ''laceration" and claim 
surgical repair. 

"Complete perineal laceration" is a term 
usually applied to tears through the sphinc- 
ter. These tears are regarded as the most 
important, on account of the discomfort 
they entail from a cosmetic point of view. 
Women with the sphincter ani lacerated have 
entailed upon them a miserable existence, 
though other complications and calamities 
of pelvic laceration may be absent. Even 
though the sphincter be torn through, there 
may be no sagging of the pelvic contents, no 
cystocele., no rectocele, no prolapsus uteri. 
This is explainable if we remember that in a 
distinctly central tear the lateral attachments 
of the muscles and fascia are uninjured, 
while the middle junction of the perineal 
muscles is simply split, divided, or separated, 
and consequently the support, while dimin- 
ished, is sufficient to withstand the pressure 
; force of the pelvic contents; in other words, 
the resistance of the muscles is diminished, 
not destroyed. 

Complete tears ought to be considered as 
including all deep fascial and muscle lacera- 
tions, either on one or both sides, with a co- 
existing or non-coexisting sphincter tear as 
the case may be. All of these deserve care- 
ful attention, and should be approached as 
distinct surgical lesions, to be repaired in the 
'line of their anatomical destruction and not 
as cosmetic operations whose object is to 
obtain superficial appearances without regard 
to perfection and utility. Heaping up of 



tissue outside the lines of resistance and ten- 
sion, or mere thickening of mucous mem- 
brane and skin, does not make a true peri- 
neum; neither dees a set of outside sutures, 
however much they may draw the parts 
together, afford any anatomical counterpart 
of a perineum. From this basis all the so- 
called outside flap-splitting operations for 
perineal tears are only puckering operations, 
bringing together parts within the sutures 
that have never been severed, and in many 
cases taking them out of their proper rela- 
tions. The instruments formerly suggested 
as the wherewithal for perineal repair, of 
which the Peaslee or Baker Brown needle 
may be taken as the type, should be relegated 
to sail-makers and cobblers, for they have 
no place in the delicate scientific surgery of 
the parts. Big sutures, heavy ligatures and 
clumsy instruments have here no more place 
than in other surgery. The ordinary short 
strong sewing-needle fills the bill exactly in 
most cases, though Emmet's strong, fine, 
short needle is preferable for general use; 
and silkworm-gut or silver wire is the pref- 
erable suture; these, with a needle-holder 
without cock and shot compressor, and ten- 
aculum, are really the only instruments re- 
quired. It is here as in other operations: 
once understood, they are simplified, and the 
simpler they are the more easy their per- 
formance and the more assured their success 
and utility, so long as their scientific concep- 
tion is correct. 

The Emmet operation as originally sug- 
gested, and afterwards modified by its distin- 
guished devisor, is the foundation for all 
successful operations on the lacerated peri- 
neum, either with or without sphincter tear. 
This, it is to be remembered, is always an in- 
side operation. Even in sphincter tears two 
or three outside stitches are all that in the 
majority of cases are necessary. Its so-called 
modifications are extensions only of the 
original idea of Emmet, and are only original 
in the use of a greater denudation, with a con- 
sequent increase in the number of stitches. 

The ordinary Emmet operation has so fre- 
quently been described and discussed that I 
shall now confine my attention to the method of 
closing complete tears— that is, those through 
the sphincter. In this condition, as in tears 
of lesser extent, the flap-splitting operations

and that any flap-splitting that attempts to

overreaching itself — attempting to repair two 
or more distinct lesions at one time. When 
the fascia is injured, in addition to the sphinc- 
ter tear, the injury is to be remedied by the 
ordinary Emmet operation. This operation 
by its denudation brings into relation large 
triangular bevels on one or both sides, put- 
ting into relation the torn ends of the torn 
les. When the sphincter ani is ruptured, 
it must be remembered that its torn ends are 
drawn outward and backward until they lie 
on a line with the posterior line of the rec- 
tum; in other words, the muscle is straight- 
ened. The depressions on either side of the 
anus are caused by the torn ends of the mus- 
cles retracting the mucous membrane, thus 
forming the characteristic dimples The de-

Failure of this operation is easily disc

more or less complete failure of the operation, 
and the desired effect is not obtained. To 
insure complete success, extreme care is 
necessary to restore the bowel, and to treat 
the sphincter as an integral portion of the 
same, bringing the sutures down so as to 
leave no pocket between the bowel proper 
and that portion into which the sphincter is 
inserted. The ability to operate successfully 
upon the torn sphincter indicates a proficiency 
and delicacy in plastic surgery which every 
surgeon undertaking to repair lacerated peri- 
nea should possess. Ability to perform the 
operation will often save the general practi- 
tioner of obstetrics from unkindly criticism, 
and his patients as well as those of his pro- 
fessional neighbors from much suffering and 
inconvenience. 

The tears of perinea are often unavoidable, 
but their restoration is always possible, and 
their neglect is criminal.

LEUCORRHCEA: ITS CAUSES, VARIETIES, 
AND TREATMENT.*

The subject of the present communis. 
trite as it may seem, is well deserving of 
fuller consideration than is generally accorded 
to it by modern gynaecological authorities In 
a large proportion of instances the first symp- 
tom that directs the attention of patients to

some abnormal mucoid exudation from the 
genital canal. Such discharges, although 
usly symptomatic, are frequently so 
prominent a feature of these cases, or

obscure in their causation, so far-reaching in 
their consequences, or so intractable in their 
management, as to occasion no small part 
of the diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties 
encountered in this special branch of prac- 
tice. 

It may, therefore, be not altogether use- 
less to review briefly, from the standpoint 
of a somewhat extended clinical experience, 
our knowledge of the general pathology of 
leucorrhcea, the circumstances from which it 
originates, the results it occasionally pro- 
duces, and the methods available for its 
treatment. 

Under the term "leucorrhcea" I shall here 
include all those mucoid exudations con- 
taining elements foreign to healthy mucus 
that may proceed from the lining membrane 
of any portion of the female genital tract. 
These discharges are commonly classified in 
accordance with their special cause or from 
their primary location. The latter arrange- 
ment — although open to the objection that 
this complaint seldom remains permanently 
confined to its starting-point, and also that its 
characteristics, consequences and treatment 
are influenced not alone by its situation but 
by special exciting causes and by constitu- 
tional conditions — is nevertheless probably as 
good as any other that can be suggested, and 
hence will be followed in the subsequent ob- 
servations, in the course of which the vulvar, 
vaginal, uterine, and tubal forms of leucor- 
rhcea must be separately discussed. 

I may premise that mere blennorrhea, or 
simple hypersecretion of the mucus — con- 
taining no morphological elements besides 
detached epithelial cells and mucous corpus- 
cles — normally secreted by the genital lining 
membrane, does not come within the purview 
of my remarks on leucorrhcea, although it is 
so included by other writers. Irrespectively 
of any pathological conditions, the natural 
secretion of mucous may physiologically be 
increased by local hyperemia consequent on 
ovulation or pregnancy; moreover, its nor- 
mal amount bears a constant relation to other 
circumstances, being greatest during the 
epochs of reproductive activity and in mar- 
ried life, and least before the period of puberty 
and again in advanced age when the vaginal 
rugae become comparatively bloodless or 
obliterated, and when, also, the uterus and its 



adnexa generally undergo a more or less 
marked process of senile atrophy. 

In reference to leucorrhceal discharges 
from the labia, nymphae, and adjoining parts 
within the vulvar area or in immediate 
vicinity, it may be observed that not only 
are these mucous surfaces peculiarly exposed 
to the external or catarrhal, infective, and 
traumatic causes of local inflammation re- 
sulting in exudations, but also that the con- 
tiguous glandular structures present a fertile 
field for their development and extension. 
For instance, the vulvo-vaginal or Bartho- 
linian glands in the deep fascia on either side 
of the vaginal orifice are, together with their 
afferent ducts opening at the side of the 
nymphae, liable to inflammation, often result- 
ing in abscess or in cystic disease, one of the 
first symptoms of which is an excessive and 
vitiated mucoid exudation. 

The most common causes of vulvar leucor- 
rhcea are, with one exception, especially ex- 
emplified in pediatric practice. Thus, in the 
Children's Hospital, Dublin, with which I 
have been connected for the past twenty- 
three years, I have had occasion, as I pointed 
out in some lectures published in 1886, and 
again in my recent " Handbook of Diseases 
of Women," to notice the great frequency 
and importance of leucorrhcea in children of 
all ages from infancy up to puberty. More- 
over, such discharges may possibly become 
of medico- legal as well as therapeutic inter- 
est, as I have seen in several instances where 
I have been called on to give medical evi- 
dence in reference to charges arising from 
this occurrence. 

As, however, the practical importance of 
vulvar leucorrhcea in childhood does not ap- 
pear to be sufficiently recognized, I would 
commend the following remarks of Keating 
to the careful consideration of those who 
have to deal with such cases: 

The catarrhs of infancy, which may result 
from cold, pent-up secretions, want of clean- 
liness, etc., act on the mucous lining of the 
uterus, as they do on that of the nasal pas- 
sage, producing congestion, infiltration, and 
finally stenosis of the passages. The effect 
this has upon the uterus is to congest it, to 
obstruct its canal, and to increase its weight, 
and undoubtedly not a few of the uterine 
flexions and versions, with their many symp- 
toms, including dysmenorrhcea, that attend

ill the causes of vulvar leucorrhcea, one 
important in childhood is a con- 
stitutional strumous taint, the local influence 
of which is often as obvious in this complaint 
as in the chronic glandular affections of 
children of that diathesis. Next in frequency 
in the causation of such discharges at all 
ages, but more especially in the ill-cared-for 
children of the poor who have come before 
me in the extern departments of the hospitals 
to which I have been attached, is the too 
common neglect of that attention to the 
cleanliness of the genitalia which is essential 
to their sanitary integrity. In other in- 
stances, vulvar leucorrhcea is consequent on 
local irritation traceable to ascarides. Still 
more frequently, in young and old alike, it 
presents a catarrhal form following exposure 
to cold or wet; or it may result from direct 
injury to the parts, as well as from any other 
cause of vulvar inflammation. 

Reserving the "specific" forms of leucor- 
rhcea for subsequent consideration, the ordi- 
nary symptoms of pudendal inflammation 
leading to mucoid discharges from the vulva 
are, briefly: A sense of fullness or discomfort 
in the external genitalia, together with a hy- 
peraemic tumefaction of the vulvar mucous 
membrane, followed by the exudation of a 
discharge which from the first is generally 
much more viscid and tenacious than in the 
vaginal forms of the complaint. In many 
instances the pudendal orifice is so glued

from the abnormal exudations, which, when 
allowed to accumulate there, are liable tol 
me decomposed and thus not only in- 
crease the local irritation but also furnish a 
medium for the reception and development 
of pathogenic micro-organisms by which the 
entire genital tract may be speedily in- 
fected. 

Without entering into detail on so wide a 
question as the causes, immediate or predis- 
posing, of the hyperaemic and other condi- 
tions of the vulva that may give ris 
leucorrhceal discharges therefrom, and the 
recognition and treatment of which are essen- 
tial to their cure, it will, perhaps, suffice to 
say that, in ordinary cases of catarrhal and 
simple inflammatory mucoid discharges from 
the lower segment of the genital tract, these 
exudations may, generally speaking, be ar- 
rested either by the application to the vulvar 
mucous surface, by the insufflator, of non- 
irritating, dry, antiseptic, astringent agents — 
such as boric acid and ferric alum — or by the 
topical employment of borated glycerin, and 
glycerite of carbolic acid; or, and oftentimes 
no less effectually, by some of the older 
fashioned ordinary local astringents, such as 
a strong (#. e. } twenty-five- per-cent.) solution 
of nitrate of silver. In the interval between 
these applications the parts should be kept 
well separated by antiseptic gauze, satu- 
rated with dilute lead water, or distilled 
extract witch hazel, until the discharge has 
completely subsided. During this local treat- 
ment the patient, if we wish to effect a speedy 
and permanent cure of acute vulvar leucor- 
rhcea, should be restricted to bed, and, after 
free purgation, be put on a light, nutritious 
dietary. Even in the chronic forms of this 
complaint these measures are frequently no 
less advisable, in conjunction with the addi- 
tion of any tonic or other remedy that may 
be specially indicated by the existence of the

strumous, chlorotic, anaemic, or other consti- 
tutional cachexia, one or other of which is 
50 generally associated with chronic vulvar 
leucorrhceal discharges, and by which, in not 
a few instances, they may be produced or 
kept up. 

Whilst, as already observed, leucorrhcea, if 
neglected, sooner or later travels far beyond 
its primary seat, nevertheless in many in- 
stances this process of invasion is indefinitely 
protracted, and for a time at least the com- 
plaint remains localized and evinces distinc- 
:ive features consequent on the structural and 
physiological characteristics of its starting- 
point. Thus, for instance, leucorrhceal dis- 
:harges from the mucous membrane of the 
ower portions of the vagina are generally 
less viscid than those proceeding either from 
he vulva or from the upper part of the 
vagina, and especially less so than those 
:rom the cervix. From the latter, vaginal 
nucoid exudations further differ, not only in 
heir acid reaction, but also in that peculiar 
bpalescent yellowish-white, creamy color to 
which the disease owes its popular name — 
'the whites." This distinctive appearance 
s obviously due as much to the larger pro- 
portion of albuminous constituents, both in 
isolution and in suspended flocculi of coagu- 
ated albumen, which such vaginal secre- 
tions contain, as to the presence therein 
i(as was originally demonstrated by the late 
|Tyler Smith, to whose exhaustive and too 
seldom acknowledged researches on this sub- 
ject subsequent writers owe much) of innu- 
merable scaly epithelial cells and fatty debris, 
(with which, as the disease progresses, genu- 
;ne pus-corpuscles and blood-disks may even- 
:ually be interspersed. 

On the other hand, those yet more opaque, 
semi-solid, curdy exudations, frequently ob- 
servable in the upper portion of the vagina, 
generally result from the admixture there of 
its acid secretions with the alkaline cervical 
discharges, and the consequent firm coagula- 
tion and ultimate local adhesion of their albu- 
minous constituents. In this way the vaginal 
walls may become so densely encrusted by 
jpseudo-membranous-looking exudations as to 
Iproduce those appearances which some au- 
thorities have, as I think erroneously, ascribed 
to croupous or diphtheritic vaginal disease. 

The causes of this condition include all 



the forms of local irritation to which the 
genital canal is liable, such as the following: 
Catarrhal and strumous inflammation of the 
vagina; follicular vaginitis; specific, and 
more especially gonorrhceal, infection; neg- 
lect of cleanliness; irritation from worms; 
vaginal tumors; congestion resulting from 
uterine displacements; mechanical injuries; 
over-stimulation of the parts — as frequently 
evinced in newly married patients. Vaginal 
leucorrhcea may also arise from the extension 
of uterine, tubal, ovarian, or pelvic disease; 
from the genital hyperemia attending the 
latter months of pregnancy; from the top- 
ical congestion ushering in the catamenial 
epochs or consequent on the menopause. 
Moreover, independently of any local lesion, 
leucorrhceal discharges may be vicarious of 
menstruation; may be consequent on arrested 
lactation, or due to metastasis of remote dis- 
orders; and lastly, they may be the result of 
constitutional debility, however occasioned, 
giving rise to impaired tonicity of the vaginal 
mucous surface, and consequent hypersecre- 
tion therefrom. 

Although the causes of leucorrhcea are so 
many-sided, as is indicated in the foregoing 
list — which might be extended, — it will suffice 
here to refer chiefly to the more important 
of the inflammatory or sub-inflammatory 
conditions that commonly give rise to that 
discharge. Amongst these are: Catarrhal 
and simple local inflammations; infective or 
gonorrhceal; strumous; and follicular vul- 
vitis. In not a few instances, however, it 
will be found practically impossible to dis- 
tinguish between the three former — all of 
which, if unchecked, may eventuate in the 
last-named or follicular type of the disease. 

Vaginal leucorrhcea, from any of these in- 
flammatory lesions, is generally preceded by a 
sense of heat and irritation in the affected 
mucous surface, which at the same time is 
tumefied and dry, until this hyperemia be- 
comes relieved by more or less profuse leu- 
corrhceal exudations from the inflamed mem- 
brane. On local examination the calibre 
of the canal will now be found diminished 
owing to the congestive tumefaction of its 
walls, and the vaginal mucous membrane 
highly vascular in aspect when freed from 
the tenacious and possibly muco-purulent 
discharge by which it is coated, and by which

ntiation 

:\c inflammatory exudations of the 
vaginal mucous membrane is a . 

importance, and often of much diffi- 
culty. In both instances the extending local 
inflammation may give rise to discharges 
from the mucosa of the urethra and bladder 
as well as from the vulvo-vaginal surface, 
which can only be distinguished by the pres- 
ence or otherwise of the gonococci of Ne 
Frequently, however, this test is not practi- 
cally available, nor is it always reliable, as 
that gonococcus is not invariably discovera- 
ble with certainty, at least by immediate mi- 
croscopic examination, in gonorrhceal dis- 
charges, whilst, as Parrish and Baldy have 
pointed out, occasionally other micro-organ- 
isms, apparently morphologically identical 
with gonococci, are found, which can be dis- 
tinguished only by an expert; moreover, as 
they add, " the disciples of Xeisser have by 
no means satisfactorily proven that the gono- 
coccus is the cause of gonorrhoea." Under 
these circumstances diagnosis must, as a 
rule, be grounded on the probabilities and 
history rather than on the immediate patho- 
logical evidences, or on the symptoms of the 
complaint. It should hardly be necessary, 
therefore, in this connection, to remark that 
in cases such as these, in which a patient's 
reputation or domestic happiness may be 
involved in the question now referred to, 
opinions cannot be too carefully considered 
or too cautiously expressed. 

Vaginal leucorrhoea, whatever its origin, as 
before said, invariably tends to extension to 
the contiguous mucosa; and hence urethritis, 
vulvitis, and cervicitis — often resulting in 
dysmenorrhea and sterility — are daily ob- 
served in cases of this kind. Moreover, the 
specifically infective forms of vaginal exuda- 
tion, if neglected, frequently lead either to 
endo-uterine disease or to graver tubal com-

all that need be locally employed in the initi 
stage is hot water abundantly and frequent

As soon, however, as the acute inflamm 
tory condition of the vaginal mucous mem- 
brane commonly connected with the com- 
mencement of leucorrhcea has subsided, 01 
where it does not exist, and when the 
exudation has become well established, the 
employment of some local and astringe 
application may prove remarkably effectu 
as I found in several instances, in arrest- 
ing vaginal discharges and removing 
chronic inflammatory conditions with which 
they may be connected. In the way of the 
so-called "dry treatment," with the aid of the 
vaginal insufflator I generally employ a poW' 
der consisting of equal parts of boric acid and 
alum, or iron-alum, introduced into the vagina 
daily until the discharge becomes checked. 

In a few otherwise intractable cases of- 
chronic vaginal leucorrhcea, I have found! 
special benefit to accrue from the local use 
of a mixture of one part of glycerite of car- 
bolic acid with four of glycerite of tannin, 
applied by means of a saturated tampon in- 
troduced through the speculum, on the re- 
moval of which the tampon should be retained

or some time so as to bring the contracting 
aginal walls in contact with the expressed 
stringent. In one instance my assistant, by 
ccident, saturated the cotton wool with pure 
arbolic acid, nor was this discovered until 
be vaginal surface was observed to become 

hitened and shriveled up. The vaginal 
urface was then washed out with an alkaline 
ejection, and the patient remained uncon- 
oious of the mistake that had occurred, 
ome days subsequently a complete cast of 
le vaginal mucous membrane was thrown 
ff, the result being a permanent cure of the 
re-existing vaginitis and consequent leucor- 
icea. This method of treatment, I need 
ardly say, is not here mentioned as one to 
e generally adopted in such instances; few, 

any, of which will require any other local 
emedies than those above recommended. 

The physiological hyperemia of the genital 
act consequent on gestation, commonly 
ives rise to hypersecretion of vaginal mucus, 
'his, being a symptom rather than a disease 
f pregnancy, generally calls for nothing 
lore than proper attention to local cleanli- 
ess by the free use of warm water and coal- 
ar or carbolic soap, or possibly the occasional 
mployment of vaginal insufflations with boric 
cid. In some instances, however, the exuda- 
on is of thicker consistence, creamy or yel- 
)wish in color, and distinctly muco-purulent, 
iving rise to intense pruritus of the puden- 
um, especially in the latter months of preg- 
ancy. This discharge may be confounded 
ith that resulting from gonorrhoea! infec- 
on, from which it must be differentiated as 
efore described. Moreover, as Leishman 
bserved, when simply due to pregnancy, 
ven the most profuse discharges rapidly 
isappear after delivery, and seldom attract 
ny notice after the lochia has ceased to 
ow. Cases, however, occasionally occur in 
mich such a discharge, originally appearing 
uring pregnancy, lasts during the convales- 
ence after labor, and ends in an obstinate 
nd troublesome vaginal leucorrhcea. The 
reatment of this affection must necessarily 
e confined within certain limits, so that 
ometimes palliation is the most we can hope 
or. Cauterants or strong injections cannot 
e employed, lest they should induce prema- 
ure labor, and even the simplest injections 
lust, if used, be employed with the greatest 



possible caution, as it is well known that re- 
peated injections, even of tepid water, will 
often suffice to induce uterine contractions. 

In cases of this kind I have myself almost 
always found constitutional treatment, and 
more especially the exhibition of iron and 
quinine or other tonics, no less necessary and 
serviceable than that mere attention to vulvo- 
vaginal cleanliness which, together with as- 
tringent lotions and suppositories, is more 
commonly relied on. 

Leucorrhceal discharges in the last months 
of pregnancy are especially prone to occasion 
great irritation or even erosion of the ex- 
ternal genitalia; and for the relief of such 
cases of pruritus, I recommend a fair trial of 
the ordinary local sedatives. 

Apart from any of the before-mentioned 
direct local sources of local irritation or 
hypersemia, the secretions of the vaginal and 
uterine mucous surfaces may be abnormally 
augmented and altered by various constitu- 
tional causes, as is observed in patients of t 
well marked strumous diathesis, in whom 
abundant glairy exudations from the genital 
mucosa are hardly less common than the 
similar looking catarrhal discharges from 
the naso-pharyngeal surfaces and glands of 
scrofulous subjects. In like manner the im- 
portance of a constitutional factor in leucor- 
rhceal cases is also apparent in females suf- 
fering from chlorosis, anaemia, and other 
forms of debility, and in whom blennor- 
rhagic vaginal hypersecretions that cannot 
be traced to any local lesion, and evidently 
consequent on general impairment of vas- 
cular tonicity, are so often noticed. In other 
instances, again, the constitutional cause of 
leucorrhcea is proven by its occurrence as a 
direct consequence of arrested lactation, or 
as a metastasis of gouty or rheumatic dis- 
orders. Still more obvious in this connection 
is the so-called amenorrhceal form of leucor- 
rhcea, in which we find the suppression of 
menstruation attended by more or less non- 
haemorrhagic discharges from the vagina and 
endometrium. 

Of the many factors concerned in the aeti- 
ology of leucorrhcea, none are of greater im- 
portance or more frequent occurrence than 
the various lesions, catarrhal, inflammatory, 
traumatic, hyperplastic, infective, and malig- 
nant, by any of which, as well as by constitu-

St primarily 
hypersecretion of the bland crystalline mucus 
which is norma red from the mucipa- 

rous follicles and epithelial surfaces of the 
rugous portion of the cervical canal. This, 
under pathological conditions, becomes grad- 
ually altered in character as well as in quan- 
tity, and eventuates in that viscid glutinous 
or bird-lime-like discharge, frequently acrid 
in alkalinity, which may be seen coating the 
lips of a lacerated cervix in instances 
of chr-mic cicatricial e'etropium, or extruding 
• from the os uteri in cases of endocervicitis. 
If traced further up, that exudation will then 
be found, as was clearly described by Tyler 
Smith, adhering closely to the cervical crypts 
and rugae, so as to fill the canal, and consist- 
ing chiefly of mucous corpuscles, oil globules, 
dentated epithelial cells, with which are also 
not infrequently found blood-disks and pus- 
corpuscles, enveloped in a thick transparent 
plasma, closely resembling raw white of egg, 
remarkable for its tenacity, alkaline in its re- 
action, and thus contrasting distinctly with 
the thin acid secretions of the vaginal mucous 
membrane. 

These exudations may originate either 
from the sinous fossae lined with cylindrical 
epithelium, between the plicae palmate on 
the anterior and posterior walls of the cervix, 
which may be regarded as the secretory 
organs of the normal viscid crystalline mucus 
of the cervical canal, or from the so-called 
ovula Xabothi in the same region. The 
latter vesicles, composed of connective tissue 
and cylindrical epithelium, may, perhaps, 
like the Graafian follicles, be regarded as 
closed glandular vesicles, bursting periodi- 
cally, though possibly, as Kollicker observed, 
they "are nothing more than dilated and 
closed mucous follicles, and in part also 
pathological new formations." Be this as it 
may, however, the muciparous follicles, closed

tive disease from the possibility of septic

their viscidity and alkalinity are most dis- 
tinctly abnormal, are of direct pathological 
moment as frequent sources of irritation a 
erosion of the cervix, and above all are of 
special interest in reference to the causa-i 
tion of sterility. The latter point is one

(by the secretion being so hyper-alkaline an

the thorough curetting of the cervical canal, 
so as to destroy the diseased secretory sur- 
face, as well as to clear the passage from the 
mechanical obstacles presented by its morbid 
exudations. 

In*reference to the general pathology and 
therapeutics of the conditions leading to cer- 
vical leucorrhcea, I may observe that, in the 
old "Dublin Obstetrical Transactions," up- 
wards of twenty years ago, I pointed out 
their common connection with constitutional, 
and more especially with strumous, diseases, 
and urged the importance of conjoining con- 
stitutional treatment with whatever local 
measures might be necessary in such cases. 
In a more recent work* I again endeavored 
to enforce this still neglected truth, in. which, 
however, I have since discovered that I 
had been anticipated by the late Tyler 
Smith, to some of whose views on the aetiol- 
ogy of leucorrhcea I have already referred. 
As Tyler Smith is one of the first and 
ablest exponents of the importance of consti- 
tutional treatment in leucorrhceal cases, and 
as his papers in the Lancet on leucorrhcea, 
though republished in his work on that sub- 
ject five years subsequently, are probably not 
familiar to many at the present day, his re- 
marks on this point may be here very briefly 
summarized. 

The glandular structure of the parts, he 
says, whence the discharge arises, points to 
the influence of constitutional causes, and 
exemplifies why this affection should be so 
common in women of strumous habit and 
leuco-phlegmatic temperament. Moreover, 
it vindicates the importance of constitutional 
treatment, and directs attention to the more 
rational employment of topical remedies, it 
being evident that, although leucorrhcea of 
the cervical canal is sometimes cured by the 
use of caustics to the os uteri, in these cases 
they act as counter-irritants to the glandular 
structure. The indications of treatment, based 
on a knowledge of the minute anatomy of the 
os and cervix uteri, and the study of their pa- 
thology in leucorrhcea, show the importance 
of combining constitutional medicines and 
regimen with local applications, which, to be 
of any use in cervical leucorrhcea, should 



be applied, not to the vagina, nor to the os 
uteri, but to the canal of the cervix. 

The latter object may, I think, be most 
readily and effectively carried out by the 
employment of the curette, and for this pur- 
pose I have found Duke's dull-wire cervical 
curette most useful in the thorough removal 
of that viscid, tenacious discharge by which 
the canal is blocked in cases of cervical leu- 
corrhcea, without any risk of too deep a de- 
nudation of the walls of the passage. Before 
employing this or any other curette, however, 
I generally find it advisable to dilate the 
canal freely by the two-bladed dilator which 
I have shown on previous occasions; and, in 
my practice, immediately after curettage, the 
denuded endocervical surface is brushed over 
with iodized phenol, the patency of the pas- 
sage being subsequently maintained by the 
use of bougies. 

Such local measures should, generally 
speaking, as before observed, be conjoined 
with constitutional treatment, and more espe- 
cially with those remedies specially indicated 
by the strumous diathesis so frequently 
noticeable in patients suffering from chronic 
leucorrhceal discharges. Without again en- 
larging on this point, it may be enough here 
to say that in the way of general treatment, 
in the majority of these cases, the physician 
must rely chiefly on those ferruginous tonics 
— such as iodide, phosphite, or hypophos- 
phite of iron — which, with mineral acids, 
quinine, cod-liver oil, and malt prepara- 
tions, are — in conjunction with suitable 
hygienic and dietetic measures — his ordi- 
nary resources in all strumous disorders. 
The only drug which would appear to me 
to have anything like a special or even a 
commonly remedial effect in ordinary chronic 
leucorrhceal cases is arsenic and its combina- 
tions, such as Donovan's solution, from which, 
when administered in small and long-con- 
tinued doses, I have unquestionably experi- 
enced much benefit in the treatment of many 
cases of this kind.

Editorial. 



WHAT IS THE MEANING? 

We quote the following from a Washington 
paper of recent date: 

The the Columbia Chemical Company 

were made the subject yesterday of lively litiga- 
tion. William A. Hammond, who has been iden- 
tified with the Company one way or another since 
: mation, brought a petition for injunction 
5t the officers to prevent the use of his name 
on certain advertisements for the sale of animal 
extracts, on the charge that these advertisements, 
run in several papers, were becoming offensive. 
The Company filed a similar petition for an 
injunction against Hammond and the Hammond 
Sanitarium to prevent the manufacture by him of 
the animal extr 

Hammoi in his petition that certain 

radons or medicines from animal extracts 

were first discovered by him and announced in New 

York • lecture and subsequently in the 

irnals. . . He wants the court to 

scept in such manner 

as he may appr 

The petition filed by the Columbia Chemical 

states that Hammond was given 24,995 

of the 50,0 k in the Company for his 

and interest in the discovery, and that he 

um. They 

s executed last September by 

which Hammond was to receive a of ten 

irachms of the extract manu- 

one-half 1 Janu- 

.-• has also given them t: 

in this line which he 
might make. It is that Ham- 

Hutchins 
e the sam 
for the pany and to put 

them on the market. 

In view of the fact that the name of "the 
Great Retired " h antly appeared in 



mammoth letters in the advertising columns 

of the daily press through North A;: 

many months, it would seem eminently 

proper that this modest gentleman should at 

• of havn ■ 1 un- 

due notoriety. Fully appreciating his setir- 
ing disposition, we felt inclined to extend to 
him our sympathy under this persecution and 
press the hope he would obtain due 
redress in the courts. But then th&lt; 
query: Did all this have "a tail" to it 3 It 
seems strange that this individual, who has 
been somewhat famous for not allowing his 
right hand to know what the left under 
should, so to speak, be pitting the d&lt; 
against its sinister fellow. Again, the exhi- 
bition of modesty which is so characteristic 
appears to be a little late in coming, and it is 
very natural to associate therewith a failure 
in realization of " filthy lucre " as anticipated. 

But a subsequent issue of the same 1. 
paper appears somewhat explanatory. It de- 
clares that at a hearing of this suit the attorney 
of the Only Great " maintained that advertise- 
ments which were inserted in many new 
pers in different parts of the country were 
offensive and indecent and tended to brand 
his client as a vender of quack medicine- 
stigma which has been pretty thoroughly 
endorsed from Hudson's Bay to the Gulf, and 
from the Atlantic to the Pacific); while the 
Company's counsel informs the public that 
Hammond, realizing at last that the animal- 
extract business is not the howling success 
anticipated, endeavored to force the 1 
pany to purchase his stock at his own 
ire. 

There is an old "saw" to th&lt; that 

when certain classes of individuals fall out, 
more reputable members of the community 
get their dues. How far this will prove true* 
in the present case remains to I I, but 

the Columbia Chemical Company in their 
answer and arguments declare that I 
mond and the vice-president of the Com- 
\\\ P. Springer, quarreled, when the 
declared he would in future disap- 
prove all advertisemen i should bear 
his name: and fir ... said Hammond 
sed of his stock, for which he asked the 
ubia Chemical Company §25,000, for

ness were mad- st the plaintiff touching

facture of the so called remedies. 

The suit of the Chemical Company against 
the Great Retired and his Sanitarium Com- 
pany was set down for a later date. 



flORBUS BRIGHTII. 

It is possible for the enlightened practi- 
tioner not only to check the milder forms of 
renal disease, but even to control and miti- 
gate the symptoms that arise from more 
severe maladies of the same class; it is, how- 
ever, a notorious fact that, in spite of the 
boasted progress of the last quarter-century, 
little of real value has accrued to renal thera- 
peutics — while new remedies galore have 
been heralded, these with few exceptions 
have proved inferior to those of greater age, 
and the drawback to advance in this particu- 
lar direction may be laid at the door of rapid 
exploitation of medicaments without ade- 
quate study and investigation, due to the 
multiplying of synthetics and other coal-tar 
derivatives. 

The chief demand in kidney trouble is, 
an absolutely correct diagnosis— everything 
hinges upon this. Next, to give rest to the 
diseased organ by reducing its labors to a 
minimum, which may be done by promoting 
the vicarious action of the other emunctories 
of the economy. 

The three great channels whereby it is 
possible to remove excrementitious material 
that normally falls to the lot of the renal 
organs to eliminate, are: The bowels; the 
skin; and, the lungs. By stimulating the 
action of these, it is possible not only to re- 
move for a time a portion of the labor from 
the overtaxed kidney, but in more advanced 
cases to materially disburden the patient of 
dropsical accumulation, thereby securing ap- 
preciable relief and comfort; and thus even 
may be mitigated the more distressing symp- 
toms ordinarily included under the title of 
"uraemic intoxication" — symptoms that are, 
properly speaking, the direct results of reten- 
tion in the circulation of excrementitious 
products, organic as well as inorganic, which 
it is the business of the kidney to excrete. 

The skin and respiratory organs are much 
more powerful auxiliaries in the elimination 
of the urinary product than is, perhaps, gen- 



erally supposed. Cutaneous transpiration 
removes not only aqueous fluid but many 
organic and inorganic salts; even in health 
the perspiration contains urea, uric acid, 
phosphates, and chlorides, while in diseased 
conditions many abnormal compounds, even 
to insoluble oxalate of lime, are excreted by 
this means. Pulmonary exhalation, judi- 
ciously stimulated, also may be made of 
equal service, since in the expired air of the 
healthy may be detected urea, uric acid, and 
urates of soda and ammonia. The great 
dependence, however, must be placed upon 
vicarious action of the intestines, which may 
be induced by mild or drastic cathartics, 
according to the constitution and needs of 
the individual sufferer. Where there is much 
anasarca, Elaterium is perhaps one of the 
best of purgatives, though the mistake is 
often made of administering it alone, when 
it is particularly apt to bring on an exhaust- 
ing diarrhoea, especially if the manifestations 
of uraemia are already prominent. — It may 
be here remarked that the untoward action 
of elaterium may usually be controlled by 
combining with minute doses of belladonna 
or fuller ones of hyoscyamus. 

While warm, vapor or hot-air baths may 
sufficiently stimulate vicarious action of the 
skin, it will sometimes be found advantageous, 
if not absolutely necessary, to further en- 
courage diaphoresis by the internal adminis- 
tration of appropriate sudonfics; the rela- 
tive values of vapor and hot-air baths are 
about equal in increasing cutaneous, and 
also pulmonary, elimination of urinary prod- 
ucts, though this is perhaps best observed 
under the latter. — And here it may be 
w 7 ell to observe that the too often mani- 
fested tendency of the practitioner to en- 
deavor to diminish the urinous odor of the 
breath and perspiration, in cases of advanced 
kidney disease, is greatly to be reprehended; 
such should at all times be promoted, for it is 
essential to assist Nature in every laudable 
effort to rid the circulation of deleterious 
agents that are gradually but surely extin- 
guishing the life of the sufferer. 

Though antiphlogistics are no longer fash- 
ionable, and few of the younger practitioners 
understand their proper administration and 
management, they are certainly of more 
direct service in all forms of inflammatory

ranked among the antiphlogistics, is

wili afford a maximum of relief; it should, 
ver, be employed in large ,:id its 

action is much more pleasant if combined 
with some antispasmodic, such, for instance, 
as camphor monobromide. As high as thirty, 
forty, or even more grains have been admin- 
istered at a single dose with most excellent 
resuits, and notably such high dosage is fol- 
lowed by none of the depressing effects that 
are a constant concomitant of doses of twenty 
grains and under — the effect of these large 
doses upon the renal organs, far from being 
" heroic," is most magically soothing. 

Regarding the employment of diuretics; It 
should never be forgotten that in the first 
stage of all inflammatory or congestive at- 
tacks occurring in the course of chronic renal 
affections, diuretics are totally inadmissible; 
second, when such are indicated, great care 
must always be observed in selection, since 
the one remedy in this class which will prove 
beneficial in a particular form and at a par- 
ticular stage of kidney disease, will often be 
productive of actual harm when administered 
in another form or in another stage of the 
same attack; thus, when the albuminuria is 
the result of active congestion, a combina- 
tion of bitartrate of potash and an infusion 
of digitalis proves eminently satisfactory, 
whereas in the absence of active congestion, 
and more especially when the vital powers of 
the patient are low, such will be of little effi- 
cacy, the demand being for a diuretic of more 
stimulating character. The reason why di- 
uretics often are a positive harm in acute 
kidney affections will be readily understood 



whei. led the fact that, in the main, 

they have a tendency to ii .ther than 

diminish the flow of blood to the alread' 

gorged organ. 

In this eon: may likewise be men- 

tioned the fact that digitalis, tincture or fluid 
extra I ntly fails to promote dil 

while the infusion is almost invariably din] 

: consequently it would appear tl 
S of fluid is very essential to activity. 

rial liquid digitalis, abundantly diluted 
with warm or hot water at the moment of 
administration, usually offers all the advan- 

S that accrue to the infusion or decoction^ 
and likewise presents the special advantage 
of uniformity and certainty of dosage, 
results, too, are to be obtained through such 
commonplace remedies as aconite in small 
and oft-repeated doses for its soothing ( 
digitalis; caffeine; cannabis Indica; muriate 
tincture of iron; with such occasional resort 
to diaphoretics and cathartics as the individ- 
ual case may warrant. 



THAT HAY-FEVER CURE. 

The old " chestnut," Fuber's so called 
" cure for hay fever," that was so thoroughly 
exploited two years ago in both the lay and 
the medical press, is again going the rounds. 
No less than seven medical exchanges, re- 
ceived in one day, give space thereto, ap- 
parently ignorant of the fact that each and 
every one published the same in either 1893 
or 1894; and now it is credited to T/ie Med' 
ical Reporter, Calcutta, a journal that 1 
only in vivid imaginations. It is the old 
story of "rubbing the ears until they are 
hot," thereby freeing the nasal mucous mem- 
brane from congestion. It is hardly 1 
sary to add that the whole thing is — simply 

rubbish !

EDITORIAL NOTES. 



Quackery Abroad.— 

It has been the custom to regard the 
United States as the great dumping-ground 
for quacks. It is not to be denied there is an 
immense amount of inferior medical talent in 
this country, and it is somewhat notorious a 
large portion of such in the States border-

ng upon Canada is derived from the latter, 
)eing made up of individuals who were 
inable to exhibit the necessary educational 
qualification for study at home. The Empire 
)f Germany has been repeatedly held up to 
is as a region where quackery was an impos- 
sibility, yet the returns in the Kingdom of 
Bavaria show that in 1893 there were 1,152 
iharlatans practicing, against 1,184 m l8 92; 
)f these, 1,097 were Bavarians, 32 Germans, 
[9 Austrians, 2 Americans, 1 Italian, and 1 
Swiss — a fairly polyglot assembly. 

Tapping the^Heart.— 

In the Edinburgh Medical Journal, Doctor 
AJan T. Sloan reports a case in which, 
;hrough accident, he pushed an aspirator 
needle into the right ventricle of the heart. 
The patient not only recovered, but was 
:ompletely relieved of a long-standing rheu- 
matism. 

There have been other cases of accidental 
puncture when the intended operation was 
•eally paracentesis of the pericardium — in 
1872 Roger reports entering the right ven- 
tricle of a child suffering from pericardic 
effusion, and drawing off six ounces of blood; 
the patient, as in Doctor Sloan's case, re- 
bovered from the operation. 

Leprosy in India. — 

The Government of India has just made 
ipublic its opinion regarding the recommenda- 
tion of the Leprosy Commission. It con- 
siders the extent to which the malady is 
propagated by contagion to be small, and 
itherefore cannot approve of compulsory seg- 
regation, either absolute or partial, except 
among leper vagrants. The Government 
expresses its conviction that the alarm con- 
cerning the increase of leprosy in India is 
groundless; the statistics show there are less 
than 127,000 lepers in the entire Indian pen- 
insula. 

Teratologia.— 

Such is the title of a quarterly journal re- 
cently instituted by Doctor J. W. Ballantyne, 
of Edinburgh, Scotland, and published by 
Williams &amp; Norgate, 20 South Frederick 
street, same city. As its name indicates, it 
[deals with congenital maladies and ante- 
natal pathology — manifestly a large field. 



Not the least of its advantages is the com- 
plete review, given in each number, of cur- 
rent literature bearing upon teratological 
topics 

Renal Calculus.— 

Before a recent session of the Liverpool 
Medical Society Mr. Larkin gave the notes 
of a case of renal calculus in a woman, the 
symptoms closely resembling those of anal 
fissure. There were no symptoms referable 
to the kidneys, except a trace of pus in the 
urine and, as discovered by palpation under 
chloroform, slight enlargement of the right 
kidney. She was completely relieved by re- 
moval of the calculus. 

Penny Wise, Pound Foolish.— 

Certain of the insurance companies of New 
York have reduced the medical examiner's 
fee from $5 to $3; some even threaten to cut 
to a lower figure. The result is that such 
companies are losing a corps of experienced 
examiners, who are being replaced by cheap 
medical talent. Manifestly this will react 
upon the companies. 

Very Bad Indeed.— 

The Ohio Medical Journal declares that 
"the facts respecting the water supply of 
Cincinnati are too loathsome to print in a 
magazine which circulates outside of that 
city." 

What excellent stomachs the citizens of 
Porkopolis must possess ! But they have the 
option of beer. 

Homoeopathic Acumen.— 

The most successful, financially and cura- 
tively, among the esteemed "regular" breth- 
ren, are those who give ho?nceopathic medicines 
on ho7nceopathic principles [Italics ours. —Ed. 
Age.]. — Hom&amp;opathic Recorder. 

Great Hevings !— 

" Health came like an avalanche in the 
Mountains of the Moon !" 

This is the "poetical license" of an "ori- 
ficial " writer.

This is suggested as a scientific title for 
stammering.

Recovers of Hearing After Long Deafness. 

ged thirty-five y&gt; 

said to have been deaf from the age of nine 

-. and when first &gt;een heard DOthi 
either meal » closure of Eustachian 

tubes. Daily Politzerization was instituted, 
and in one week she heard, at one-half inch, 
ebly ticking watch; in three weeks at 
three inches; and after three months, hear- 
ing became normal. The case is recorded 
as remarkable for the extent of the recovery 
after so long a period of deafness, and to 
encourage tentative treatment in apparently 
confirmed cases of deafness. The mental 
development has been most marked since 
hearing has been established. Before treat- 
ment she was a good lip-reader, and could 
make use of a limited number of words. 
after restoration of hearing, she is 
obliged to learn the alphabet of sound. At 
first she could not understand aural conver- 
sation at all, but now understands many 
words when spoken slowly. Her education 
has been greatly neglected. — Doctor F. F. 
WHITE, in British Medical Journal. 

Cholera and the Comma Bacilli.— 

In the scientific memoirs by medical officers 
of India appears a paper on "The Results of 
Continued Study of Various Forms of the 
Comma Bacilli Occurring in Calcutta," by 
Brigade-Surgeon Lieutenant-Colonel D. I). 
Cunningham, F.R.S., CLE. It will be re- 
membered that Doctor Cunningham is one of 
those cited as giving evidence in favor of the 
comma bacilli— a citation which is far from 
correct, since an imperfect report of his was 
accepted as positive evidence when such was 
only intended to be preliminary. In this 
paper Doctor Cunningham emphatically de- 
clares that cholera in Calcutta is not invari- 
ably characterized by the presence of any 
cultivable comma bacilli in the intestinal 
contents, and that even in cases where such 
organisms are present they by no means in- 
variably give the characteristics described by 
Koch and ordinarily accepted as belonging 
to true cholera bacilli, but differ greatly in 
different instances both as regards their 
morphological and physiological properties. 
— Homoeopathic Recorder. 

Diphtheria and Its Associates. — 

This is the title of a work by Mr. Lennox 
Brown which will soon be issued simultane- 
ously from the press of the J. B. Lippincott Co., 
Philadelphia, and Messrs Bailliere, Tindall &amp; 
Cox, London, with promise of most complete 



Diphtheria will be &lt;

health, bacterioli g 

experience; the information from all these 
sour&lt; isidered essential to a right 

appreciation, alike of the etiology, diagnosis, 
treatment, and prevention of tl bating 

malady. The subject of antitoxin will be 
treated of in an appendix. The book will 
be illustrated with that completeness and ex- 
cellence that are always to be expected 
Mr. Lennox Brown, who is ever his owl 
artist, and a novel feature will be introduced 
by placing the portraits of the throat a~ 
at the bedside in juxtaposition with the 
photo-micrographs of the special organisms 
that characterize each case.

To shorten the thermic fat; 
And hand me the oxygen bottle, ma, 

And look at the thermostat; 
And if the electric oven's cold 

Just turn it on half an ohm, 
For I want to have supper ready 

As soon as John comes home. 

Now, pass me the neutral dope, mamma, 

And rotate the mixing machine, 
But give me the sterilized water first

And the phosphate, too, for, now I think, 

The new typewriter's quit. 
And John will need more phosphate food 

To help his brain a bit.

Education of the Masses.— 

The following delicious scientific (?) para- 
graph is taken from a journal with enormous 
circulation, and produced ostensibly with i 
view to the instruction, elevation, and amaze 
ment of an ignorant proletariat:

sibly feel inclined to deduce inferences un 
favorable to the future welfare of the deceased 
on observing the issuance of "steam" from a 
blister. — Provincial Medical Journal.

Vhat He Should Take.— 

I A magistrate of Edinburgh, contemporary 

rith "Lang Sandy Wood," the eminent phy- 

jician, planned how to get from the latter a 

Inscription without a fee. Taking advan- 

age of a custom of the time, he invited Sandy 

, o take his meridian with him in a " change 

house" near the Cross. Over the wine he 

fjave a long account of his ailments, to which 

■|Vood listened in grim silence. At last he 

put the direct question: "Doctor, what do 

Lou think I should tak' ?" "Tak'!" exclaimed 

&gt;andy, "why, if ye're as ill as ye say, I think 

i'e should tak' medical advice." 

Something to be Thankful For.— 

A Scotch lady invited an elder in the Free 
Iphurch to have supper with her, and a piece 

)f remarkably tough veal was placed on the 
! ;able. After some frantic endeavors to cut, 
r luring which the elder's plate landed on his 
f cnees, the lady said: "Ye aye said there wis 

something to be thankfu' for in everything; 
||[ jalouse ye wud be at a loss to fin' something 
|':o be thankfu' for in that veal ?" " Not at a'," 
I ae responded, cheerfully, stopping to breathe; 
I'l wis just thinking hoo gratefu' we should 
i be that we met with it when it was young." 

| Catgut Sutures. — 

One objection to the use of catgut is, that 
Jin handling with wet hands, or when it is 
j|soiled with blood or pus, it becomes slippery, 
land one does not feel sure that a knot tied 
lldown in the bottom of the pelvis will hold. 
j ( In order to obviate this objection, Doctor 
■Gushing, of San Francisco, after rendering 
f this catgut aseptic, puts it into a mixture of 
r an ounce of common resin to a pint of alco- 
I hoi. He has found this mixture to preserve 
Ijcatgut, and to make it stick w so that it will 
■stay tied. — Medical Record. 

i Gallant Action of an Army Surgeon at Chitral.— 

Surgeon-Captain H. F. Whitchurch, at- 
tached to the 24th * Bengal Native Infantry, 
I performed a feat of exceptional gallantry on 
lithe occasion of the reconnaissance of March 
■3d from Fort Chitral. Captain Baird fell 
Ijmortally wounded, but Surgeon-Captain 
\ 'Whitchurch, although running serious danger 
I of death or capture by the enemy, would not 
[[abandon him, but, carrying the wounded 
ffofticer on his back, fought his way back to 
'the fort. — Medical Press and Circular. 

I Inebriates.— 

The report of the Departmental Division 
[ on Prisons (Great Britain) marks a very im- 
hportant advance toward the solution of the 



problem of chronic drunkenness. It is de- 
clared that the present system of "sending 
up" an inebriate time after time for short 
periods is all wrong; that he ought to be 
treated as an ill man and committed to an 
asylum for a considerable period in order to 
have a chance to recover. — Medical Press 
and Circular. 

Association of Military Surgeons. — 

This organization, after a very successful 
meeting at Buffalo on the 23d ult., adjourned 
to meet in 1896 in Philadelphia. The officers 
for the ensuing year are: Lewis W. Read, of 
Pennsylvania, President; Albert Gihon, U. 
S. N., First Vice-President; C. H. Alden, As- 
sistant Surgeon-General U. S. A., Second 
Vice-President; E. Chancellor, of St. Louis, 
Secretary; Lawrence C. Carr, Cincinnati, 
.Treasurer. 

Advance in Petroleum. — 

This gives interest to the question of ex- 
haustibility of the supply following close 
upon the great decrease of available natural 
gas. In the height of the natural gas excite- 
ment the warning of science was too little 
heeded, and lavish waste hastened the col- 
lapse. In 1887 the atmosphere of Pittsburgh 
was wonderfully clear, owing to the use of 
this new fuel. But Pittsburgh is again be- 
grimed and sooty. — Nature. 

After the Bath 

According to Le Merer edi Me'dical, Max 
Edel, a German bacteriologist, took a bath 
and then examined the water for microbes; 
he found that it contained 5,850,000,000! 
After a bath of one foot only, he estimated 
the number of microbes at 180,000,000. 

The question now arises: When did Edel 
have his last previous bath ? — Medical Record. 

Good Reason for Care! —

Pi-pounder: "Quite so, Mrs. McTurk. I

there is so much adul-therry goin' on." — 
Mississippi Medical Monthly. 

A Case for Tears.— 

Teasing Friend: "What makes that new 
baby at your house cry so much, Tommy?" 

Tommy (indignantly): "It don't cry so 
very much — and any way, if all your teeth 
was out, and your hair off, and your legs so 
weak you couldn't stand on them, I guess 
you'd feel like crying yourself."

llled every week with fresh, entertaining, 
practical, and accurate information for all 



who love nature or take an interest in trees, 
shrubs, and flowers. It figures new plants, 
and describes new horticultural processes; it 
is a current record of all practice and prog- 
ress in the parks and groves and forests of 
the world. It is indispensable not only to 
the practical horticulturist, botanist, land- 
scape-gardener, and forester, but to every 
owner of a country or suburban home who 
desires information in all branches of orna- 
mental and economic planting. 



The Elements of Botany. By Asa Gray. Cloth; 
i6mo; pp. 3S6. American Book Co., New York 
and Chicago. 

This work consists of " Lessons in Botany," 
and the "Field, Forest and Garden Botany," 
bound together in one complete volume, 
forming a most popular and comprehensive 
text-book adapted to use either for reference 
or teaching; in fact, it has no equal as a hand- 
book whereby to analyze plants and flowers 
in field-study of botany. Beginning with the 
first principles it progresses by easy stages 
to the most intricate portions of botanical 
science. It is likewise a grammar and dic- 
tionary of botany and comprises the common 
herbs, shrubs and trees of the Northern, 
Southern and Middle States and of Ontario 
and Quebec, including those commonly culti- 
vated as well as native species in fields, gar- 
dens, pleasure grounds, and house culture; 
even the ordinary conservatory plants are 
listed and described. 

This work supplies a great desideratum to 
the botanist and botanical teacher, and is 
especially available for the library of Ameri- 
can physicians who, unfortunately, rarely 
have that familiarity with botany which is 
so carefully inculcated in those educated 
abroad. 



The Practice of Medicine. By Edwin M. Hale.

This work is very complete, and, though 
intended more especially for practitioners of 
homoeopathy, is by no means an exponent of 
a special system of medicine, but exhibits a 
most liberal tendency toward what its author 
styles the " old school." The views ex- 
pressed are most practical, and while Doctor 
Hale is at times somewhat dogmatic, such is 
the dogmatism of emphasis and honest con- 
viction. He endeavors to teach medicine on 
the basis of a universal science rather than 
as a specialism. His descriptions of the 
clinical phenomena of disease are terse and 
to the point, and made especially interesting 
by numerous historical references not usually

This is uniform with other numbers of the 
" Medical Practitioners' Library" emanating 
from these well known publishers. Just now 
when so much interest is felt in the subject 
of serum-therapy, this volume becomes of 
special interest to the medical profession, 
particularly in that it is the work of one who 
cvoted his life to the study of bacteri- 
and its application to medicine. The 
author gives a summary of the most import- 
ant experimental evidence in the field of 
research to which this work relates. Little 
space, however, is given over to the discus- 
sion of moot questions connected with this 
subject — which, perhaps, is an advantage 
rather than otherwise. As a matter of fact, 
however, the most important results of ex- 
periment made by experienced bacteriologists 
have been concisely stated.

This is a companion work to the Psycho- 
pathia Sexualis of Krafft-Ebing, and is ren- 
dered into English by the same translator, 
&gt;r Charles G. Chaddock, of St. Louis. 

There is a great deal that is of interest 
embodied, yet we hardly realize any practical 
advantage to be obtained from it over and 
above the previous work by Krafft-Ebing. It 
is, however, a very desirable contribution 
to the subject to tho^e who are interested in 
its literature.

still be recognized as a notable man who did 
not fail to leave his impress upon American

Therapeutic Brevities, 



Leucorrhcea in the Unmarried. — In the 
eatment of leucorrhoea in young unmarried 
omen, instances frequently occur in which 
le usual practice of making an examination 
ascertain the condition of the pelvic 
iscera is so obnoxious to the patient, or so 
rmly opposed, that the physician is forced 
&gt; abandon it and have recourse to medicine. 
In such cases, Doctor Slocum [Cincinnati 
ancet- Clinic) depends upon the specific ae- 
on which Cantharides appears to exercise 
pon the cells constituting the genital as 
ell as the urinary system. It is probable 
iat, by direct stimulation of the cells just to 
le point of successful resistance, the benefit 
secured, as the dose is very small. Stran- 
ury or other unpleasant symptom has not 
ien produced. The action of the drug has 
;en so uniformly satisfactory that when it 
ils such result forms a strong basis for sus- 
ecting the presence of something more than 
mply hyperemia or mild inflammation, 
essening of the discharge is sometimes 
Dted within five days, but in several cases of 
rofuse discharge of four years' and longer 
uration the treatment was not successful 
ntil after a month's persistent use. 
The formula which has seemed the best is: 

Tincture of cantharides, 96 minims. 
Tincture ferric chloride, 160 minims. 
Dilute phosphoric acid, 160 minims. 
Syrup of lemon, 2 fluidounces. 
Water, sufficient to make 4 ounces. 

One teaspoonful, in water, after meals.

The Treatment of Obesity. — In the May 15 th 
sue of the Atnerican Medico-Surgical Bulletin 
ppears a paper by Doctor Frederick Gutt- 
lann on " The Treatment of Obesity," in 
hich the use of Thyreoidin tablets is re- 
lorted. Five cases are cited in which the 
isults were extremely beneficial, the final 
ne being the author himself, who between 
lay 12th and September 27th reduced his 
eight from 247 to 227 pounds under an 
verage dose daily of ten grains of Thy- 
ioidin. He was obliged to begin the treat- 
ment with two-grain doses three times daily, 
rdering likewise a diet of meat and fruits 
'ith no alcohol and little or no water. Doc- 
')r Guttmann concludes: 

" I have come to regard the thyroid gland 
f the sheep as a ' specific' in obesity; one 
Hat is free from the dangerous and injurious 
fter-effects, and whose beneficial effects ap- 



pear within a few months from the beginning 
of the treatment. The only risk is in begin- 
ning with large doses, as palpitations and 
fainting fits are possible until the patient is 
well accustomed to the drug. The agent, 
however, is not to be used indiscriminately. 
The Thyreoidin has likewise given excellent 
results in acromegaly, myxcedema, Basedow's 
disease, and various cutaneous affections. I 
have tried thyroid gland in pulverized form, 
and the Thyreoidin of Parke, Davis &amp; Co., 
and greatly prefer the latter." 



Chronic Aural Catarrh. — The most fre- 
quent cause of deafness is catarrh of the 
naso-pharynx (nose and throat), as a result 
of which either the disease extends by conti- 
nuity of surface through the Eustachian 
tubes, or the presence of hypertrophies and 
other lesions of naso-pharyngeal disease 
interferes with the normal blood-supply of 
the tubes and middle ear. It is a most un- 
fortunate circumstance that chronic catarrh 
of the middle ear is ordinarily a painless 
affection, unaccompanied by more disagree- 
able symptoms than occasional noises in the 
ears and gradually increasing deafness, for 
it is largely in consequence of this fact that 
Von Troltsch long ago was able to state as the 
result of his investigations that at least one 
man in three past adult life had impaired 
hearing in one or both ears. If chronic catarrh 
of the middle ear were not so insidious and 
painless an affection, it would not be allowed 
to progress in so many instances until its vic- 
tim was hopelessly deaf or could at most hope 
to have his hearing partially restored only as 
the result of somewhat uncertain operations. 
It should hence be considered an important 
part of aural hygiene that naso-pharyngeal 
disease should receive proper attention before 
progressing sufficiently to impair the integ- 
rity of the middle ear. — Brief. 



Croton Oil for Ringworm. — An epidemic of 
ringworm, of the variety tricophyton megalo- 
sporon endothrix, occurred recently in an 
orphan asylum, forty-eight out of seventy 
children being affected. Croton oil, which 
is a destructive rather than a curative agent, 
was employed. — It requires to be carefully 
handled so as to regulate the amount of 
destruction, and never used for patches 
larger than a sixpence. It is necessary to 
first test the resistancy of the individual skin, 
hence a commencement is best made by ap- 
plying a drop of oil, which it is well to remem- 
ber exerts an effect beyond the spot to which 
it is applied; this is permitted to remain a

Tobacco- Smoking for Invalids. — In the ma- 
jority . cal affections smoking is per- 
ble, with the exception of convalescence 
operations upon the bladder and ab- 
domen. Patients with diseases of the 

throat or pharynx should never smoke. 
The internal diseases which will not permit 
smoking are peritonitis, typhoid fever, and 
similar affections. In stomach affections, 
smoking may be allowed if the smoke be 
filtered. Patients with organic heart dis- 
3 should smoke as little as possible. In 
lung . under certain circumstances, 

smoking is often beneficial; also to syphi- 
litics. In those with nervous diseases there 
is no general rule; sudden withdrawal often 
does harm, while in cardiac neuroses only a 
very weak tobacco with filtration of the 
smoke is allowable. To smoke in the sick- 
where there are several patients present 
lly to be commended. The best time 
to smoke is several hours after meals. —

Therapeutics of Menthol. — In hay fever, 
William Hill, of London, has found Menthol 
to serve an excellent purpose as a substitute 
for cocaine. He applies a ten- or twenty-per- 
cent, solution in olive or almond oil to the 
sensitive area within the nose by means of a 
brush or atomizer. In the chronic bronchitis 
of old age, Nyes speaks favorably of inhala- 
tions of Menthol, which, he says, not only 
facilitate and rapidly diminish the expectora- 
tion, but also allay the cough and reduce the 
number of paroxysms. These inhalations 
have aNo been used with good effect in 
whooping-cough. Finally, the same mode of 
application has proven useful in lore's hands 
in relieving asthma. Inhalations of a twenty- 
per-cent. solution in olive oil were then tried, 
with the most satisfactory results — the rat-

worst cases that have come under my notice 
have been able to walk in eight days from 
the time treatment began. — Doctor I i 

HURD. 



Cocaine Anozsthesia. — The danger from use 
of cocaine is very much lessened when era- 1 
ployed in minor operations if the drug 
jected in the subcutaneous cellular tissue in 
the region of the nerve trunk, instead of n&lt; 
the diseased tissues. The advantages of thi 
method are: It is not necessary to make the 
injection in the field of operation: Very ex- 
tensive areas of anaesthesia may be produced; 
by minute doses of cocaine: When the in- 
jection is made in the neighborhood of a 
nerve, both the skin and the deep tissin 
anaesthetized. These improved proceduresj 
will doubtless greatly increase the utility of| 
cocaine as an anaesthetic. — Doctor A. Kro- 
in Centralblatt fur Chirurgie. 



Tinnitus in Aural Sclerosis. — Doctor i 
Seiss recommends as the most advantageous 
methods of controlling "this never altogether 
curable disease:" Proper treatment of the 
nasopharynx first; methods directed t 
Eustachian tubes next; immediate local treat- 
ment of the tympanum last. The bes: 
of tubal medication in tinnitus of catarrhal 
origin consists in injections of some oleagi- 
nous fluid containing one-half grain of 
phor and two grains of menthol to the fluid- 
ounce, by means of the Eustachian catheter. 
Menthol vaporization is also recommended 
for allaying tinnitus dependent upon tubal 
congestion and inflammation. — Annals of 
Ophthalmology and Otology.

The Treatment of Diphtheria. — The early 
use of strong hydrochloric acid, especially in 
ases beginning on the tonsils: 

Local cleanliness by the use of a weak 
antiseptic solution in the pharynx: 

Nasal syringing with the same solutions in 
every case where there is nasal discharge:

Purgation in Gynaecological Diagnosis. — Doc- 
tor Baldy declares that the symptoms pre- 
sented by a woman whose pelvis is filled with 
aecal masses, and whose pelvic circulation is 
:onsequently impeded and rather sluggish, 
; are markedly different from those of one 
who has had these disturbing factors re- 
imoved. Many women return after the ad- 
ministration of an active purgative claiming 
[pat they are entirely well of their headaches, 
Ijback-aches, and abdominal pain. — Philadel- 
phia Polyclinic. 



Spigelia in Headache. — This drug is very 
(useful in left-sided facial neuralgia when the 
(infra-orbital and maxillary branches of the 
{fifth pair are involved. These pains are ten- 
[sive, burning, throbbing; are worse when 
[lying down and better when sitting up. Cold 
lor warm applications assist in relieving. Oc- 
casionally the pain is as if red-hot needles 
pierced the skin, and it comes and goes sud- 
denly. — Doctor S. F. Shannon, in Homoeo- 
pathic News. 



Constipation. — Do not let your mind dwell 
upon podophyllin, magnesia salts, and the 
[like, but prescribe normal liquid Nux Vomica, 
jone drop in half a glass of water every night 
at bedtime. This will effectually relieve 
[many cases of habitual constipation. — Ex-

Strychnine. — In paraplegia of reflex origin, 
sin rheumatismal paraplegia, in syphiloma of 
ithe spinal meninges, paraplegia continuing 
[after the removal of the deposits, according 
; to Bartholow, Strychnine is a most service- 
able remedy. — Medical Review. 



Gleet. — Chlorate of potash, in one- to two- 
per-cent. solution, is an excellent injection 



for gleet. A weak solution of permanganate 
of potash is also often beneficial. For in- 
ternal administration, nitric acid and thuja 
are advised. — Monatsblatter. 



Tincture of Iron Made Pleasant. — Doctor 
C. Klippel gives muriate tincture of iron in 
seltzer water. This makes an exceedingly 
pleasant drink and overcomes the tendency 
to constipation so often complained of by 
patients taking iron. 



Abortion. — Here Asafcetida is very useful, 
besides being harmless to the general system. 
It is valuable in any of the nervous symp- 
toms incident to pregnancy, and best given 
in pill form. — Le Progres Medical. 



Euthymcl will be found a most valuable 
adjuvant to the diarrhoea mixtures prescribed 
for children with entero-colitis and kindred 
troubles. As an internal antiseptic it is un- 
excelled. — Medical Times. 



Aralia Racemosa. — This remedy is useful 
in asthma, and is often of exceeding benefit 
in so-called "hay fever." In cough, spas- 
modic in character, it is also beneficial. — 
Homoeopathic Annual. 



Diphtheria. — Lemon-juice is said to exert 
a powerful influence upon the micro-organ- 
isms of diphtheria. The remedy is certainly 
simple and not disagreeable to use. — New 
York Medical Tunes.

tempting to make a case in defense of the 
traffic, when on a sudden the attention of 
both was roused by a sound of footsteps 
rapidly approaching the door, which was im- 
mediately burst open by a heavy blow. A 
piercing shriek came from the mother, who 
rushed into the adjoining bed-room; the 
daughter started and turned towards the 
cause of the noise and her mother's fright, 
and saw what she afterwards described as the 
phantom of a negro slave lying on the floor, 
which turned its ghastly head and glared for 
a moment upon her with white protruding 
eyeballs. A figure in black entered as she 
fled screaming after her mother. When the 
two terrified women ventured at length to 
glance into the room from which they had 
been scared, all was quiet; the red glow from 
the fire showed everything to be as they left 
it. What could this be except an apparition 
of the captain with his negro slave, and the 
old gentleman himself in black pursuing 



them true cause of the app.r 

ather more substantial, but scared}

skull of the Ethiop to his codec: 
cordingly the same evening, a frosty one in 
try, he revisited the castle, and, being 
•- rms with the turnkey, 1 
to the room in Hadrian's tower to p 
himself of the coveted specimen. He had 
provided himself with a strong paper bag, 
and into this he placed the .skull, covering 
the whole with his cloak. A- - -was 

outside he began to hasten down the hill, but 
his foot slipped upon the ice c vered pave- 
ment, he fell forward, and the skull j&lt; 
out of the bag, rolled down the declivity, and 
struck the cottage door of the widow and her 
daughter, finding a resting-place for an 
instant upon the floor of the room. &lt; 
dashed desperately after his prize, and, gath- 
ering it into his cloak, ran off and never 
stopped until he reached the surgery. 

Owen matriculated at Edinburgh in 1S24, 
and in the following year came to London 
and became prosector to Doctor Abernethy, 
who in 1826 started him upon his distin- 
guished and honorable career by procuring 
him the appointment of assistant to the Con- 
servator (Mr. Clift) of the Museum of the 
Royal College of Surgeons. The appoint- 
ment was made with a view to Owen under- 
taking the arrangement of the collections 
formed by John Hunter, which had recently 
been placed in the care of the college. In 
subsequent years Owen and Mr. Clift's daugh- 
ter were married. The union must have been 
an almost ideal one. Throughout thes&lt; 
umes respectful love and care for his wife are 
exhibited in all Owen's letters and actions. 
And on her part a loving devotion to. and 
veneration for, her husband are modestly 
manifested. 

From this point Owen's life was one long 
continuous accession of Honors and pleasure, 
The proverbial ups-and-downs never came 
within his experience. He appears to have 
been spared all sorrows, excepting those 
which make the fundamental bass of all the 
music of mortal life. But so far from spoil- 
ing his spirit, from unduly elevating him. the 
honors which were literally showered upon 
him only seem to have increased the thank- 
fulness of a disposition which was not envious 
in the slightest degree. His enjoyment of 
life was intense, and this was a consequence 
of his intense love for his work. It is appar- 
ent that he experienced the satisfaction born

of well earned reward, but there is no evi- 
dence that this feeling ever gave birth to 
arrogance; rather he was humbly grateful 
that his powers were competent to earn his 
rewards. 

He writes in the year 1830: "I made Cu- 
vier's personal acquaintance at the Museum 
of the College of Surgeons, and was specially 
deputed to show and explain to him such 
specimens as he wished to examine. There 
was no special merit in my being thus de- 
puted, the fact being that I was the only 
person available who could speak French, 
and who had at the same time some knowl- 
edge of the specimens. Cuvier kindly invited 
me to visit the Jardin des Plantes in the fol- 
lowing year." To a man of Owen's tastes a 
meeting with the great anatomist must have 
been big with desires for ambitious work in 
the future. The acceptance of Cuvier's in- 
vitation in the succeeding year doubtless 
confirmed the desires as resolutions. 

Owen's friendship with the Reverend Doc- 
tor Buckland seems to have begun when 
Owen was twenty-eight years of age, by his 
sending Doctor Buckland one of the proofs 
of his work on the Pearly Nautilus, together 
with a letter in which he says: "Since the 
decease of the lamented Cuvier, there is no 
one whose opinion of this work I look for 
with more anxiety than your own." The 
friendship between these two leaders of sci- 
entific thought and research became very 
close and cordial. The year 1834 witnessed 
Owen's appointment to the professoriate of 
comparative anatomy at St. Bartholomew's, 
and his election as a Fellow of the Royal 
Society. In 1836 he was appointed Hun- 
terian Professor at the Royal College of Sur- 
geons. This latter appointment was a source 
of peculiar gratification to him, and the 
twenty-four annual lectures which he deliv- 
ered from this chair were the result of his 
best thought and work. Up to 1837 Owen 
had to some extent cultivated a medical 
practice, but, experiencing a pressure of sci- 
entific work, he decided to relinquish it alto- 
gether and devote himself entirely to research. 
He was an indefatigable dissector and his op- 
portunities were many. The animals which 
died at the Zoological Gardens were at his 
disposal, and so rapidly had his fame as an 
anatomist spread that specimens were for- 
warded to him from every quarter of the 
globe. Everything that was new to him was 
subjected to his keen knife and keener ob- 
servation. A note in Mrs. Owen's diary is as 
follows: "The defunct rhinoceros (late of 
Wombwell's menagerie) arrived while R. was 
out. I told the men to take it right to the 
end of the long passage where it now lies. 



As yet I feel indifferent, but when the pie is 

opened ." Six days later she writes: " R. 

still at the rhinoceros." 

The story of Owen's ciever deduction as to 
the presence of the remains of a large terres- 
trial bird as large as an ostrich, in New Zea- 
land, is given in full by his biographer. It 
is an excellent example of the application of 
his powers of observation as well as of his 
method of ratiocination. From a fragment 
of bone only six inches in length he recon- 
structed the skeleton of the Dinornis which 
was afterwards to be found. No wonder the 
Committee of the Zoological Society refused 
to endorse this bold conclusion, and only 
with hesitation consented to publish his paper 
in the "Transactions" with the proviso that 
the responsibility of it rested exclusively with 
the author. The subsequent verification of his 
conclusions was so complete that when a per- 
fect femur arrived, and was placed over the 
drawing of one made by him when he was in 
possession of the small fragment only, they 
coincided perfectly. 

The round of scientific work, followed with 
such zest, was, nevertheless, not allowed to 
become the round of life. Science never 
caused him to degenerate, as it has caused 
so many others, into a bore. If Carlyle, 
whose keenness of scent for every species of 
cant was so pronounced, could speak of him 
as a man who "was neither a fool nor a hum- 
bug," there is every reason to believe that 
the negative praise was thoroughly deserved. 
Owen was a confirmed but discriminating 
novel-reader; a proficient chess-player; a cul- 
tured musician, being a good executant upon 
the 'cello, and a frequenter of the playhouse. 
Being thus a man of taste, and having secured 
an early introduction into the best society of 
London, he was in constant requisition at all 
the society functions of his day. 

A considerable share of work in connection 
with the organization of the Great Exhibition 
of 185 1 fell to his lot. He was also a Juror 
of the Universal Exhibition of Paris in 1855. 
For his services in connection with this he 
was created a Knight of the Legion of Honor. 

In 1856 Owen was appointed to the new 
office of Superintendent of the Natural His- 
tory Department of the British Museum. This 
was done at the suggestion of Lord Macau- 
lay, whose attention had been drawn to the 
possibility of this department being neglected 
unless placed under the control of a man of 
science. Macaulay was also actuated by a 
desire to make suitable provision for Owen, 
who, he wrote, "is an honor to our country. 
. A poet, a novelist, an historian, a 
painter, a sculptor, who stood in his own line 
as high as Owen stands among men of science,

Wisely, we think, has his biographer de- 
hapter to the account of Owen's 
r a natural history museum which 
should be oi adequate proportions and of 
suitable arrangement for such a displi 
rge collections of specimens which 
stored away in Hloomsbury as should be at 
once interesting to the ordinary visitor, edu- 
cational for the student, and easy of access 
to the scientific worker. After twenty- five 
years' advocacy of his scheme, and of fluctu- 
ating hopes and fears, begotten of our sy 
of party politics, ( hven was permitted to real- 
ize in large measure his desires in the form of 
the present Natural History Museum at South 
Kensington. A fitting memorial of a devoted 
scientist ! 

When the Prince and Princess of Wales 
visited Egypt in 1S69 Owen was asked to join 
the party. The extracts taken from the let- 
ters he wrote upon this occasion consist 
largely of gossipy items of a very pleasing 
character. One of these tells how M. de 
Lesseps endeavored to play a trick upon him. 
Describing his visit to the Suez Canal, he 
writes: "The steamer had taken us to sea so 
that we might view the piers of huge artificial 
blocks of stone intended to keep open the 
entry of the harbor. We then returned to 
inspect the artificial stonework. M. de Les- 
seps, with an innocent air, brought me a piece 
of stone with some shells embedded in it, and 
asked me what formation it belonged to. I 
said it was the most recent I had seen, and 
from the fossils evidently new to geology; 
on the whole, I should describe it as la for- 
mation Lcssepsienne, — which pleased the old 
gentleman amazingly.'' 

With the year 1883 Owen ended his official 
connection with the Natural History Museum, 
and retired to his home, Sheen Lodge, with 
its beautiful garden, to spend his declining 
years in peaceful enjoyment of such simple 
pleasures as are compatible with the burden 
of fourscore years. It was meet that nine 
quiet years should round off to completeness 
the otherwise arduous life of this truly great 
scientist. 

Some notion of the magnitude of his labors 
may be gathered from the forty nine pages 
chronicling the six hundred and thirty-eight 
articles contributed by him to general and 
scientific literature. Four pages are occupied 
with a list of the various distinctions con- 
ferred upon him.

There are four stages of anaesthesia: Stage

caused by the ether. Ether pneumonia may 
be due to the effect of the intense cold upon 
the lungs produced by the ether-vapor, and

traction of the pulmonary capillaries, and 
consequent loss of vis a tergo and darmning-

ON CHOLELITHIASIS. 

BY JOHN A. OUCHTERLONY, A.M., M.D. 

This name, derived from the Greek (XoA??, 
ile, and XiOos, a stone), is used to designate 
hat state of the system in which biliary calculi 
re formed. This disease, without being one 
f the most frequent, is yet far from rare. A 
ood deal of practical knowledge concerning 

has already been accumulated, yet we must 
dmit much remains to be acquired, and 
luch is still shrouded in obscurity. 

This paper is based upon the study of 

lirty-five casjs, and is offered as embody- 

| lg the results of study and clinical experi- 

nce with a disease which for years has been 

f deep interest to me. 

It has been suggested by several distin- 
uished observers that the formation of gall- 
:ones depends upon a peculiar diathesis; and 
1 support of this view they allege that in many 
f these patients there is an evident predis- 
osition manifested by a constant formation 
f gall-stones, and this in spite of all treat- 
lent; that the disease is often hereditary; 
lat there is a certain close connection be- 
veen the state of the system that induces 
le formation of gall-stones and that which 
isults in the formation of urinary calculi; 
nd, finally, that this constitutional state is 
out. I have not been able to corroborate 
lis view; on the contrary, I have been com- 
piled to regard this disease as due to local 
r general causes entirely independent of 
ny diathesis whatever. 

Some cases are rebellious and obstinately 
isist all efforts; but when one reflects how 
ifficult it is to continuously and completely 
Dntrol these patients, and when the various 
matures of the disease are taken into account, 
lis rebelliousness to treatment is more 
;adily explained by the persistence of local 



causes without assuming the existence of a 
peculiar constitutional vice. 

In only two of my cases were any of their 
ancestry known to have had gall-stones, and 
I therefore conclude that heredity plays but 
a feeble part in their production. Morgagni 
thought that hepatic colic, in a patient subject to 
urinary calculi, gave strong reason for suspect- 
ing the existence of biliary calculi, especially if 
the patient were an adult. Subsequent writers 
have noted the coexistence of these two forms 
of lithiasis, and have expressed a belief in their 
mutual connection. I am led to believe it is 
quite rare and incidental, for it was not ob- 
served in a single one of my thirty-five cases. 
Neither did I ever find any of the usual mani- 
festations of gout in the persons I have treated 
for gall-stone. Gout is notoriously uncommon 
in women, but it is especially in this sex that 
gall-stones are most often found. 

The aetiology of gall-stones is one of the 
" dark points" upon which much additional 
light must be shed before our knowledge 
concerning them can be satisfactory and 
complete. Age is one of the general con- 
ditions operating at least as a predisposing 
cause. Gall-stones are most common after 
middle age — my oldest case was a woman 
seventy-six years old; my youngest another 
woman aged twenty-two. They have, how- 
ever, been found in children ten and two 
years old, and even in new-born infants. 
These very young subjects did not, so far as 
I can learn, suffer from hepatic colic, and the 
presence of the concretion was only recog- 
nized after death. I do not know what is 
the earliest recorded age at which they have 
begun their travels and thereby occasioned 
trouble. The greater susceptibility of women 
than men to this disease is well known. It 
is said to be in the proportion of three of the 
former to two of the latter. In my cases the 
difference was even more marked, being 
twenty-nine women to six men. 






THE MEDICAL AGE. 



The m ijority ol tufferinj from 

chole-litl. - enter 

prominently into their dietary; JaCCOtld in- 
sists that they are generally corpulent, and a 
tendency to obesity was noticed by me in 
thirty out of thirty-five. A sedentary life 
pred&gt; i chole-lithiasis by obstructing 

that | &gt;;' tissue metamorphosis whose 

rapidity and perfection is so essential to 
health; it also promotes deposition of biliary 
constituents in the gall-bladder, which is 
strongly favored by too prolonged intervals be- 
meals , and indeed by any retardation of 
the tlow of the bile. Diet undoubtedly has a 
certain influence in the production of gall- 
stones, both in man and in some of the lower 
animals. Precipitation of the solid constitu- 
ents of the bile may be determined by a va- 
riety of local conditions, which I will mention 
in detail. The general conditions just set 
forth act at most as a predisposing cause, 
which, without the action of a local cause, 
would be wholly inoperative so far as the de- 
velopment of gall-stones is concerned. 

It has been observed that biliary calculi 
are more frequent in the gall-bladder of stall- 
fed oxen, and sheep that have been fed on 
dry hay, than in those that have been at pas- 
ture. I have inquired as to the occurrence of 
gallstones in horses, with the hope of throw- 
ing additional light on the general aetiology 
of this disease, but have been surprised to 
learn that among equines it is so rare that 
only one case has been recorded. Percival* 
believes this immunity is due to the simplicity 
of the biliary apparatus in these animals. 

Increase in the solids of the bile to such 
amount that the physiological solvent can no 
longer hold them in solution, the excess being 
thrown down and forming biliary calculi, is 
first among local causes. This mode of form- 
ation is beyond the reach of demonstration, 
but one can readily conceive it to be possible, 
and certain facts render it quite probable: 
gall-stones become frequent at the age when 
the bile contains a larger amount of choles- 
terin, and Chevreul has shown that in several 
persons with chole-lithiasis the bile was ex- 
cessively charged with fats.f

Horse. London, i

A diminuti &gt;n in the amount of biliary sol- 
vents, cholate and choleate of soda and 

a precipitation of soliiS 
mally held in solution, is also 
This mode of formation is still less ca] 
of demonstration than the former, but is ren- 
dered probable by the effects observ&lt; 
administration of biliary salts in certain 
of chole-lithia 

Next must be regarded as a prominent 
r the presence of foreign substar. 
the gall-bladder. Doctor Thudicum* notei 
that in some cases the nuclear part is com- 
posed of casts of the bile-ducts, and the cen- 
tral part often consists of small concretion! 
of bile-pigment which have fallen from the 
smaller ducts. A clot of blood, a globule of 
mercury, a fruit-stone, have been found as 
nuclei of gall-stones. In one case the nucleus 
was composed of a lumbricoid worm, in an- 
other it was a pin. This is doubtless a raw 
mode of formation, but it does occur, which 
shows that when once a nucleus exists biliary 
matters tend to become deposited around it 

Catarrhal inflammation of the biliary pas- 
sages is probably the most efficient and most 
frequent cause of gall-stones. In health ali 
the constituents of the bile are held in solu- 
tion, probably by the cholate of soda. But 
when catarrhal inflammation of the mucoiq 
membrane of the gall-bladder sets in, its sol- 
vent power is lost, the bile is decomposed 
and its solids are thrown down either in the 
form of a pulverulent mass or larger particles 
which tend to increase by continued accre ; 
tion.t 

Doctors Thudicum and Gomp. Bezane 
have shown that when bile is allowed 
stand for a long time in a bottle, acid decom 
position takes place spontaneously, and pig 
ment previously dissolved is deposited. Tha: 
the influence of catarrhal mucus in the gall 
bladder plays an important part in the decom 
position and precipitation of bile, and the 
subsequent formation of calculi, is renderec 
still more probable by analogous changes ii 
the urinary bladder owing to cystitis, so fa 
miliar to all that more extended mention i 
superfluous. 

Another suggestion made by Thudicum 



*Thudicum on Gall-stones, page 166. 

f Jaccoud, loc. ii/. 



THE MEDICAL AGE.

that decomposition of bile may also be due to 
a putrid ferment absorbed by the intestine; 
DUt of this I have seen no proof, nor of its 
igency in the production of gall-stones. Ca- 
;arrh affecting the biliary passages within the 
iver may, though rarely, produce a similar 
result as when affecting the gall-bladder. 

The usual seat of gall-stones is in the gall- 
bladder. They are less commonly found in 
he cystic, hepatic, or common bile-duct, and 
t is only seldom that they are found occupy- 
ng the biliary canals within the liver. In 
his latter locality they are invariably quite 
.mail. Their volume varies from the small 
size of sandy particles to that of a hen's egg, 
!ind even larger,* and is in inverse ratio to 
heir number. 

When there is only a single calculus pres- 
ent, it may fill the whole gall-bladder, and 
isually corresponds in outline to the form of 
the latter. The surface of the concretion 
aay be rough or smooth, but the walls of its 
eceptacle generally fit it closely, sometimes 
ending down processes of mucous membrane 
ito the depressions which here and there fur- 
ow its surface. Multiple calculi, by recipro- 
al attrition and pressure, assume facet 
hapes and convex and concave surfaces, and 
[pus come to fit perfectly together. Some- 
:imes they present the form of regular tetra- 
*'r octa-hedral crystals. In consistence they 
pay be firm or waxy, but are most often 
Irittle, break readily between the fingers, 
; nd soon crumble either spontaneously or on 
light pressure; I have, however, in my col- 
jction, gall-stones passed twelve and thirteen 
ears ago which are still perfectly hard and 
fitact. The material holding the particles 
3gether is thought to be cholic or choloidic 
licid, or both; it has also been supposed to be 
luicus. 

The color is subject to infinite variation; 
ley may be whitish, brownish yellow, brown, 
^een, blackish, mottled, or streaked. They 
re made up of many strata of different ma- 
srials, and the differences in color between 
pese various layers are often very great. 

The calculi have a nucleus, sometimes 

mltiple, chiefly composed of biliary pigment 

? i combination with lime, traces of mucus, 



and earthy phosphates. Around this nucleus 
the materials that constitute the concretion 
become deposited in regular or uneven strata. 
A majority of the calculi are composed en- 
tirely of cholesterin, with a nucleus of calca- 
reous matter or pigment. Now and then 
this pigment is more abundant, and is some- 
times uniformly distributed throughout the 
mass; at other times it and cholesterin form 
alternating layers. In some cases there is 
no cholesterin at all, and the calculi consist 
exclusively of carbonate and phosphate of 
lime. 

Uric acid* has been found in them, and 
they generally contain traces of iron, manga- 
nese, and copper. 

The specific gravity is light, and varies 
with the composition; when chiefly of choles- 
terin they float in water. Ordinarily they are 
slightly heavier than this liquid, and sink 
in it. 

There may be fullness of the gall-bladder, 
and when palpation is practiced the calculi 
are felt as hard, movable bodies, producing 
by contact with each other a crackling sound, 
which may be heard with the stethoscope, 
and is said to resemble the noise made by 
tapping upon a bag containing nuts or dry 
beans. f A large calculus can be accurately 
made out, as shown by Buckler and others. 

Biliary calculi being once formed may re- 
main quiescent within the gall-bladder for 
an indefinite length of time. 

I have never seen a case where the diagno- 
sis could be made under such circumstances, 
though it is sometimes practicable. \ In 
certain cases, however, they do not remain 
latent, but give rise to disturbances of differ- 
ent kinds. 

Ordinarily calculi exist even in large num- 
bers without giving rise to changes in the 
mucous membrane; at other times they are 
merely the lesions peculiar to a catarrhal 
inflammation. \ In a smaller proportion of 
cases their presence induces suppurative in- 
flammation, which may terminate in perfora- 
tion, sometimes into the peritoneum, the 
stomach, the bowel, portal vein, ureter, or 
into the pleura; but fortunately it is usu-

ally preceded by the formation of adhesions 
to neighboring organs, and this is especially 
likely irhere the opening ta 
nally. Such a case came under my ob.M 
tion many years ago through the kindness of 
the late Poet 9 Rogers, who w. 

justly distinguished in life and so deeply 
mourned in death. The patient, a woman of 
middle age, had for a long time suffered from 
dull, recurrent pains in the region of the gall- 
bladder. After a while she had sharp, shoot- 
ing, and then throbbing pains and fever. A 
swelling appeared, and an abscess formed, 
which broke externally, and several gall- 
stones were discharged through the wound. 
In time the opening closed and the patient 
recovered. 

Chronic inflammation may also be de- 
veloped, when the walls of the gall-bladder 
thicken and contract, the liquid contents 
become condensed by absorption of the 
water, and the gall-stones become welded 
together by a chalky mass lying in immediate 
contact with the contracted gall-bladder. 

I have often found biliary calculi at the 
post-mortem examinations of persons in 
whom their presence had never been sus- 
pected during life, and many persons pass 
small gall-stones without any pain, especially 
at Carlsbad and Marienbad while drinking of 
these justly celebrated mineral waters; yet 
ordinarily when the gall stones are disturbed 
and travel along the ducts they give rise in 
their migrations to the symptoms of hepatic 
or gall-stone colic. 

Calculi within the liver itself are even more 
likely to remain latent than when they quietly 
occupy the gall-bladder, but their symptoms 
are so extremely obscure that a diagnosis 
can scarcely be based upon them. Ill-defined 
paroxysmal pains, not radiating, but confined 
to the right hypochondriac region, absence 
of jaundice and hepatic enlargements, with 
perhaps slight digestive derangements, con- 
stitute their whole number. When an intra- 
hepatic calculus in its downward course be- 
comes lodged in the hepatic duct, there is 
fixed pain, persistent jaundice, with whitish 
evacuations, and the liver becomes speedily 
enlarged, but the gall-bladder is not distended 
— and this is a symptom of diagnostic impor- 
tance in differentiating between obstruction 
of the common duct and of the hepatic duct. 



It has already been mentioned that 
culi may remain for a long time in the 
bladder without giving rise to irri* 
in certain cases their presence induces 
cystitis, sometimes so slight and superficial as 
to be unattended by any symptoms, at other 
times involving the whole thickness of the 
wall of the gall-bladder and signalized by 
acute symptoms of great severity; then 
then severe pains in the region of the 
bladder, constant, but with paroxysmal ex- 
acerbations during which they radiate to the 
epigastrium, loins, and right shoulder, and 
also fever. The neck of the gall-bladder is 
of necessity implicated in the inflammatory 
process, and becomes obstructed, hence to 
the symptoms above related is added disten- 
tion of the gall-bladder, which gives rise to a 
pyriform tumor in this region; but there is 
no jaundice, which is a point of importance 
as establishing the diagnosis between this 
condition and obstruction of the common 
duct. 

Chole-cystitis ordinarily terminates in re- 
covery, but may result in perforation and 
peritonitis, as already mentioned, with the 
alarming and grave symptoms that accom- 
pany that event. An interesting case of 
chole-cystitis from gall-stones is reported by 
M. Paulet in Allgemeine Wiener Medicinischi 
Zeitung, 1875, as follows: 

A woman, aged 42, mother of eight chil 
dren, began in November iS74to feel a s 
pain in the right side. On examination then 
was found a somewhat diffuse tumor about 
the size of a child's head, which extend 
from the umbilicus to the anterior superior 
spinous process of the ilium. As the case 
was attended by fever it was diagnosed as one 
of suppurative ovaritis. In December it wa 
determined to open the tumor with Vienn 
paste. In three days the skin was destroyed,' 
and in seven the aponeurosis. An explora- 
tory incision was now made, from which 
little fluid escaped, but the needle came 
contact with numerous hard bodies, whl 
on removal proved to be gall-stones. Fo 
of these were then taken out and a large on&lt; 
found almost encapsulated. It was broke: 
divided, and extracted without much diffi 
culty, and some bile was also discharge

It is difficult to understand why in som 
persons gall-stones, even in large number

should remain in the gall-bladder without 
indicating their presence by any symptoms, 
and why in other cases they should be so 
often disturbed from their resting-place and 
urged along the various passages until finally 
ejected from the system. Speculation on 
this point is vain. There seems to be some 
connection between the inception of an at- 
tack of biliary colic and the period of great- 
est functional activity of the small intestine 
land neighboring parts consequent upon a 
full meal. The paroxysm ordinarily begins 
two or three hours after a meal, and patients 
are prone to believe that food has disagreed. 

When active duodenal contraction on the 
arrival of the chyme stimulates the gall- 
bladder to pour forth its contents, the bile 
thus set in motion engages the calculus in 
the neck of the gall-bladder. When once en- 
tered into the cystic duct, muscular contrac- 
tions, aided by the vis a tergo of the bile, 
propel the calculus until it has cleared the 
;ductus choledochus and drops into the bowel. 
It has already been remarked that biliary 
sand and concretions of larger size may pass 
.without unpleasant symptoms, and even 
/without the knowledge of the patient, but 
such is not the general rule. 

I have noted the symptoms of at least two 
hundred attacks of gall-stone colic, and 
ithough they were subject to great variation 
as to severity and duration they were also 
'characterized by great uniformity so far as 
their number and character were concerned. 
The earliest symptom is usually either shiver- 
ing or a sense of discomfort and distress in 
the epigastrium, and this is soon followed by 
nausea, vomiting, and lastly pain. 
• The nausea recurs in paroxysms, though it 
may be unremitting. The matters vomited 
consist at first of more or less completely 
(digested food, but, continuing after the 
stomach has been completely emptied, they 
j*hen consist of bilious, green-looking liquid. 
When the calculus has reached the common 
duct the vomiting of this greenish liquid 
ceases, though the nausea and retching may 
not have stopped. Bilious vomiting, as sug- 
gested by Trousseau, indicates that the com- 
fmon duct is free, and that the calculus is 
either at the neck of the gall-bladder or in 
the cystic duct. 

The pain is, in most cases, at the com- 



mencement of the paroxysm referred to the 
pit of the stomach, and not to the liver. Sub- 
sequently it may radiate to the navel or the 
right shoulder, and become located more dis- 
tinctly about the lower edge of the liver. 
The pain varies in character. It is described 
by patients as burning, cutting, tearing, or 
boring, or as a sense of painful constriction. 
It may be light, but is more frequently severe, 
and in a well marked paroxysm it is excruci- 
ating, with remissions and violent exacerba- 
tions, which are said sometimes to occur in a 
regular rhythm.* 

Among all painful diseases I have ob- 
served, there is none which entails more in- 
tense suffering than this, and women have 
repeatedly told me that they have endured 
far greater agony in passing a gall-stone 
than in giving birth to a child. Some of my 
patients would in vain seek relief by frequent 
change of posture; others would remain per- 
fectly quiet on their back, finding that every 
motion aggravated their sufferings. 

Sudden and abrupt cessation of the pain, 
according to my observation, most frequently 
indicates that the calculus has tumbled back 
into the gall-bladder after having engaged in 
the neck. Ordinarily, and especially when 
the calculus is large and angular, the mucous 
membrane of the ducts has been bruised and 
lacerated during its downward passage, and 
though there is a sudden abatement of the 
pain when the stone drops into the bowel, yet 
perfect relief is not attained for some time, 
and tenderness and soreness continue per- 
haps for several days. The abdomen is often 
retracted, and its muscles may sometimes be 
seen to contract spasmodically. 

Jaccoud suggests that the abdominal mus- 
cles keep rhythm with the contractions of 
the gall-bladder, endeavoring to expel the 
calculus. The face is often pale, and the 
forehead covered with perspiration; the pu- 
pils are dilated; the pulse is often slow, but 
in many cases, and especially when the par- 
oxysm is severe and has been protracted, it 
becomes small, quick, and irregular. 

The urine is often voided frequently and in 
large quantities, and is very pale and of low 
specific gravity during the paroxysm, but 
after it is over becomes scanty, hfgh-colored,

specific gravity. 

In ordinary hepatic colic there is no frn.

denly passed away with the cause. Krerichs 
reports similar which the temperature 

S 104 , but the duration of the 
fever and that of the paroxysm were exactly 
same. 

When the paroxysm has lasted for some 
time, distention of the gall-bladder may be- 
quite perceptible. In my cases this 
1 rare that I find it recorded only in a 
case of protracted colic, lasting forty-eight 
hours, and in another case where the calculus 
became impacted in the common bile-duct 
and which terminated in death. 

Doctor Hayden* also remarks that the 
round, smooth, yielding tumor mentioned by 
authors as formed by the distended gall- 
bladder is very rarely met with. In some, 
when tumefaction of the gall-bladder was 
present, there was also enlargement of the 
liver; both pass away together as the ob- 
struction is relieved, unless extensive inflam- 
matory action has been excited. 

In twenty out of my thirty-five cases jaun- 
dice was never present, and among the fif- 
teen cases in which it was observed it was 
not an invariable concomitant of the colic 
fits, these patients having many paroxysms 
from which this symptom was absent. From 
this it appears that jaundice is not an invari- 
able or necessary part of biliary colic. A 
calculus descending the cystic duct will not 
induce it; and even when the common bile- 
duct is obstructed, jaundice sets in only if 
the impaction be protracted or the obstruc- 
tion complete; if the latter, the jaundice is 
permanent. Such was the case with one of 
my patients, who died profoundly jaundiced 
and comatose. 

Most frequently the jaundice develops 
during the twenty-four hours immediately 
after the cessation of a paroxysm, and is then 
most likely due to tumefaction of the ducts 
from engorgement caused by the bruising 
and laceration of the mucous membrane dur- 
ing the descent of the stone.

,!eve* has remarked that in 
some instances there are convulsive : 
nunts of the abdomen. This I did not 

ises, nor general convul- 
sions or delirium, which are said sometimes 
to occur in this connection. 

The duration of an attack of biliar 
- from a few hours to many day! 
have had patients in whom it lasted I 
eight hours, and Trousseau records one case 
in which it lasted six months. It appe.. 
be determined by the size and number of 
calculi passing. 

The subsidence of the pain which marks 
the close of the seizure is often sudden, but 
in my experience generally not complete.. 
The patient complains of soreness and weak- 
ness; there is tenderness over the liver and 
gall-bladder, and these in proportion to the 
duration and severity of the attacks. When 
the attack has been protracted, and when 
one follows another in rapid succession, I 
have often noticed steady and marked loss 
in weight. 

One attack of gall-stone colic is, as a rule, 
the precursor of others. The frequency of 
their occurrence appears to depend, among 
other causes, upon the number of gall-stones 
contained in the gall-bladder, and upon the 
rapidity with which new ones are formed. In 
some cases weeks, months, and even years 
may mark the intervals between the attacks. 
In other cases these occur within a few days, 
or even a few hours. 

In the latter class there are multiple cal- 
culi which migrate in rapid succession, or a 
single calculus repeatedly engages in the 
funnel-shaped orifice of the cystic duct, and 
then falls back into the gall-bladder; or it 
traverses the narrow cystic duct, and on 
entering the common duct, which is of 
larger calibre, the pain greatly abates, and 
finally it engages the narrow orifice of the 
latter, when the pain again returns with in- 
creased violence, until the calculus at last 
clears it and drops into the bowel, and "the 
fit is at an end. I have on several occasions 
been led to the opinion that a calculus having 
engaged in the orifice of the cystic duct had 
receded and fallen back into the gall-bladder. 

The following points have guided me in 



Reynold's System of Medicine, vol. iii, page 315. 



THE MEDICAL AGE.

these cases: The short duration of the seiz- 
ure: The sudden cessation of pain: Entire 
absence of jaundice during and after the 
paroxysm: Failure to find a calculus in the 
evacuations, though careful search was con- 
tinued for two or three days after the fit had 
ceased. 

But in many cases no such minute diagno- 
sis is possible. Indeed the diagnosis of gall- 
stone colic is often obscure, and the true 
nature of the disease is not seldom over- 
looked. An illustrative case occurred not 
long ago in a Western city, the particulars of 
which were communicated to me by a medi- 
cal friend, who performed the post-mortem 
examination. The gall-bladder was filled 
with biliary calculi; the common duct was 
obstructed by a large concretion which had 
become impacted at its orifice, causing not 
only inflammation, but obstruction of the 
duodenum. 

Gall-stone colic may be distinguished from 
ordinary colic by the latter never being asso- 
ciated with jaundice; by the relief afforded 
by emetics and purgatives; by the pain being 
located farther down; and by the absence of 
tenderness and soreness over the liver and 
gall-bladder. 

Renal colic is accompanied with irritation 
of the urinary organs, the coarse or micro- 
scopic appearance of blood in the urine, 
the course of the pain, retraction of the tes- 
ticle, passage of gravel per urethram, etc. 

In hepatic neuralgia the pain is far less 
severe. There is apt to be neuralgia in other 
parts with which it alternates; there is ab- 
sence of jaundice, no enlargement of the 
gall-bladder and liver, and no gall-stones are 
passed. Hepatic neuralgia, besides, is ex- 
ceedingly rare, and occurs mostly in hyster- 
ical women. 

Cancer of the pylorus has been mistaken 
for hepatic colic. I have differentiated them 
by noting that in the former the pain is more 
constant, though less severe; there is no 
jaundice, the liver and gall-bladder are not 
enlarged, and the tumor, when pressed, is 
seated higher in the abdomen and nearer the 
median line than the gall-bladder. 

In carcinoma of the liver I have seen jaun- 
i dice and enlargement of the gall-bladder from 
pressure of a cancerous nodule on the ducts, 
but the steadiness of the pain, the nodulated 



enlargement of the liver, the cachexia, and 
absence of the paroxysmal elements render 
the diagnosis easy. 

Aneurysm of the abdominal aorta and 
hepatic artery have been associated with 
paroxysms of excruciating pain, and jaun- 
dice, and even enlargement of the gall- 
bladder, and in some instances these lesions 
have been mistaken for gall-stone colic; but 
aneurysm in this locality is usually recog- 
nized without difficulty by attention to its 
characteristic signs. 

The only positive sign of gall-stone colic is 
the finding of the calculus, or fragments of 
it, or biliary sand, in the evacuations. Care- 
ful search for them should, therefore, always 
be made when their presence is suspected. 
Every evacuation for several days after the 
seizure should be kept for investigation. 

I generally prescribe a dose of some pur- 
gative the day after an attack of biliary 
colic, most often castor oil, which is indi- 
cated on account of the constipation that 
then commonly exists; and it has besides 
the effect of hastening the ejection of any 
calculi that may have found their way into 
the bowel. The method of search is a mat- 
ter of some importance. A double thickness 
of fine mosquito-netting is tied over the top 
of a slop-bucket, and the faeces softened and 
diluted by the addition of warm water should 
then be poured upon the netting. All solids, 
such as pieces of bone, undigested vegetable 
matter, or gall-stones, are detained, while all 
the soluble portions filter through. When 
sought for in this manner, even small calculi 
cannot escape detection. It is rather tedious 
and unpleasant work, but it should never be 
neglected, and rarely entrusted to others. In 
one case my diagnosis was hotly contested, 
and its correctness admitted only when, after 
two days' search, a rather lasge calculus was 
found. 

If the calculus is large, round, or oval, with 
uneven surface and single, it is probable that 
no others remain behind. If, on the con- 
trary, it or they be facet-shaped and polished, 
the gall-bladder will probably contain more 
that have not yet passed. The latter is the 
most common, and among the numerous 
biliary calculi that I have found, only one had 
the appearance of being solitary. 

The complications and sequelae are some-

already incidentally made. In my own 
unfavorable developments were very rare, 
and my knowledge Of them is derived in part 
fmm dead-house experience in the hospitals 
to which I have been attached, and in part 
from acquaintance with writers on the 

The calculi, whether in the liver, gall- 
bladder, or ducts, may give rise to inflamma- 
tion, suppuration, and the establishment of 
internal or external fistula — the former are 
beyond our reach, but the latter have re- 
peatedly terminated in perfect recovery, as 
shown by cases quoted in these pages. 

Rupture of the ducts or of the gall-bladder, 
and general and fatal peritonitis, happen oc- 
casionally. The literature of chole-lithiasis 
furnishes a number of instances, but it must 
be of rare occurrence. 

A calculus may become permanently im- 
pacted in the ductus choledochus, or this 
duct may become obliterated from inflamma- 
tion excited by the passage of a gall-stone. 
Under such circumstances there is enlarge- 
ment of the gall-bladder, tumefaction of the 
liver, with enormous dilatation of the biliary 
ducts, which may form fluctuating tumors 
like abscesses. There is persistent jaundice, 
but sometimes the faeces retain their normal 
color and the jaundice abates because, under 
increasing pressure from behind, the bile 
filters through between the wall of the duct 
and the impacted concretion. 

Gangrene of the duct, followed by sudden 
death, has occurred (Bretonneau). 

Even when the calculus has passed into 
the intestine, all danger is not over. If large 
it may cause fatal obstruction of the bowel. 
Such cases have been related by Murchison,* 
by Cohnheim,f r3y Jeaffreson.J In other cases 
the calculus has been extracted from the rec- 
tum during life; such a one was reported by 
Doctor Mitchell. || If the calculi be small, 
they may become arrested in the vermiform 
appendix and cause perforation and fatal 
peritonitis.^

In the majority of cases prognosis is favor- 
able, but the possible occurrence of such 
grave complications as those just enumerated 
must not be overlooked. Twenty-two out of 
thirty-five cases have passed from under my 
observation, but previously appeared to be 
permanently relieved; eleven still remain un- 
der observation, and in all of these a number 
of years have elapsed since the last seizure. 
Two died, as already stated. The length of 
time required to effect a cure is impossible to 
foretell; it depends in great measure upon* 
the intelligent and hearty cooperation of the 
patient. The disease runs no definite course, 
but may extend over several years. 

The therapeutic indications are two-fold, 
viz. : To relieve the patient during the attack, 
and: To prevent its recurrence. To accom- 
plish these objects is not always easy, and, as 
in almost every exigency, there is ample scope 
for the exercise of sound judgment and nice 
discrimination in the selection of means and 
methods appropriate to the particular case in 
hand. 

The agent that in my hands has been most 
uniformly efficacious for the relief of pain and 
prevention of shock to the nervous system, is 
morphia. I have also thought that it tends 
to shorten the paroxysm, as well as to lessen 
its severity. It should be administered hypo- 
dermatically. I usually give from one-fourth 
to one half grain, repeating this every hour 
or two until the pain is relieved. The earlier 
in the seizure it is resorted to, the more cer- 
tain it is to afford speedy relief.

In a recent article on this subject, Doctor 
Hayden, of Dublin,* confirms, by his results, 
the opinion I have expressed about this rem- 
edy, and declares that hypodermatic injec- 
tions of morphine are more efficacious than 
the inhalations of chloroform. 

Opiates should never be given by the mouth 
or in solid form for the relief of gall-stone 
colic. 

In some cases I have treated, the pains were 
so atrocious that morphia was inadequate to 
allay them; the administration of chloroform 
is then the best alternative. It may be given 
simply for the relief of pain and to induce 
such relaxation of the tissues as to thereby 
facilitate the passage of the gall-stone, and 
then the best method of using it is by inhala- 
tion. But the paroxysm may be so protracted 
as to make the continued inhalation of chlo- 
roform not only inconvenient but absolutely 
unsafe, and I have more than once been 
compelled to discontinue its use on such 
account. 

Chloroform is also given internally with 
the view of causing the rapid solution of the 
gall-stones in situ. Its administration in this 
way is based on the fact that chloroform is a 
powerful solvent of cholesterin calculi out of 
the body, and upon the supposition that it is 
not changed in the blood and passes from 
this fluid into the gall-bladder, where its sol- 
vent action is exerted upon the contained 
calculi. One is inclined to reject at once 
this theory of its action as highly improbable; 
for it is indeed difficult to believe that a quan- 
tity of chloroform sufficient to dissolve these 
calculi in situ can be safely administered to a 
patient, even if the passage of the volatile 
liquid into the gall-bladder were at all proved. 
Doctor Buckler,! of Baltimore, has adhered 
to this treatment for over twenty years, and 
declares that he has invariably found it 
trustworthy and successful. He gave a tea- 
spoonful of chloroform internally every hour 
while the pain lasted, and a teaspoonful after 
each meal for five days longer, and saw a 
large calculus in the gall-bladder melt away 
under its use, so that at the end of this period 
the tumor had disappeared. Doctor John

Barclay,* Physician to the Infirmary, Leices- 
ter, England, gives the same modus operandi 
and entertains the same high opinion of the 
value of chloroform administered internally 
in this disease, and declares that he has found 
it to give invariable and permanent relief in 
many instances. But his good results were 
obtained with much smaller doses than those 
given and advised by Doctor Buckler; two 
or three drops three or four times a day 
being all he gave. In my experience these 
large and frequent doses of chloroform have 
produced alarming symptoms, and I have 
never been able to give them with the free- 
dom recommended by Doctor Buckler. The 
smaller doses I have found utterly without 
effect. 

The general, prolonged hot bath I have 
sometimes found of signal benefit in pro- 
ducing relaxation and relieving pain, but it 
is often inconvenient, and perhaps as often 
impossible of access. Surrounding the pa- 
tient's waist with a folded sheet wrung out of 
hot water will sometimes give relief; and in 
several instances I found the application of 
leeches speedily effectual when everything 
else had failed. 

Jaccoud states that general blood-letting 
has in several cases been followed by sudden 
cessation of spasm of the ducts and subsi- 
dence of the attack. 

Emetics are often resorted to by the pa- 
tient himself on account of the nausea and 
retching, which induce him to believe that 
if he could only vomit freely, the pain as 
well as the nausea would cease. But emetics 
ought to be rigorously proscribed, for if they 
do favor the progress of the gall-stone by 
provoking more powerful contraction, they 
are also likely to produce rupture of the 
ducts. 

When the paroxysm is over, I believe the 
administration of a purgative, such as castor 
oil, is advisable and hastens the ejection of 
the gall-stone. 

In order to prevent the recurrence of the 
paroxysms, at least two conditions must be 
fulfilled: Any gall-stones remaining in the 
gall-bladder must be dissolved: Formation 
of new concretions must be prevented. 

The well known solvent power of ethers

upon cholesterin was I to be active 

within as well as out of the gall-bladder. 

this principle the treatment for gall- 
stones by means of Duraiulc's remedy was 
based. I . while rejecting the theory, 

pted the remedy, which is COmDOS 
sulphuric ether three drachms, turpentine 
two drachms; dose, two teaspoonfuls in the 
morning, and gradually increased until about 
a pound of the mixture has been taken in all. 
At present this medicine is little used on ac- 
count of its disagreeable taste, which soon 
mes loathsome to the patient; I have 
never prescribed it. 

Success in preventing future paroxysms 
must depend upon our ability to arrest the 
formation of new concretions and to facili- 
tate the expulsion of those already formed. 

So long as gall-stones remain in the gall- 
bladder the liability to future paroxysms of 
colic continues, and this must be clearly ex- 
plained to the patients. When our efforts 
are adequately seconded by the patient, a 
cure can generally be effected so that no new 
gall-stones will be formed. 

The patient's food should be plain but 
nourishing. Highly seasoned viands, malt 
liquors, fats, sweets and rich soups must be 
interdicted. He should eat moderately, at 
short intervals — not less than three meals a 
day. He should take active exercise, by 
walking; all other exercise is inferior to this. 
So long as any calculi remain in the gall- 
bladder he should not indulge in violent ex- 
ertions, such as running, wrestling, etc. His 
daily life must be regulated with the view of 
establishing rapid and perfect tissue change, 
perfect combustion and complete and speedy 
elimination. 

Doctor Buckler, in the paper already men- 
tioned, suggests that any remedy capable of 
preventing the formation of gall-stones must 
be a highly oxygenated compound, and fur- 
ther states that the difficulty of dissolving 
cholesterin by any other substance than ether 
or chloroform grows out of the fact that 
cholesterin contains a very small amount of 
oxygen, from i/j to 2 percent., which is less 
than that of almost any other substance. 
He proposed succinic acid and peroxide of 
iron on account of the large amount of 
oxygen contained in both of them. I have 
used this preparation of succinate of peroxide 



of iron, and in almost with com- 

plete success. It should be taken for six 
months continuously at least.* 

It 1 been my practice to put the 

patients upon a course of Carlsba 
Vichy or Marienbad waters have also been 

with benefit. Artificial mineral w 
of good quality I have often prescribed with 
lent results. It is difficult to Bay how 
they act. At Carlsbad, patients who drink 
the waters often begin without pain t" 
gall-stones, whose existence they had 
suspected. 

As insufficient alkalinity of the bile, and 
the prolonged stay in the gall-bladder of that 
fluid, favor the formation of gall-stones, it is 
possible that these alkaline waters become 
remedial by provoking a more active and 
abundant percolation of highly attenuated 
and hyper-alkaline bile, which will prevent 
the deposition of bile-pigment and the form- 
ation of calculi. 

The action of these waters upon catarrhal 
states of the mucous membranes may also 
have a share in their good effects in this dis- 
ease, which so frequently depends upon 
catarrh of the gall-bladder. Whatever their 
modus operandi may be, their curative value is 
undisputed. 

In my earlier cases I relied upon a remedy 
that was employed with much advantage by 
the late distinguished Doctor Lewis Rogers, 
of this city: 

# Ammonium hydrochlorate, 4 drachms. 

Extract taraxacum, 4 drachms. 

Water, 6 ounces. 
A dessertspoonful three times daily. 

A few years ago Schiff, of Germany, sug- 
gested that gall-stones are formed of choles- 
terin, not because this substance is formed 
in too great abundance, but because the bile 
is deficient in principles which maintain it in 
solution; these are soda and potash salts of 
cholic and choleic acid. Schiff therefore 
recommended that eight grains of choleatc

The dose may then be diminished, but not 
entirely suspended. It should be kept up at 
least a week to produce amelioration of lead- 
ing symptoms. 

Doctor Dabney, of Virginia, has published 
cases fully bearing out the previous dicta of 
Schiff. On one occasion I procured some

BILIOUS REHITTENT FEVER OF THE 
TROPICS. 

BY DOCTOR JOAO VINCENTE TORRES HOMEM.* 

{Continued from page 328.} 

Case 1. — Jose* Carrazedo, Spaniard, 33 years 
of age, bilious-sanguine temperament, em- 
ploye of a bakery, eleven years resident in 
Brazil, entered Mizericordia Hospital May 
7th, 1867. Suffered from intermittent fever 
during two months in 1866; is subject to 
superficial lymphatitis (commonly called 
white erysipelas), and abuses alcoholic stimu- 
lants. Having gone about a good deal on 
the 5 th, taking bread to various customers, 
he returned home indisposed, with wander- 
ing pains in the legs and headache. At 3 
:p.m. dined with but little appetite, and im- 
mediately after went out again to his ordi- 
nary business. At 8 p.m. had a severe chill 
land vomiting, rejecting all the food taken at 
dinner; fever set in, and he was very restless 
Etill next morning. He took a purgative of 
castor oil, which produced four large evacua- 
tions, and abstained entirely from food. The 
fever, which had lessened, increased during 
(•the afternoon and night of the 6th, and next 
day at seven o'clock the patient came to the 
hospital. 

His face was flushed; sub- jaundice of 
sclerotic conjunctiva and entire skin, espe- 
cially neck and thorax; slight headache; no 
delirium; pulse 98 and full; peripheral heat 
a little increased; tongue covered with a 
thick coat of yellow fur; thirst; anorexia; 
nausea and vomiting after swallowing a large 
quantity of water — the vomited matter being 
an inodorous greenish fluid; slight diarrhoea; 
belly tender on palpation, especially in epi- 



gastrium and hypochondria; liver enlarged; 
spleen a little larger than normal; urine very 
high-colored, scanty, and without albumen; 
respiratory organs entirely sound. 

Immediately ordered six wet cups to he- 
patic region; one gramme of calomel in three 
doses, at two hours' interval; an ounce and 
a-quarter of castor oil, to be taken two hours 
after last dose of calomel; one gramme qui- 
nine muriate, to be taken immediately after 
purging, and sixty centigrammes for the next 
morning. 

May 8th. Patient completely jaundiced. 
Bore calomel well, but vomited castor oil 
and the two doses of quinine; had three 
copious bilious stools; whenever he drinks 
water, even in small amount, vomits a few 
moments later. Tongue remains much coated, 
yellow color of fur deeper; temperature of 
skin above normal; some perspiration on 
neck and chest; pulse 96; liver and spleen 
unchanged since yesterday; urine exhibits a 
large amount of bile pigment. No symptom 
as regards the nervous system, with the ex- 
ception of some prostration of strength. 
Prescribed five centigrammes of tartar 
emetic in 250 grammes of infusion of ipecac, 
half a wineglassful every half-hour; orange- 
ade ab libitu??i after operation of emetic; one 
gramme quinine in two doses — one at six 
o'clock, the other at nine the next morning. 

May 9th. Jaundice more pronounced. 
The emetic had acted freely — patient vomited 
eleven times and had six bilious stools; no 
longer any vomiting. The two doses of 
quinine, given in solution with acid lemon- 
ade, were well borne; tongue clearer; tem- 
perature still high; skin covered with some 
sweat on forehead, neck, and trunk; pulse 
96, less full. The night before the patient 
had some shivering, and a few hours after- 
wards felt worse. The interne found him at 
five o'clock with high fever, intense head- 
ache, and great thirst, and ordered orangeade 
continued, and two sinapisms applied to 
calves of legs. Liver in same condition; 
spleen more enlarged; urine very bilious. 
Ordered one gramme more of quinine in two 
doses — one to be taken at noon, the other at 
3 p.m.; decoction of barley and herva tustao* 
with two grammes of nitrate of potash, eight 
grammes of soluble cream of tartar, and 
forty-five grammes of syrup of asparagus- 
tips — a wineglassful every two hours; con- 
tinued the orangeade. 

May 10th. Patient's condition much the 
same. No vomiting, but has had diarrhoea; 
jaundice very intense and generalized; tongue

Syrup orange*] grammes. 

Water. 120 grami!. 

A tablespoonful every hour. 

May 11th. Little fever; patient covered 
with sweat; pulse 86. No chills the night be- 
fore, and the febrile exacerbation was not 
great, though subdelirium appeared before 
morning. Some disturbance of intellect per- 
ceptible, especially on questioning; some 
tremor in the upper limbs. At 7 a.m. slight 
epistaxis, which yielded spontaneously; evac- 
uations lessened, but the belly still a little 
tympanitic; liver and spleen both less en- 
larged; urine very bilious, with a larger 
amount of albumen; deafness and the acous- 
tic disturbance produced by the salts of 
quinine. Ordered the quinine suspended; 
blisters to calves of legs; orangeade contin- 
ued; two mutton broths; also: 

3 Ammonia carbonate, I gramme. 
Sulphuric ether, 2 grammes. 
Tincture hyoscyamus, 2 grammes. 
Diacodium syrup, 30 grammes. 

One tablespoonful every hour. 

The patient continued under this treatment 
till the 14th, when the fever was moderate in 
the afternoon and hardly perceptible in the 
morning. Delirium continued to appear dur- 
ing the night, and afterwards was manifest 
also by day. The dryness of the tongue per- 
sisted; the stools were bilious, and few in 
number; the pulse varied between 82 and 86. 
Ordered two tablespoonf uls of port wine every 
two hours, alternated with mixture; orange- 
ade continued; meat broth; eight grammes 
of asafoetida in 300 grammes of infusion of 
chamomile for two enemas at six hours' inter-

Tincture canella, 4 grammes. 
Tincture musk, 4 grammes.

Under this treatment, regularly followed 
to the night of May 19th, the patient went 



on gradually improving. The delirium, I 
or of upper limbs, and dryness of tongue 
diminished; the adynamia which accompa 
these grave symptoms w.. 

May 20th. Patient's face lively: 
to questions clear and prompt; is aware of 
his improvement; says he has appetite, and 
asks for better diet. Peripheral temperature 
normal; pulse 80 and weak. Tongue l 
and large, barely covered at base with a 
slight coat of yellowish fur; belly soft and 
painless; liver still enlarged, especially at 
lower border; spleen a little larger than 
mal; two bilious stools in twenty- four hours; 
urine very abundant, loaded with bile-pig- 
ment and without albumen; jaundiced color 
of skin and sclerotics remains the same; 
great itching in several parts of body. Or- 
dered port wine continued; a bottle of natural 
Vichy water daily; two rice broths, one boiled 
egg. Suspended all previous treatment. 

May 2 2d, patient had stewed chicken for 
diet. He was gradually given more nutritious 
diet, and was discharged on the 30th, retain- 
ing as the only vestige of his dangerous ill- 
ness the yellow color of the skin proper to 
jaundice. 

In June, 1868, this patient again entered 
the hospital to be treated for an acute bron- 
chitis, and presented no symptom of the 
bilious fever which had attacked him the 
year before. 

Case 2. — Jose Luciano Guimaraes, Portu- 
guese, 28 years old, tailor, four years resident 
in Brazil, entered Mizericordia Hospital 
March 17th, 1870. Had variola in 1866, and 
always since enjoyed perfect health, leading 
a very regular life. After a walk in the 
Botanical Garden, exposed to the sun for 
several hours, and while very sweaty and 
tired, he drank a glass of iced beer. Felt 
nothing during the rest of day or night, but 
on rising the next morning perceived that he 
was not fit for work, had heaviness of head, 
weakness of the limbs, and bitter taste in the 
mouth; he, however, left his house in the 
Rua dos Invalidos, arriving at his shop in 
the Rua do Hospicio very weary and with 
headache. Took no breakfast, and at eleven 
o'clock had some shivering, followed by great 
heat of face. Returned to his room in a car- 
riage at 2 p.m.; took a sudorific drink, which 
did not afford the slightest relief. At night 
had high fever and vomited once. A physi- 
cian who saw him next day prescribed an 
antimonial mixture, under which he improved 
considerably; but later on he again began to 
feel very ill and had a severe chill. Came 
to the hospital at 11 a.m., when the physician

on duty ordered sixty grammes of castor oil, 
and later one gramme of quinine. 

March 18th. Patient presents well marked 
and general jaundice; expression stupid; 
prostration of strength. Had delirium the

112, slightly fuller; tongue covered with yel- 
low fur and dry at tip; no vomiting; liver 
enlarged; spleen normal; urine high-colored,

lirium; teeth covered with sordes; adynamia 
progressing. Examination of matter ejected 
by vomiting reveals a certain amount of

Case 4. — Mrs. D. F , Brazilian, 42 yea 

of age, still very regular, from the country 
but temporarily residing in the city, was a 
tacked on February 3d, 1872, at 8 p.m., b 
typical symptoms of indigestion, which cause 
her no surprise, as, contrary to her habit, she 
had over-indulged in certain articles of food 
at dinner. She passed a restless night, unable 
to sleep, and awoke with fever and very in- 
tense headache. Was given a diaphoretic 
ptisan, which had little effect, and afterwards 
a purgative of castor oil, which produced 
several evacuations. On the 5th, 6th and 
7th she took several doses of quinine in pill 
form, some of the pills being rejected by 
vomiting. On the 8th at 11 a.m. I for the 
first time saw her in consultation, becoming 
afterwards one of the attendants. 

February 8th. Very pronounced jaundice 
in upper part of trunk, neck, and sclerotics, 
elsewhere slight; adynamia; expression con- 
fused and uncertain; delirium with great 
restlessness; moves her head and arms con-

leep sigh or a hiccough; eyes half-closed, 
.nd not the least attention paid to what is 
;oing on in the ward; no response to ques-

August 10th. Epistaxis has entirely ceased; 
hematuria increased. Patient answers ques- 
tions more clearly, but there still is some sub- 
delirium; tongue moist and coated; slight 
sordes on teeth. Two bilious stools. Liver 
enlarged, but less painful; temperature 100. 8° 
(the night before, 101.5 ); pulse 120. Same 
treatment. 

August 1 2th the mixture for use in nasal 
fossae was suspended. On the 13th there 
was no longer any delirium, but the urine 
continued bloody. 

August 14th. More color in face; intelli- 
gence perfect; still great prostration; jaun- 
dice very marked; tongue moist, slightly 
coated; liver still enlarged; spleen normal; 
bowels open; urine very copious, but thick 
and loaded with bile-pigment, though free 
from blood and albumen; temperature 99. 6°; 
pulse 108. Ordered four grammes powdered 
calisaya bark in coffee; two mutton broths, 
with wine, and one soup; AgUa de Inglaterra, 
half a wineglass every two hours. 

This treatment was continued until the 
29th, gradually increasing the diet. On the 
30th the patient, still weak and jaundiced, but 
fully convalescent, and with a good appetite, 
was taken by his brother to Rio Comprido. 

The next case, the importance of which 
consists merely in the variety and gravity of 
the nervous symptoms which appeared four 
days after the jaundice, remains incomplete 
for lack of autopsy. In hospitals it is very 
difficult, if not impossible, to have recourse 
to this source of truth and instruction, if the 
patient is in a private room.

SYPHILIS.* 



BY J. M. HALLY, M.P. 

This is a topic in which all honorable 
members of the profession should evince 
more lively interest than is common at the 
present day. It may be asserted without 
fear of contradiction, that the average prac- 
titioner gives but little time or thought to 
the proper treatment of this malady; though 
why, it is difficult to say. 

It will be of no avail to importune repre- 
sentatives of the law and legislative bodies 
to enact measures that shall prohibit knaves, 
charlatans and other cormorants from en- 
riching themselves by preying upon the gul- 
libility of the public, if the medical profession

lis unable to prove to the masses that, in the 
treatment of diseases wherein quacks claim 
■ to specialize, honest practitioners are at least 
their equals (to say nothing of being their 
superiors). How often glaring advertise- 
ments announce sure relief to cases that 
have "puzzled the doctors." "The doctors 
Idid not know what was the matter with me," 
or, "After spending a little fortune in vain at- 
tempts to get relief from many of the most 
eminent men in the medical profession, 'Gun 
Wa' (or 'Lee Wing' or 'Gee Wo') cured me 
entirely in three or six weeks," are common 
"catches." This would not be so if all or 
even a majority of medical men would be 
true to themselves and to the profession in 
which they have the honor of membership. 
And it is with the hope of stimulating some 
interest in this subject that I offer this brief 
*paper. 

It is superfluous to enter on a detailed or 
lengthy description of the disease, or to dwell 
rupon the active stage of syphilis, the condi- 
tions of the initial lesion, or the pathological 
phenomena connected therewith. It is suf- 
ficient to merely outline the generally ac- 
cepted idea. The writings of such men as 
Taylor, Bumstead, Otis, Diday, Vidal, Ricord 
rand Lee are replete with clear and exhaus- 
tive descriptions and explanations, and he 
iwho follows these will have no trouble in 
understanding and diagnosing the disease. 

All physicians recognize the fact that the 
introduction and multiplication of disease 
germs in the human system is the leading 
feature of that part of the disease aptly 
named the active stage; and there is no ques- 
tion as to how these germs find access to the 
system, the accepted theory, or rather the 
'well established fact, being that it is by in- 
oculation. 

Many are led to believe that if syphilis 
is "once in the system," there is very little 
'if any hope of ever regaining the state of 
bodily and mental health previously pos- 
sessed. It is generally held by those most 
conversant with the malady that, instead of 
the so-called tertiary form being a stage, it is 
merely the sequel of the active form; that 
the much-dreaded virus has ceased to exist, 
and consequently this period is one of non- 
contagion. But a sequel obtaining after 
subsidence of the active period should not be 



regarded as constituting a specific stage, 
since such may be manifest or may not. — 
After scarlatina there may arise a dropsical 
condition, but such can hardly be deemed 
another stage of the malady proper. It 
would be well if all physicians informed them- 
selves carefully regarding the various se- 
quelae, their diagnoses and differentiations, 
so as to be able to treat them when found, or 
assure their trusting and often terror-stricken 
patients that they mean little, if anything. It 
is mainly through the advantage held for,th 
in reference to these often groundless fears 
that' quacks and charlatans prosper. 

So long as the profession is unable to sat- 
isfy the public that it is qualified to grapple 
successfully with this malady in all its forms, 
and under every condition whatever, and 
wherever and whenever encountered, so long 
will quackery abound, and legislation against 
it be nil. Experience has proven that many 
of the so-called sequelae of syphilis might 
rather be regarded as the result of treatment 
than as the consequence of a specific virus;, 
and to regard these symptoms as requiring 
powerful anti-syphilitic remedies in large 
doses — as if some obnoxious intruder were 
to be routed from the system — is, to say the 
least, injudicious. 

The danger, then, is from the reaction 
against the agents employed in these in- 
stances improperly. How often is found in- 
flammation of the throat, nose, mouth, and 
other mucous membranes, as a result of a too 
vigorous treatment with mercurials during 
the active stage ! Mercury is a recognized 
antidote to syphilitic virus, yet it is too fre- 
quently carried to a point beyond any neces- 
sity, often to absolute injury. The nice point 
to determine is, just when the virus has been 
neutralized and when the remedy should be 
given up; and from neglect or inability in 
this direction pathological processes both 
local and constitutional are induced. No 
one will venture to question the beneficial 
effects of iodide of potassium properly em- 
ployed, but a cachectic condition is fre- 
quently induced by this drug owing to dimi- 
nution of fibrin, coupled with excessive waste 
and resultant tissue metamorphosis; many of 
the catarrhal maladies from which syphilitic 
patients suffer are merely the effects of push- 
ing this valuable alterative too far. 






THE MEDICAL AGE. 



If choice were made Of alteratives, the 

verdict could be given, with profit, in 
of those of veg i against mer- 

curials and iodides, in this condition or phase 
of the trouble. Some authors insist that the 

trement of the patient under anti-syph- 
ilitic medication is indicative of the disease 

syphilitic, and therefore anti-syphilitics 
should be pushed; others, again, contend 
that this class of remedies should be used 
sparingly, while the vegetable remedies 
should be substituted, and those that are 
tonic in their character preferred, as the 
metamorphosis should be constructive rather 
than destructive in the majority of instances. 
I have long opposed the use of mercury and 
iodide of potassium in the treatment of pa- 
tients who are suffering from sympathetic 
sequelae or the tertiary stage of syphilis, and 
am satisfied by experience that my disfavor is 
well founded; that, on the other hand, drugs 
of vegetable origin, and the tissue remedies of 
Schiissler, have given both my patients and 
myself ample satisfaction, with regard to 
pleasantness and to rapidity of action. I ven- 
ture to offer the following as corroborative: 

Case i. — Mrs. P , aged 39, married, 

mother of four children, the youngest five 
years old; complained of a hard lump in the 
left breast, also of another in the right 
gluteal region, and a third on the inner 
aspect of the thigh. All were nearly subcu- 
taneous, rising very little above the general 
surface of the surrounding parts; hard, firm, 
and cartilaginous to the touch, and slightly 
painful on deep pressure; the one in the 
breast was the largest and most sensitive. 
Examination of the mouth and throat failed 
to reveal anything abnormal, but question- 
ing elicited enough to warrant the conclusion 
that the case was one of gummatous syphil- 
oderm. She was pale, cachectic, and very 
much alarmed regarding the tumor in her 
breast, being almost convinced it was cancer- 
ous and removable only by the knife. An 
assurance was given that such was not the 
case, and treatment began with fluoride of 
calcium and potassium muriate alternately. 
Phytolacca was also given as a recurrent 
remedy, and vegetable tonics as indicated. 
The patient was dismissed two months later, 
no sign of the tumors remaining. 

Case 2. — R. H , dry-goods clerk, aged 

27 ; blonde, slightly built, pale and sickly. Ten 
years previous he contracted syphilis, but 
had considered himself well for nearly five 






»n of a syphilitic nature 
rved. For some time he had beei 
troubled with verj ■ nt headache . 

Meeting, lancinatii neuralgic tynj 

worse at night; also with pain in the regie 
of the liver. Was . nervous 

suffered from paroxysm- ol vertigo wit 
muscct vditantes; cious aj 

petite — sometimes voracious, sometimes al- 
most lacking. Examination revealed hyper- 
trophy of spleen, with much hepatic am 
gastric tenderness. His uri:. -f loi 

lie gravity; pulse feeble; respiratioi 
slow and at times labored. From the peci 
liar color of his skin, the fact that his he; 
ache and other troubles were worse at night 
and that his nervous system was so depresse( 
and in consideration of his having once suf- 
fered from syphilis, combined with the evi- 
dences manifested, I concluded that he wj 
a victim of specific tertiary sequela?, and ac- 
cordingly ordered him fluid extract caroba 
leaves, alternated with a mixture containing 
acetate of potash, berberis aquifolium, chio- 
nanthus, and iris versicolor. With this treat- 
ment, together with such occasional remedies 
as the changing condition of the patient ; 
called for, I was able to discharge him at the 1 
expiration of three months, and in better . 
condition than at any time for five years pre- 
viously. 

Case j. — Mrs. B , aged 40, married, 

mother of five children, and pregnant; com- 
plained of sore throat, to which she had been 
subject for years and for which she had been 
in the habit of treating herself — but her old 
and tried remedies had failed. She also com- 
plained of neuralgic pains in the sacral and 
pubic bones, very much aggravated and often 
excruciating at night; chloroform and mor- 
phine had been used freely without affording 
relief. I diagnosed her case as syphilitic, from 
the character of the ulcer in the throat and 
the nocturnal exacerbations of the neuralgia. 
A little later she was confined, when chan- 
croids and chancres appeared around the 
vulva, with syphilitic papdloma on the scalp 
and venereal sores on the roof of the mouth; 
the baby also had sores in the mouth, the 
characteristic copper tinge, and papilloma of 
the scalp. The remedies in this case were 
Phytolacca, thuja occidentalis, iris versi- 
color, chionanthus, iodide and acetate of 
potash; dilute solution of copper sulphate 
as a mouth and throat wash; the tissue salts 
as indicated — magnesium phosphate, potas- 
sium muriate, silica, and calcic fluoride. She 
made a good recovery in about ten weeks. 

Case 4. — J. F , aged 27, unmarried, con- 
sulted me in reference to a vesicle on the

lans penis. He was strong, rugged, of good 
hysique, and, apart from mental worry, suf- 
jred in no way. He was assured that he had 
ontracted syphilis, which would manifest it- 
slf in a few weeks or months by certain 
ymptoms characteristic of and peculiar to 
lis disease, which were explained. In seven 
/eeks he returned complaining of severe 
ccipital headache, and a copper-colored ab- 
ominal rash, patches on the tongue and roof 
if the mouth, and marked vascularity of the 
mcous membrane of the throat; there now 
smained no doubt as to syphilis. He was 
laced upon berberis aquifolium, stillingia, 
nd Phytolacca, and after two weeks on yel- 
)w dock and tag alder, with iron phosphate 
nd potassium muriate according to the re- 
uirements of the case, and in eight weeks all 
erceptible traces of the disease had vanished, 
ix months later some small white patches 
ppeared at three separate times, which soon 
isappeared under the use of the tissue salts. 

The all-important element in the treatment 
•f syphilitic sequelae is to restore the patient to 
condition as near perfect health as possible. 
r irst prohibit the use of all alcoholic bever- 
ages, then outline a course of living in strict 
.ccordance with hygienic law. — Emphasize 
l&gt; he necessity of this and sobriety if the patient 
rould be relieved. Local lesions may be treat- 
id and removed by appropriate methods, med- 
ical or surgical, according to circumstances. 
: In all cases of syphilitic sequelae a lowered 
''itality will be met with that will require a 
,onic treatment. My favorite prescription 
:or this purpose is: 

1 3 Quinine, io grains. 

Sulphuric acid, q. s. 

Fluid extract nux vomica, *io minims. 

Fluid hydrastis, 20 minims. 

Fluid extract Pulsatilla, 15 minims. 

Potassium acetate, 1 drachm. 

Cinnamon-water, 3 ounces. 
; One drachm three times a day. 

If proper attention be paid to the restora- 
:ion of normal vitality by the use of proper 
ood and proper hygiene, with an intelligent 
and painstaking selection of the indicated 
'emedies, vegetable or tissue, success can be 
ittained in the treatment of syphilis. But 
3e it remembered that after the more prom- 
nent symptoms are removed, the patient 
nust be under observation and treatment for 
at least three years for the complete elimina- 
:ion of the disease from the system.

Editorial 



WHAT IS THERE TO KOLA? 

This query is well answered by a paper 
appearing in the Scientific Review from the 
pen of Doctor Gustave La Bon. When he 
first began the study of Kola he queried if 
the action of the drug was not attributable 
to the contained Caffeine. But with the 
latter he obtained a stimulation much more 
cerebral than muscular, no increased resist- 
ance to fatigue, and always followed by 
depression; while the Kola nut, on the con- 
trary, induced prolonged stimulation, making 
it possible to withstand fatigue. This evi- 
denced that the active element of the Kola 
did not reside in the contained Caffeine 
alone. 

Then he experimented with Theobromine, 
and administered as high as one and a half 
grains of this salt on several occasions to a 
number of acquaintances and friends without 
their knowledge. The effect upon himself 
and others he declares to have been "en- 
tirely nil." Next, experiments were made 
with a combination of Caffeine one and a half 
grains, and Theobromine one-third grain, 
whereupon the effects observed were " very 
much beyond preconception, and identical 
with those obtained from Kola nut." He 
concludes: " For several weeks I made use 
alternately of pure Kola nut and of a mixture 
of Caffeine and Theobromine, without ob- 
serving any essential difference between the 
two products. I think, then, I may safely 
conclude that it is to the simultaneous pres- 
ence of these two bodies that the Kola owes- 
whatever properties it possesses, and more-

that the mixture of f alkaloids 

is valuable even beyond the properties of the 
f." 
tOI la Bon also queries why Caffeine 
and Theobromine when administered separ- 
ately induce such different effects than those 
pertaining to the mixture of the two alkaloids 
— a question he declares he is "obliged to 
ignore" until such time as he can obtain 
further evidence. 



AMNT PILLS AND INSOLUBLE HEDICA- 
MBNT5. 

It is well known that in certain physical 
conditions unsatisfactory results are likely to 
follow the employment of medication in pill 
or compressed-tablet form — whether these 
pharmaceuticals be made extemporaneously 
by the prescribed prepared by the retail 
pharmacist, or manufactured in quantities 
by the large pharmaceutical laboratories. 

Complaints to this effect are most common 
in districts characterized by the prevalence 
of so-called malaria. The malarious condi- 
tion is one "covering a multitude of sins," 
and presents many phases, prominent among 
which is either total inhibition of secretion, 
or excessive secretion of abnormal character 
— both these conditions tending to inhibit 
action of the medicament if it is not readily 
soluble. This class of cases, as a rule, re- 
spond more readily to the fluid form of medi- 
cation; yet the latter is not always conven- 
ient or possible. In even the torpid stomach, 
muscular activity is readily excited by the 
ingestion of any foreign substance, and is 
very apt to force a smooth body like a pill or 
tablet, coated perhaps with ropy mucus, into 
the intestine undissolved, and as a result the 
medicament passes on through the alimen- 
tary canal without disintegration. In many 
such instances the administration of a mod- 
erate amount of fluid — or, better still, a small 
portion of food — a few minutes prior to the 
ingestion of the medicament, will pave the 
way for the solution and absorption of the 
latter. But where the stomach is entirely 
subjective and devoid of secretion, it is vain 
to expect any medicament to be either dis- 
solved, absorbed, or digested; the occasions 
are frequent in malarial attacks and cerebral 
and other maladies wherein an entire meal, 



inge&gt; me boors previously, has been 

ted in precisely the same condition in 

which it entered the stomach. 

since there appeared in Brastm 
waste's Retrospect an a1 r by a 

prominent Knglish practitioner wherein were 
noted several at should by right have 

resulted fatally under the action of arsenic, 
morphine, and quinine, but in which the pa- 
tient owed his life solely to gastric inactivity. 
Instructions were given that twenty-four pills 
of this combination should be taken, one 
every two hours until relief was obtained. 
Two days later the practitioner received 
from the nurse information to the effect that 
all the pills had been ingested in accordance 
with directions, but that the faeces presented 
a peculiar appearance. Examination of the 
latter revealed the fact that the entire two 
dozen pills had passed undissolved. Only a 
few years since, also, the editor of this jour- 
nal prescribed a number of quinine pills, 
sugar-coated, and found later that the entire 
number had passed with the coating intact. 

In the first instance, what would have been 
the result had a sudden access of digestive 
activity dissolved the entire two dozen pills 
of arsenic and morphine; and what medico- 
legal aspects would have presented ? 

In addition to the risks involved in the 
passage through the stomach undissolved of 
a pilular or tabular medicament, comes the 
consideration of the fact that remedies, even 
when assimilated, differ in activity according 
to the peculiarities of the patient and of the 
disease. Thus, a cathartic prescription will 
act more freely, promptly and effectively in 
one person than in another; a medicament 
taken in health is quite a different matter 
from one administered in a condition of 
morbidity. We cannot, therefore, expect 
that any one formula will at all times and 
on all occasions act with perfect uniformity. 
The compound cathartics in the United 
States Pharmacopoeia, for instance, under 
varying conditions of bodily secretion, may 
have their activity either increased or greatly 
diminished ! This fact, coupled with the 
tendency to routinism which infests our pro- 
fession, has led to captious criticism of this 
compound (and it is only one of scores upon 
scores of pharmacopceial preparations that 
have been thus stigmatized). The result has

been the introduction of preparations under 
this title that are sophisticated, and of others 
which purport to be improvements; the intent 
in either instance being to secure an invariable 
cathartic effect without regard to formula or 
condition of patient. In some of these, for 
the colocynth compound (which if pure is a 
somewhat expensive preparation) is substi- 
tuted aloin, croton oil, elaterium, or certain 
of the Euphorbiaceoz, often in proportions so 
small as to defy the analyst— especially is 
this true of croton oil. This substitution is 
upheld by the plea of the necessity of secur- 
ing on all occasions an absolute cathartic 
effect, which is demanded by the average 
prescriber without regard to conditions. But 
the medical man should remember that in 
handling medicaments that are universally 
and unfailingly cathartic he has to deal with 
Jan indefinite and unknown quantity, and is 
moreover being swindled as to value, mone- 
tary as well as therapeutic. Aloin, croton 
[(oil, etc., may be much more active than colo- 
rcynth compound — they certainly are sold 
:imuch more cheaply than scammony, which 
lis the principal ingredient of the colocynth 
i preparation; but, valuable as they are in 
^their places as medicaments, it cannot be 
[said that they are preferable on all occasions 
to the latter. Finally, such substitution 
, speaks little for the honesty of the manufac- 
turer, who may well consider the applicabil- 
ity of the aphorism, "Falsum in uno, falsum 
in omnibus ." 

Neither a pill nor a compressed tablet 
: should be administered until some measure 
has been taken to secure its solution; 
i where the gastric viscus is lined with thick, 
[ropy mucus, even that uncertain therapeutic 
; abomination, the tablet triturate, if not previ- 
ously dissolved, may be equally inert. Under 
| such conditions it is often advisable for the 
patient to first take a glass of water, as hot 
as can be borne, in order to lave or flush out 
lithe stomach — to carry off its objectionable 
: contents into the intestines, — then partake of 
a bit of fruit or other food to excite gastric 
taction, and in a few minutes complete the 
performance by swallowing the prescribed 
drug. Pathological peculiarities and indi- 
! vidual idiosyncrasies must be kept in mind. 
Ilf, for instance, a cathartic is in question, 
and there is reason to believe this medica- 



ment has been wholly disintegrated or dis- 
solved and yet does not manifest its thera- 
peutic effect, it may then perhaps be proper 
to consider the advisability of administering 
some more active and irritating agent, like 
croton oil, to be prepared extemporaneously 
by the prescriber or his pharmacist. 

Here may be mentioned the fact that the 
aperient combinations of aloin or colocynth 
compound with nux vomica, belladonna, or 
atropine, sometimes appear to vary greatly in 
activity. This combination in a person of 
bilious temperament or of dark complexion 
is invariably less active than in one of oppo- 
site temperament; per contra, in flaxen-haired 
individuals, particularly those of the fair sex, 
this same aperient may simulate the activity 
of a drastic cathartic. Where activity in any 
way depends upon atropine or ^belladonna, 
extreme caution is necessary in administering 
to blonde females. . 

Recently, too, have been encountered pills 
and tablets the chief ingredient of which 
purported to be cascara sagrada, a drug that 
is in no sense a cathartic, and whose ap- 
parent action as such, consequently, can be 
secured only by undue sophistication; and 
the character of the stools and of the head- 
aches that followed were prima fade evidence 
of the presence of croton oil. 

In conclusion it may be said that it is not 
only frequently advisable, but sometimes 
imperatively demanded, that the form of 
the medicament should be changed from 
solid to fluid. In malarial conditions, qui- 
nine, especially its sulphate salt, is with 
great difficulty absorbed, hence is prefer- 
ably prescribed in the form of a liquid in 
conjunction with an acid, or of a powder 
encased in capsule. The muriate salt in 
connection with hydrochloric acid is greatly 
to be preferred, because of its superior as- 
similability, and also for its greater content 
of quinine alkaloid. 

Finally, the physician in prescribing for 
any malady should always bring to bear the 
actual and possible physiological relations of 
the drug to the pathology of the disease; and 
though pills and tablets may perhaps be pre- 
scribed with advantage and are more popular 
with the patient, the first suspicion of inac- 
tivity should suggest the employment of 
some other form of the drug.

During the week following the patient ol&gt;-

ten to thirty minims, with no water, followed 
by dorsal decubitus for at least five minutes 
irr order to avoid possible nausea and vomit-

given in the grave forms»of dysentery. 

This same measure was greatly advocated 
in Great Britain during 1859-68, and received 
general praise, though for some unknown rea

Doctor Adolph Bronner stated to the

disease is often overlooked, and is more com- 
mon than is generally believed. He did not 
recommend large openings, on account of the 
deformity that might follow; nor did he al- 
ways find it necessary, when the alveolar 
process was opened, to introduce a tube 
therein and keep it in position. 

Doctor Greville Macdonald maintained 
that it was the custom to trust for diagnosis 
too implicitly on the replacement of the pus 
in the middle meatus on bending forward the 
head. He had seen at least a dozen cases, 
some of them associated with antrum disease, 
others not, where suppuration in the frontal 
sinus produced the same phenomenon. As 
far as treatment was concerned — his remarks 
did not refer to cases with coexisting nose 
disease — he believed that an exploratory 
opening along the alveolar border, and drain- 



with the smallest- sized drainage tube

longer duration he occasionally found i 
to make a large opening for tht

good results. 



HERNIA CEREBRI. 

An Kastern exchange states that "th&lt; 
treatment, as laid down by Doctor Keen, for 
hernia cerebri, is to dress once or twice a day 
antiseptically, and if it heals very slowly to 
resort to skin-graftir \ 

All this may be very well, but the sooner it 
is recognized that hernia cerebri is a bugbear 
rather than otherwise, that it is the invaria- 
ble result of pressure from behind, and in 
the majority if not all instances due to at 
accumulation of pus, the better both for 
practitioner and patient. The relief from 
this condition of affairs is always the knife I 
And the knife is a much less dangerous or 
drastic remedy than is commonly imagined. 



EDITORIAL NOTES. 



Black Cohosh as a Local Anodyne. — 

To relieve the pain of photophobia. Doctor 
H. /. Gill, of Pittsburgh, recommends the I 
tincture or other fluid preparation of Cimici 
fuga. The fluid preparations of this dn 
hold in solution a considerable amount 
gummy material which on evaporation leav&lt; 
behind a yellow coating that can subse- 
quently be easily washed off. Doctor (nil 
considers it more definitely remedial in case 
of ulceration of the cornea and other inflam- 
matory conditions of the eye than any other 
drug; he applies by means of a camel-hair 
brush, using half a drachm for each eye, and 
relief, he declares, "is experienced in from 
fifteen to twenty minutes, and will continue 
from half an hour to half a day." 

He has also found it relieves otalgia when 
painted around the ear. Latterly he has 
found the fluid extract, with a strength of 
ninety-four per cent., as made by Parke, 
I )avis &amp; Co., the most satisfactory prepara- 
tion. He declares Cimicifuga racemosa is one 
of our most valuable anodynes.

An article on the hypodermatic syringe, by

lief portion of which is taken from the intro- 
uction to Bourneville and Bricon's " Hypo- 
ermic Medication," published by Mr. George 
I. Davis, of Detroit. We do not know how 
le publisher may feel about the matter; yet, 
pile the unconscious assimilation may be 
Dmplimentary, due credit would have been

Erysipelas Toxins.— 

There is no longer any doubt that the treat-

&gt;y erysipelas toxins is a complete failure. 



Clergymen of Letters, and What They Know 

of Medicine.— 

« 

In a recent article by Zangwill he relates a 
fable with a moral: "A pretty grey Mouse 
was in the habit of sauntering from its hole 
every evening to pick up the crumbs in the 
dining-room. 'What a pretty Mouse!' said 
the Householder, and made more crumbs for 
Mousie to eat. So great a Banquet was thus 
spread that the noble-hearted little Mouse 
cheeped the news to its sisters and its cousins 
and its aunts, and they all came every even- 
ing in the Train of its Tail to regale them- 
selves on the remains of the Repast. 'Dear, 
dear!' cried the Householder in despair, 'the 
House is over-run with a plague of vermin !' 
And he mixed Poison with the crumbs, and 
the poor little Pioneer Mouse perished in 
contortions of agony." Moral: Don't. 

Several Episcopal clergymen, along with 
some Baptist brethren, a few eminent (?) 
Methodist divines with tails to their names, 
and a Congregational whose tail has not yet 
sprouted, one day crawled out of their theo- 
logical hole and partook of the feast spread 
for them by a certain patent remedy. And 
having tasted of this great health giving re- 
storative, their magnanimous and unctuous 
souls swelled within themselves and they de- 
sired to let others know. Some of them with 
the tail Dangling Downward, others with it 
Drawn Closely 'Longside of them, and yet 
others with it Lying Loosely Behind, saun- 
tered forth and proclaimed to the suffering 
thousands what a healer they had found. 

As to this particular instance, we have 
nothing to say, but how often have we seen 
the Eminent (?) Divine stand on the public 
platform and denounce the liquor traffic, the 
rum-seller, yes, and even the physician who 
has used, perhaps, the only remedy that will 
keep life in a dying body. And have we not 
known him on his way home to call on some 
convalescent parishioner and advise him to 
take some nostrum — "It did me so much good 
when I was just like you" — little knowing 
that its chief and perhaps its only value de- 
pends upon the large percentage of alcohol 
that it contains. Moral: Don't. — Ontario 
Medical Jour?ial. 

Butter versus Hargarine.— 

Bacteriology has now metaphorically seized 
butter by the throat. If milk, the bacteriolo- 
gists say, is a great vehicle of disease, why 
should not butter be? The reasoning is fair, 
and there is no answer to the query. The 
scientific examination of butter has begun. 






THE MEDICAL AGE. 



The experiir.- working at « 

ferent geographical centre r-ch of the 

li of tuberculosis, found them. One of 
the bacteriologists inoculated guiru 
with the I pment 

of tul - rwenty of batter, 

purchased in twenty different markets, were 
examined, and, with tceptions only, 

found to contain the bacilli in qu&lt; 
In another I \ty per cent, of the 

samples contained the germ. Mr. Van Den 
Bergh stated the other day that butter was 
inferior to margarine. We wonder if he had 
in his mind these bacteriological results as 
well as chemical ones. — Food and Sanitation. 

Degeneracy.— 

Medicine, in common with other arts and 
sciences, has suffered from the tendency to 
degeneration. The epidemic of fads with 
which the profession has been afflicted — bac- 
teriology, tuberculin, animal extracts, et al. — 
are all results of this condition. But medical 
men have not the same excuse which the 
laity might plead for being led astray. They 
should be able to distinguish between science 
and degeneracy, genius and insanity, the false 
and the true, if they are to practice the exact- 
ing vocation of medicine. There is, however, 
a slowly widening rift in the cloud of oppro- 
brium which has darkened the medical hori- 
zon. Many of our best men are taking an 
unqualified stand upon the side of right and 
truth, and we hope, ere long, to see the pres- 
ent era of false prophets and fetichism rele- 
gated to oblivion. — Medical Brief. 

The Distinction.— 

Cockney Employer (to Highland game- 
keeper addicted to a drop o' the cratur) : "Now, 
then, Donald, you really must amend. Your 
breaches of regulations cannot be tolerated 
much longer. You will be liable to instant 
dismissal otherwise." 

Donald: "Mend my preeches, serr ! Why, 
serr, ton't you see me wearing ta kilts? It iss 
her nainsel' woot nefer tiskrase her goot Hie- 
lant leks with preeches, ant it iss your nain- 
sel', serr, can tismiss me when you catch me 
in preeks, ay ant gife me ta sack mirover. 
Preeches inteet; as if I woot risk catching 
cold wearing such things! " 

nodern Teetotalism.— 

The Medical Times says there is a great 
boom in temperance saloons in the East End, 
London. The public houses are deserted, and 
the " ginger pop " shops are besieged by clam- 
oring crowds of thirsty souls — and the East 
End thirsty one is a masterpiece of his kind. 



- sudden conversion— after temperaa 
lecturers, the Salvation Army and a 
other reform cies had fail* 

an in the imbibing procliv 

the East Bnder — has puzzled the I 
reformers sorely. The clew to the n 
has, however, been dis I by Mr. S 

public analyst for Bethnal (ireen, who ha 
ana'.;. imple of the ginger \\ 

temperance beverage shops and found it t 
contain ten per cent, of proof spirits, or a 
alcoholic strength just double that of ordi 
nary beer. — Medical Record. 

Sex in Eggs. — 

Some years ago there appeared in a G 
man paper a method by which the sex of egg 
could be distinguished, viz.: In the evening 
hold them to a bright light to observe when 
the air cell is located, which can be seen 
a dark spot about the size of a five-cen 
piece. In the male chicks it is located at I 
thick end of the egg, while in the female it 
located at one side of the end. I have mad&lt; 
use of this freely, and in consequence have 
nearly all pullets and only a few cockerels 
the latter having been hatched on purpose.— 
Poultry Keeper. 

Salacity in riedical Journals.— 

The Woman s Medical Journal for March 
last in one editorial fiercely denounces the 
"salacious in medical journals," and in an 
other as strongly endorses a new aphrodisi 
as " one of the few specifics we have; t! 
results obtained from its use in impotence 
were really surprising." The juxtaposition 
of the praise of the aphrodisiac and the dis-l 
covery of salacity in the medical journals is 
amusingly suggestive, to say the least.— 
Medical Standard. 

Consumption.— 

Brother Lawrence, of the Medical Brief A 
says he is of a consumptive family; "hence, 
early in life, made two resolutions: To gain] 
all possible knowledge concerning consump-; 
tion, and to decline having the disease. The 
results are an extensive library pertaining to! 
tuberculosis, vigorous health, and a firm con-: 
viction that the disease is due to malnutri- 
tion, assisted by those habits of life which j 
tend to decrease the vital force." 

How is This? — 

A Chicago correspondent of the Medical' 
Summary coolly asserts that " the communi&lt; &gt;n- 
table is the source of much drunkenness," 
and should be done away with unless some- 
thing besides wine can be used. If this be

[ Doctor G. Apostoli. Vol. I. Paper; 8vo; pp. 
: 748. Societe d'Editions Scientifiques, Paris,

; Apostoli has devoted many years to the 
linical study of electricity as a therapeutic 
gent in gynaecological treatment. The pres- 
jnt volume embodies a number of the more 
'mportant contributions to the literature of 
he subject, translated into French from the 
English, Belgian, Austrian, Danish, Polish, 
iungarian, and Canadian literature, and rep- 
esents a vast amount of editorial and original 
abor. It is well worthy of study by those 
Vho are interested in the remedial potency 
! 'f the electric current. 



Therapeutic Brevities. 



Cocaine in Local Ancesthesia. — It is not gen- 
erally realized that weak solutions of cocaine, 
employed hypodermatically, will induce local 
anaesthesia as successfully as the stronger 
ones commonly prescribed. The feebler solu- 
tion is not only an economy, but, what is far 
more important, it avoids the very dangerous 
result of intoxication induced by five- or ten- 
per-cent. solutions. For two years Professor 
Roux of Lausanne has used only a one-per- 
cent, solution, which he has found sufficient 
for such operations as herniotomies and re- 
moval of goitres, without any general anaes- 
thesia. Schleich uses even a weaker solu- 
tion, and has found that a 0.02-per-cent. 
solution produced anaesthesia after injection. 

A formula which allows of a cocaine solu- 
tion being kept for use without fear of dete- 
rioration is: 

Cocaine muriate, 0.20 gramme. 

Morphine muriate, 0.02 gramme. 

Sodium chloride, 0.20 gramme. 

Carbolic acid (5-per-cent. solution), 0.13 

gramme. 
Distilled water, 93 grammes. 

This is for use on painful areas; for opera- 
tions on healthy parts the amount of cocaine 
is reduced one-half. — Practitioner (London). 

* 

The amount of cocaine used in local 
anaesthesia must be* in proportion to extent 
of surface it is desired to anaesthetize; in no 
case should the quantity exceed one grain 
and three-quarters. 

Cocaine should never be used where either 
heart or pulmonary disease exists, nor in 
persons of highly nervous temperament. 

In injecting cocaine, the intra-dermatic 
method is preferable to the hypodermatic. 
By injecting into — not under — the mucous 
membrane or skin, the risk of entering a 
blood-vessel is avoided. 

During injection the patient should always 
be in a recumbent position, and in operations 
upon the nose and throat the head should not 
be raised until anaesthesia is complete. 

It is of great importance that the cocaine 
should be absolutely pure, since its combina- 
tion with certain other alkaloids results in 
poisonous compounds. — Brooklyn Medical 
Journal. 



The Danger of Ancest/ietizing Diabetics. —

nine collected from medical literature, and

diabetics; even in slight cases the patients 
:ie comatose and died, though the coma 
did not develop until the chloroform narcosis 
had passed off, sometimes not until 
twenty-four to forty-eight hours had elapsed. 
The patients became indifferent, stupid, and 
confused, and finally lost conscious 

1 urine and ^voluntarily; and 

died ID coma. This is important, since it 

rs the administration of chloroform is 

rous even when there is but a slight 
degree of diabetes, it being impossible to 
predict whether or not coma will develop. 
— Deutsche Medicinische Wochenschrift. 



Phulluah. — This drug, derived from a plant 
indigenous to the hills about Nani Tal, India, 
is largely employed by the native tribes for 
frost-bites and chilblains. When topically 
employed it is said to benefit rheumatism 
and sprains. A case of hemiplegia also is 
reported where rapid result followed the use 
of Phulluah combined with massage. — Medi- 
cal Annual. 

[This appears to be identical practically 
with the Dhilo Oil made in the Fiji, Tonga, 
and other Pacific isles; and the necessity for 
massage is rather suggestive of the fact that 
the latter is the chief remedy. Our own ex- 
perience with Dhilo Oil is that it forms a 
good dressing for patent leather. — Ed. Age.] 



Seminal Emissions. — Potassium bromide, 
the popular remedy, is often unsatisfactory; 
sometimes it even aggravates the condition, 
perhaps deepens the despondency that com- 
monly accompanies this condition. A num- 
ber of physicians have given up the alkaline 
bromides, preferring Hyoscine, administer- 
ing one-two-hundredth of a grain at bed- 
time. The effect is nearly always favorable, 
and frequently affords permanent relief. If 
Hyoscyamine is employed instead of Hyos- 
cine, it is important to stop short of the point 
where the physiologic effect of the drug is 
manifested. One advantage is, either Hyos- 
cine or Hyoscyamine properly administered 
can be continued for months without appre- 
ciable ill effects. — Philadelphia Polyclinic. 



Phytolacca Decandra in Epithelioma. — This 
is a most valuable remedy in epithelioma. 
"I bruise the green leaves to a pulp, express 
the juice, evaporate to thick paste, spread 
on a piece of silk or cloth, and apply, remov- 
ing and reapplying twice daily until the 
morbid growth is destroyed. A band of 



cicatricial tissue begins to spread from the 
periphery, and as this occurs the plasi 
made smaller each day to conform to the size 
and shape of the diseased mass. I ha\ &lt; 

• epitheliomata destroyed in a few weeki 
ami nothing but a faint scar remain. It is 
safe, can be used fearlessly, and in no i i 
there a recurrence." — Doctor K. ( '» Goofl 
man, in North Carolina Medical Journal. 



Action of Iron on the Organism. — The re- 
sults of Rosendahl's experiments seem to 
show that the iron salts of the Pharmacopoeia 
are not assimilated by the alimentary i anal 
of man or mammals if this tube is in a nor- 
mal condition. After their administration 
by the mouth they cannot serve as material 
for the elaboration of hrcmaglobin, nor direct- 
ly influence it. For the treatment of chlorosis, 
Ferratin is much superior to the preparations 
of iron in use at present, and this new remedy 
may be destined to replace the latter, since 
the principal object of treatment of chloros 
is to increase the strength of the blood in 
haemoglobin. — Medical Review. 



Hydrocele. — Insert a trocar into the most 
dependent part of the swelling, and draw off 
the fluid. Then inject a five-per-cent. soln 
tion of Carbolic acid, and remove almost 
immediately. The trecar is introduced a 
second time and pushed up toward the high 
est point of the sac, where a counter openin 
is made. A drainage tube is then pass 
through the openings and left in situ. The 
patient can immediately get up and wal 
about; the drainage tube may be withdra 
on the fourth day. In a week the patient 15 
permanently relieved. — Medical Press and

The Produ 

prom Fungi. — 

This uiese ch&lt; 

1 Jokichi Takam . i h e study- 

b, V. K.s., at Gla 
nceived the idea of improving 

the n. • brewing and distilling — that is 

sfied himself that better convert - 

id fermentii btainable, 

and that the tedious, costly, and not 
healthy pi s f malting was a clumsy and 

primitive mode of obtaining a converting 
agent in the form of the small production of 

ieveloped at so much sacrifi 
the grain treated. On returning to Japan, 
Mr. 1'akamine. jointly with Professor Atkin- 
son of Tokyo University, who published oc- 
nal contributions on the subject, under- 
took a long and exhaustive series of studies 
and experiments on many kinds of micro- 
scopic fungus or mould-growth, his object 
being to find a class of plant containing the 
two qualities of converting starch in cereals 
into sugars, and the sugars so obtained into 
alcoholic spirits. The various ferments and 
processes of the East, as well as of Europe, 
were one by one investigated only to be dis- 
carded by him; the ergots of rye and other 
plants whose qualities and powers are well 
known were not neglected; many kinds of 
bacteria were studied, when eventually this 
chemist discovered what he required in the 
fungus of the species Eurotium oryzce, a 
mycelial of the Aspergillus family whose 
nature and characteristics were almost un- 
known. The qualities required and found in 
this fungus were three-fold — that is, the 
plant having the two qualities he was seeking 
had to possess another quality, that of being 
capable of withstanding a high artificial cul- 
tivation or development of the two qualities. 
The best and most practical medium used 
for growing the seed of this microscopic 
fungus is common hydrolized wheat bran, on 
the flakes of which the plant grows with 
great rapidity, and whilst growing it, to re- 
produce its own seed, is fertilized with cer- 
tain chemical salts, and when matured, a 
process of about five days' duration, he calls 
it "Taka Moyashi." When grown for com- 
mercial purposes it is not fertilized, neither 
is it allowed to ripen in the same high-class 
cultivation in this form, the commercial prod- 
uct being known as "Taka Koji." 

On examining Taka Koji with a micro- 
scope the bran flakes show, after being 
thirty-six to forty hours in a moist tempera- 
ture of So F., that the roots which spread all

the ferment or agent which COnve 
into sugars, the Qnripe I with 

the pollen, and which may 
this condition spores, give rise to ti:&gt; 
pent or agent which converts t: 
into alcohol and which now takes the 
of yeast, as the d: malt. 

Strange to say, when both characters: 
the fungus are at their best in this inferior 
Cultivation as described, their property 
at their highest stage of commercial utility; 
but should the higher temperature and ferti- 
lization be resorted to, it is found that the 
diastase is entirely absorbed from the roott 
by the seed in the head of the mycelial, 
which it serves to nourish and ripen, and 
when the two agents become one, capable of 
reproducing their genera, it is found to be of 
little use for either purpose — for converting 
or fermenting. Mr. Takamine obtains his 
diastase in an almost pure and concentrated 
form by the use of percolators, washing the 
diastase from the bran with water, in whic 
it is soluble, but not so in alcohol, in whic 
it is precipitated. When dried it is of a pur 
crystalline nature, capable of preservation 
for any length of time. 

The purified diastasic product consis - 
small, tenacious, gummy particles of a light 
brown color, and somewhat of the appear- 
ance of finely broken shellac; it is almost 
devoid of taste, but it communicates a pecu- 
liar sensation on the tongue, indicative of 
active digestive properties. An analysis which 
we made gave the following results: 

■ 

Moisture 15-46 

Albuminoids (N = 3.65) 22. So 

Mineral matters, consisting chiefly of soluble 

phosphate 16.22 

Non-nitrogenized matter, probably carbo- 
hydrate 

On trying a weighed portion with a standard 
starch solution it was found that over one! 
hundred times of its weight of starch was 
completely converted in thirty minutes at 
blood heat. Doubtless at higher tempera- 
tures it would convert even a much larger 
quantity, it being stated that under favorable 
conditions it will digest as much as a thou- 
sand times its weight of starch. Hitherto 
the digestive properties of diastase have been 
appropriated chiefly by using active extracts 
of malt, which of course contain a large ex- 
cess of malt sugar, which in certain cases it 
is desirable to exclude. The use of the 



THE MEDICAL AGE.

"Takamine diastase" therefore offers obvi- 
ous advantages on this head. It can be 
employed, for example, for the malting of 
milk preparatory to drying, while it can be 
introduced almost imperceptibly to the taste 
into beer and other beverages without adding 
objectionably to the sugary constituents. It 
can also be compressed into tablets and in 
that form be obviously useful for a variety 
of medical and dietetic purposes. The ex- 
pense of obtaining diastase by the new 
[process is so small that it will be cheaply 
! available for all purposes, including that of 
i bread-making. It is this product of the new 
[discovery, but in a less concentrated and in a 
less expensive form, which is expected to 
take the place of malt to a great extent in 
'breweries and distilleries, while the ferment 
is calculated to replace the present yeasts of 
commerce in consequence of its greater 
; power', quicker action, and superior keeping 
qualities. 

As already stated, Taka Koji possesses two 
distinct properties — namely, diastatic prop- 
erty, or property of converting starch into 
| sugar, and fermenting property. It is ex- 
ceedingly important from an economical 
I standpoint to separate these two properties, 
as well from the Taka Koji as from each 
i other — a separation that has never before 
I been successfully accomplished on an eco- 
nomical scale — so that when a conversion is 
! desired the ferment property need not be 
; wasted, and when fermentation is desired 
only the ferment property of the Taka Koji 
'may be employed without waste of the dias- 
Itatic property. The ferment portion may be 
directly separated from the dried Taka Koji, 
in the form of a fine powder, by sifting the 
Taka Koji. This powder comprises the 
bloom of the fungus and possesses ferment- 
iing properties in a remarkable degree. The 
! residue left after sifting contains the diastatic 
[property, and may be used as a diastatic 
agent. These two properties may be ex- 
tracted together from the Taka Koji by. 
soaking or steeping the same in water, thor- 
oughly stirring and then pressing the mass, 
the diastatic property dissolving in the water, 
and the ferment part, insoluble in water, be- 
l coming detached by attrition and remaining 
[suspended in the liquid. The soaking or 
steeping, separating and pressing operations 
[may be repeated as often as may be desired, 
.'in order to effect a thorough separation. The 
; ferment may be separated from this solution 
[by decantation or filtration. It is, in the form 
;of a fine dry powder, composed of young, 
immature spores of the mycelial fungus, the 
color varying with the different fungi em- 
tployed. It consists of microscopical spherical 



cells possessing the property of being trans- 
formed into alcoholic ferment cells when 
submerged in sugar solution under suitable 
conditions. Fermentation with this "Taka 
Moto," as it is called, proceeds with remark- 
able regularity and briskness, the liquid hav- 
ing all the appearance of a weak acidulated 
solution of sodium bicarbonate, so brisk is 
the effervescence. On microscopical exam- 
ination the deposit was seen to consist of 
budding cells perfectly uniform and regular 
in shape and like the spores of mucor or 
some allied fungus, which have pullulated 
instead of producing a mycelium. Mr. Taka- 
mine uses the microscopic fungus Eurotium 
oryzce. with the best results. But other mould 
fungi belonging to the genus Aspergillus and 
to the genera Mucor and Penicillium may also 
be employed. The Moto may be dried and 
used for all the purposes for which com- 
mon yeast is at present used. It is claimed 
that the aspergillus yeast for bread-making 
will work in half the time required by yeast, 
and will produce sweeter and more whole- 
some bread. It is, besides, less liable to be- 
come sour, as the Moto itself will keep for 
almost any length of time in ordinary climates 
and temperatures. It is further stated that 
the Moto has the power of mastering all 
injurious and parasitical ferments it may en- 
counter, and of giving off its ferment cells 
of a perfectly regular and pure kind. — The 
Lancet (London). 



A Review of Pseudo-Medical Science. — 
We have reared a great science, and are now 
endeavoring to tear it down with our own 
hands ! Germs surround us everywhere. If 
we believe that infectious diseases are caused 
by germs, prophylaxis becomes impracti- 
cable. We have plenty of remedies for the 
relief of disease, but none that will effectively 
kill germs. A belief in germ infection leads 
naturally to medical anarchy. We cannot 
prevent infection, because we cannot get a 
corner on germs. We cannot relieve the 
conditions they produce, because, in order to 
destroy the germs, we must injure the vitality 
of the tissues. 

What shall be done? One mistake en- 
tangles us in an intricate web of error. The 
fad treatment of infectious diseases follows 
germ pathology as naturally as night follows 
day. It is an open declaration of the impo- 
tence of medical science. It says: We can- 
not prevent disease, neither can we cure it. 
We must leave it all to nature. — No, not all, 
that would leave us without occupation; we 
cannot afford that. So, without regard, to 
law or logic, the deluded scientists who pro-

Brief. 

-♦ 

Fruit-eating. — The value of fruit of vari- 
ous kinds in the dietary of the average 
healthy individual cannot well be overesti- 
mated. When it causes indigestion it is 
usually because it is taken at wrong times, 
and not because it is necessarily difficult of 
digestion. The proper time to partake of 
fruit, whether cooked or raw, is at meals, and 
not, as is so frequently done, at odd times 
throughout the day. At this season of the 
year most persons are the better for restrict- 
ing the amount of nitrogenous food and 
indulging in raw fruit and green vegetables. 
It must not be lost sight of that fresh, un- 
cooked vegetables ought to form a substan- 
tial part of our daily food. Cooking, though 
it may facilitate the digestion of fruit, does 
so at the expense of the peculiar quality of 
freshness, the absence of which in the long 
run gives rise to serious disturbances of 
nutrition. A belief has gained ground of late 
years, based on a misconception of certain 
general statements, that fruit is harmful to 
persons with a tendency to gout. If it is 
cooked and sweetened by the addition of 
cane sugar, no doubt dyspeptic disturbances 



are likely to occur, bi&gt;t no possible draw 
attaches to the use of raw fruit in proper 
quantities, provided it is ripe. The 
contained in fruits are of the greatest value 
to the organism and are not obtainal 
anything like the amount required from any 
other source. Children in particular should 
be encouraged to partake of fruit as part and 
parcel of their meals, and if proper care be 
exercised in the selection of a ripe and 
undamaged article, and in the giving of it at 
suitable periods, no disturbance of the intes- 
tinal functions need be apprehended. In 
conclusion, it is a generally accepted maxim 
that fruit and alcohol do not go well together.

A Constant Sign oi Commencing Men] 
[NGITIS. — This consists in the inharmonious 
movements of the chest and diaphragm. It 
exists from the beginning, and may serve to 
reveal its cause even in insidious cases, but 
requires careful searching. The chest and 
abdomen must be bared, but not suddenly, 
or the hyperresthetic skin will take on acci- 
dental movements from the action of the air. 

In the first period of meningitis may be 
seen irregularity of rhythm and inequality of 
the amplitude or development of the chest. 
Another sign is the irregular type of respira- 
tion and dissonation of the movements of 
chest and diaphragm. The respiration is 
effected by the lower respiratory muscles of 
the chest. Looking at the umbilical region, 
instead of the normal elevation with each 
inspiration, there is either immobility or de- 
pression. These movements are not con- 
nected with the Cheyne-Stokes type of res- 
piration. — Times and Register.

ABDOMINAL NEPHRECTOriY, WITH CASE. 

BY REUBEN PETERSON, M.D. 

Operations for the removal of a kidney are 
not of such frequent occurrence as to inhibit 
reports of single cases; for this reason I have 
thought the following might be of interest: 

Miss A. C , American, aged 22 years; 

single; house-maid. Family history nega- 
tive, except that she thinks her father died 
of some kidney trouble. When eight years 
of age she fell and sustained an injury to the 
right side which kept her in bed for two 
weeks; since then she has always had more 
or less pain in that side, usually dull (but oc- 
casionally so severe as to confine her to bed). 
As she grew older the pain became more 
severe and more disabling. She first noticed 
blood in her urine at the age of nine, and this 
appearance was of almost daily occurrence 
thereafter until her eighteenth year, since 
; which time it has been observed only during 
attacks of pain. About two years ago she 
had quite a severe seizure in the right side, 
accompanied by a cessation of menstruation; 
(Doctor Murphy, of Chicago, diagnosed the 
trouble as cystic disease of the kidney, from 
a lump situated just at the border of the 
jright ribs. (The patient had noticed this 
tumor for six years.) Some fluid was drawn 
off, and an operation advised. After this she 
liwas laid-up for some time with severe pain 
and fever. Next she went to St. Joseph's 
Hospital, where she was under the care of 
Doctor Senn, but he could find no evidences 
•of cystic kidney. Then Doctor Henrotin 
'was consulted, who made a vaginal examina- 
tion and found a cyst of the right ovary, 
which he removed by cceliotomy; she made 
ija good recovery from the operation, but the 
Ijpain in the right side still continued, and 
iwas so severe in character as to prevent her 
from working. At times the urine contained 
Considerable blood. 

Examination, made September 26th, 1894, 
Rave no evidences of cystic kidney, but there 



was some tenderness in the right vaginal 
fornix which was considered to be due to the 
stump of the excised right tube and ovary; 
accordingly she was sent to the Butterworth 
Hospital, and there treated locally with 
ichthyol tampons for over two months, dur- 
ing which period the urine showed no evi- 
dences of any kidney trouble, the amount 
passed being about normal. She gained in 
flesh and strength, color and appetite im- 
proved, but the pain in the right side still 
persisted. After consultation with Doctor 
Eugene Boise it was decided to make an 
exploratory cceliotomy for the purpose of 
ascertaining the cause of the suffering — the 
question of possible chronic appendicitis was 
considered, as the pain was located in the 
region of the appendix. It was suspected 
there was either trouble with the kidney or 
the appendix, or adhesions from the previous 
cceliotomy. 

Assisted by Doctor Boise, I operated De- 
cember 3d. An incision was made three 
inches in length in the right linear semi- 
lunaris over the region of the appendix, 
which was found to be perfectly normal. 
The stump of the excised right tube and 
ovary was next examined, and nothing ab- 
normal was found in connection therewith; 
no ligature was present. A systematic ex- 
aminat on of the entire abdominal contents 
was then made, which resulted in the dis- 
covery, beneath the peritoneum and in the 
region of the right kidney, of a fluctuating 
tumor. The left kidney was palpated and 
found to be apparently normal. The peri- 
toneum was cut through over the centre of 
the tumor until a blue, glistening cyst-wall 
was disclosed. The tumor was then care- 
fully dissected from its bed, which proved to 
be a most difficult and delicate task because 
of the thin wall and the density of adhesions. 
The kidney was finally cleared in all direc- 
tions, except the pedicle made up of the ureter 
and renal vessels. The ureter was isolated 
and cut midway between the silk ligatures 
which were applied. One large silk ligature 
was placed around both artery and vein. 
Forceps were then placed close to the kid- 
ney, and the mass removed. The stump was

made an uninterrupted recovery. The stitches 

removed on the ninth day, and the wound 

'Hind to have healed by first intention. 

The patient is now free from pain and able 
to do light work. The urine was examined 
illy after the operation. About the 
normal amount was passed in the twenty- 
four hours, showing that one kidney was able 
to do all the work.* 

Regarding the diagnosis of cystic disease 
of the kidney by means of the cystoscope 
and the use of ureteral catheters: Only 
since Howard Kelly's work on the bladder 
and accessories has it been practicable to 
make use of catheterization of the ureters 
means of diagnosis of disease of the 
kidney. By means of Kelly's instruments 
both ureters may easily be catheterized and 
the excretion from each kidney carefully ex- 



*Pat Report by Doctor J. B. U'hinery — 

The kidney at the time of removal had become 
changed into a fluctuating, lobulated kidney-shaped 
tumor. The length was six inches, breadth four 
inches, weight one pound; surface smooth, and no 
evidences of inflammatory action. On palpation, 
calculi ranging in size from a grain of sand to a 
pea or a little larger could be detected scattered 
through different parts of the tumor. On making 
an incision into the mass, twelve ounces of brown- 
ish-colored liquid escaped, which, however, was not 
subjected to chemical or microscopical examination 
because the tumor had been in preserving fluid for 
some time and more or less osmosis had taken 
place. the kidney structure had disap- 

there remained only pouches separated 
from each other by septa of fibrous tissue, in which 
free calculi were found, about two dozen in all, some 
of a dark clay-colored appearance, others dark 
brown; a thin crust of crystals covered a few of 
the calculi. Firmly imbedded in the mouth of the 
ureter was a dark-brown calculus th&lt; 
hazelnut, completely occluding the lumen and pre- 
venting the passage of urine. Of the- kidney struc- 
ture, only a small portion, varying in thickness 
from a mere shell to three-quarters of an inch, WAS 
left. Microscopical examination of this remaining 
kidney structure revealed atrophy and a function- 
less condition of the secretory elements. 



amii' it additional 

thus obtained. In the case j 

there is no question but thai 
catheter into the right ureter would have 
shown that no fluid was coming from the 
ding kidney. The amount of fluid 
eted from each kid: 
mined, and thus the surgeon 
to the advisability of the 
when the other is slightly I; in short, 

the diagnosis of surgical of the kid- 

ney has been placed on a scientific basis, and 
much more accurate and successful work 
may be confidently looked for in the future. 
The advantages of abdominal over lumbar 
nephrectomy for such cases as the one re- 
ported, are evident. Had the incision been 
made in the loin, it is doubtful if the dense 
adhesions could have been separated — cer- 
tainly not without rupture of the cyst wall, 
thus materially complicating the operation. 
With the abdominal incision the field of oper- 
ation is brought plainly into view and the 
work of enucleation may be carried on both 
by sight and touch; and the shock attendant 
upon opening is offset by the greater rapidity 
with which the kidney can be removed. 
Lumbar nephrectomy, even though the peri- 
toneal cavity be not opened, is attended 
usually by great shock, because of the neces- 
sary strain to which the renal vessels are 
subjected in bringing them into position for 
ligation— the operator is almost invariably at 
a disadvantage, no matter how extensive the 
incision may be. Mynter relates of a recent 
case that his arm was buried nearly to the 
elbow in attempts at enucleation. One can 
thus readily understand the dangers attend- 
ing the ligation of the renal vessels. One of 
the chief causes of secondary haemorrhage is 
ligation of vessels while on the stretch, and 
the slipping of the ligature usually proves 
rapidly fatal — a difficulty that is avoided 
when ligation is through the abdomen. Again, 
dissecting-room experience teaches that anom- 
alies in the way of blood-supply to the kid- 
ney are by no means uncommon, and these 
can be seen and provided for better by the 
abdominal route; the latter method also en- 
ables one to carefully palpate the sound kid- 
ney before removing the diseased one: for it 
has happened that a kidney has been removed 
and the post-mortem revealed the fact that,

although diseased, it was the only renal organ 
present. The possibility of such accidents 
should be continually borne in mind and care- 
fully guarded against. 

Shall the cut edges of the posterior perito- 
neum covering the tumor be sutured ? If the 
kidney be in its proper position, removal will 
leave a large hollow into which the edges of 
the peritoneum drop in such a way that union 
readily takes place; the raw surfaces left after 
peeling out the kidney (which is usually ad- 
herent) are covered by the peritoneum, and 
thus the abdominal cavity is shut off from the 
retroperitoneal space. And yet, while sutures 
can be dispensed with in some instances and 
no unfavorable symptoms supervene, in other 
cases if there is no great amount of shock and 
the peritoneum not too redundant I would 
certainly unite the peritoneal edges by a run- 
ning catgut stitch, feeling that by so doing I 
had left the peritoneum in a more favorable 
position for speedy union than by any other 
method. 

Drainage, as a rule, should be employed 
only when absolutely necessary. As applied 
to nephrectomy it differs from other abdomi- 
nal cases in the fact that the retroperitoneal 
space may be drained through the loin, while 
the abdominal cavity can at the same time 
be closed without drainage; and this would 
seem to be the most satisfactory method to 
employ. Gauze is in the main preferable to 
rubber tubing, owing to the tendency of the 
latter to collapse and thus prove worthless. 

In disposing of the ureter, two ligatures 
should be applied and severance made be- 
tween them; stitching the end of the ureter 
into the abdominal wound, as is the custom 
of some, is totally unnecessary. If the con- 
tents of the ureter are believed to be septic, 
the end should be cauterized;' otherwise it is 
simply dropped after ligation and excision. 

I have wondered whether the history of 
the injury to the right side in the case just 
reported could have had any influence in the 
production of the calculi and the subsequent 
develdpment of the hydronephrosis; certainly 
a blow may produce a blood clot within the 
kidney, from which a calculus can subse- 
quently develop. 

The history of paroxysms of pain, and of 
haemorrhages from the bladder, would lead 
to the conclusion that these were induced by 



frequent passages of calculi along the ureter, 
and that finally one larger than the rest 
lodged in the mouth of the ureter, when 
hydronephrosis resulted. 

In conclusion let me say that this case has 
taught me a valuable lesson: it is, to place 
more credence in the patient's statement in 
regard to pain, and if it be located in the 
abdomen, and the position be constant, to 
make an exploratory incision to clear up the 
diagnosis.

THE NEURO=MOTORY DISTURBANCES OF 
THE LARYNX. 

BY DR. P. RAUGE. 

The term "neuro-motory disturbances" has 
been applied exclusively to the functional 
disorders which attack the larynx through 
the agency of its nervous apparatus, the 
organ itself presenting no material lesion. 
This definition excludes all the motory per- 
turbations springing from a primitive affec- 
tion of the muscles; from an articular lesion; 
from one of those mechanical obstacles to 
the functions of the glottis interposed by con- 
gestion of the mucous membrane, the pres- 
ence of a tumor, or the thickening of a carti- 
lage. With these limitations and exclusions, 
all motory disturbances of nervous origin, 
whatever be their nature or cause, may be 
brought into the following category. 

The nervous apparatus of the larynx may 
undergo at some one point in its course an 
alteration of its own tissue (traumatism, in- 
flammation, sclerosis, relaxation, haemor- 
rhage), or, what is more common, may react 
to an adjacent lesion (aneurysm of the aorta, 
cancer of the oesophagus, goitre, adenopathia). 
But be it primitive or secondary, attacking 
the conductors or the centres, this alteration 
of the nervous apparatus is expressed func- 
tionally by a disorder of innervation, which 
becomes exaggerated or perverted, lessened 
or entirely suppressed, according as the origi- 
nal lesion is irritating or destructive, partial 
or total. Muscular disturbance results, marked 
by excess or deficiency, and manifested, ac- 
cording to the case, by spasm or contraction 
— the paresis or paralysis of a muscle or of a 
group of muscles, or of all the muscles of the

larym on of motory function 

produces deformation of the . rifice, 

which by its chang • on or 

mobility indicates the seat and the nature of 
the muscular disturbai 

Hut the mechanical disorder is not alone 

I by an anomaly of the glottis (which 

must be in a manner divined, and which 
would be discovered only by chance if there 
iOthing to reveal its traces): it is most 
commonly revealed externally by apparent 
manifestations which involve the larynx at 
tunes in its vocal function, at times In its 
respiratory function, and at times concur- 
rently in both. These functional disturb- 
ances are the final culmination of the original 
nervous lesion; they are its symptomatic ex- 
pression, just as the glottic deformation is 
its mechanical expression. 

Such is the invariable succession of symp- 
toms in every neuro-motory affection of the 
larynx, establishing a continuous chain be- 
tween the form of the symptom and the seat 
of the lesion; and an attentive analysis of the 
links of this chain renders possible more or less 
certainty up to the point of ^etiological diagno- 
sis. This series of symptoms which I have 
just followed in their natural direction and 
normal physiological order, the clinician like- 
wise traces, but per contra he proceeds from 
the apparent symptom to the causative and 
invisible lesion. For example: A vocal or 
respiratory disturbance first attracts attention 
to the laryngeal apparatus. Examination 
reveals deformity of the glottis, the appear- 
ance of which evidences to the practiced eye 
the muscle or muscles involved, but nothing 
further as yet. Then must follow a physio- 
logical analysis, with nervous localization; 
and by taking into careful account the muscle 
or muscles involved and the manner in which 
they are attacked, ground may be found for 
suspecting whence comes the causative lesion, 
although, be it clearly understood, there is 
no absolute relation between the seat of the 
muscular trouble and the seat of the nervous 
lesion. 

This series of progressive steps made when 
analyzing an isolated case in the clinic, rep- 
resents faithfully the course and summarizes 
the entire history of the discussions which 
have centred about laryngeal motor troubles 
during the past twenty years. Prior to the 



lar\ ie, all that could be done 

base on an analysis of the external symptoms 
a di which was little in ad\ I the 

BSical distinction between vocal paralyses 
and respiratory paralyses, 
discovery rendered it possible to study at 
leisure the thousand shades of glotti- 
mation, it became a simple matter, compara- 
tively, to establish, in accordance with these 
variations, an interminable series of forms 
based solely on a rigorous analysis of mus- 
cular alteration; but despite its subtlety, this 
purely mechanical study could not be of any 
service in establishing a primitive nervous 
lesion. Only of late years has attention been 
diverted from the symptom to the cause, and 
to an interrogation of the normal function of 
the nervous apparatus and its morbid alter- 
ations. 

In all the animated discussions with re- 
spect to laryngeal neuro-pathology, the great 
guide is pathological anatomy and nervous 
physiology. The wide bearings of the sub- 
ject compel me to confine myself to that 
phase which is at once the most novel and 
the least known — the anatomy and patho- 
logical physiology of the nervous laryngo- 
motory affections; and I shall rapidly sketch 
the route of the motory nerves of the larynx 
from their nuclei of origin to their terminal 
branches, dividing my sketch for the sake of 
clearness into three divisions: The centres, 
the roots, and the trunks. Each of these de-' 
partments has a corresponding problem in 
the neuro-pathology of the larynx, viz.: The 
question of the cortical centre: Participation 
of the spinal in the laryngeal innervation: 
Pathogeny of the permanent adduction (pa- 
ralysis of the abductors). 

It is impossible to grasp the question of 
the centres of the larynx, and the general 
mechanism of its motory innervation, without 
at the outset establishing the two different 
and antagonistic functions which the muscles 
of the organ alternately fulfill. The first of 
these functions is wholly organic, and main- 
tains the vocal cords in a state of active 
retraction corresponding to the needs of 
respiration; the other is a voluntary act 
which assures during phonation the contrac- 
tion of the glottis and regulates tension of its 
lips. — The failure to recognize this very 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 



389 



simple distinction caused the long and stub- 
born search in the medulla oblongata for a 
centre embracing all the modes of laryngeal 
activity. It is certain that the reflex which 
assures the opening of the glottis during 
silent respiration has its seat in the bulbar 
nuclei and escapes voluntary control. But 
the other function of the larynx — that which 
renders this organ the most perfect and the 
most complicated of musical instruments — 
must perforce derive its nervous influence 
from a more elevated region of the encepha- 
lon. The control of the glottis during sing- 
ing, and the part played by the larynx in the 
articulated word, are acts too superior and 
too eminently psychical to permit of a doubt 
of their cortical representation. There is 
even no good explanation why this laryngo- 
motory centre has so long been refused a 
place in the cerebral cortex, while the centres 
controlling the muscles of the face and mem- 
bers were so freely accorded this distinction. 

When Ferrier and Duret sought this func- 
tional locality in the cortical substance, they 
were not bent on determining simply a focus 
whence was directed the vocal adaptation of 
the glottis —that is to say, a simple element 
in the complex phenomenon of phonation. 
What they thought they could find was 
the centre of the voice, meaning a point in 
the cortex the excitation of which might 
suffice for bringing into play the multiple 
powers concurring in this choral act. It 
seemed to them that by compressing certain 
points in the cortical surface of a dog it was 
possible at once to provoke the complete 
phenomenon of barking, thus setting in mo- 
tion at one stroke not only the muscies of the 
glottis, but all the other mechanical elements 
and in part the expiratory contractions which 
must necessarily be associated to produce 
this sonorous phenomenon. 

Put in this form, the problem was naturally 
insoluble. To Krause is due the merit of 
circumscribing the question, and seeking, not 
the centre of the voice, which is a very com- 
plex act, but the centre of glottic adduction, 
which is an eminently simple act. To follow 
the movements of the cords in the animals 
under experiment, M. Krause first resorted to 
laryngoscopical examination with the mirror, 
then the opening of the laryngeal cavity by 
pharyngotomy. He finally hit upon a more 



simple process, which consists in drawing the 
larynx before the soft palate by traction of 
the tongue and epiglottis, the latter being 
seized by means of a dissecting-hook or 
cord. As a result he was able to determine 
in the dog a focus, the excitation of which 
produces in a constant manner adduction and 
— mark well this fact ! — bilateral adduction 
of the cords. This focus is situated in the 
anterior branch of that U -convolution which 
embraces the crucial furrow in its superior 
concavity and which is designated in all the 
mammiferous animals by the name of sig- 
moid gyrus. This anterior branch of the 
sigmoid gyrus, which Krause, following the 
nomenclature of Owen, calls the prefrontal 
gyrus, is more familiar under the name of 
praecrucial gyrus. The exact seat of the 
adductory focus is in the lower part of this 
praecrucial gyrus, at the level of the con- 
tracted bridge which forms a species of isth- 
mus between the praecrucial gyrus and the 
anterior gyrus. 

Seven years later the essential results of 
these experiments were confirmed by Semon 
and Horsley by tests made not only on the 
dog and cat, but on divers varieties of the 
monkey — the animal species whose cerebral 
topography approaches nearest that of man. 
In the brain of carniverous animals they also 
located with precision the centre of bilateral 
adduction at the junction of the praecrucial 
gyrus with the anterior and coronal convolu- 
tions; but they discovered further that the 
motory action of adduction was greatest at 
the level of the focus, extending in decreas- 
ing power through the lower two-thirds of 
the praecrucial gyrus and below in the upper 
extremity of the anterior gyrus. It was re- 
served for M. Masini to accentuate still fur- 
ther this species of diffusion of the primitive 
laryngeal focus, and to extend it not only at 
its surface to the greater part of the motor 
brain, but also in its depths at the site of the 
white subcortical substance. 

But the truly original part of Semon and 
Horsley's discoveries was the localization of 
the laryngeal centre of the monkey, permit- 
ting by a legitimate analogy the establish- 
ment of its probable situation in man. The 
Rolandic region of the macaque presents be- 
fore Roland's groove an ascending frontal 
convolution which does not differ appreciably 



S90 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 



the human bram. At the base 

of this junc- 

tion with the third frontal, v. Semon 

and Horsley have been able to fix the place 
of the pi f laryngeal centre. This 

centre they claim has two limits: forward, 
the pr . furrow (prae- Roland ic fin 

S ire of Sylvius; behind, a little 
furrow without name which rises vertically 
from the fissure of Sylvius anil divides almost 
y into two parts, following its vertical 
axis, the foot of the ascending frontal: above, 
a horizontal line passing through the upper 
extremity of the preceding furrow. 

As far as one is justified in drawing con- 
clusions from experiments on animals, it 
seems that in man there must exist in the 
borhood of Broca's region a zone of the 
motory brain presiding over the adduction of 
the cords, that is, their phonatory activity; 
and this also has been established by Krause, 
Semon, Horsley, Masini, Onodi, and others. 
But in that event how explain the fact that 
this psycho-motory centre has never revealed 
its presence in man by the pathological dis- 
turbances which must follow its lesions? If 
there exist a laryngeal centre, as there exists 
a language centre or a motory centre of the 
members, how are we to explain the fact that 
we do not encounter clinical aphonias of cor- 
tical origin, or hemiplegias of the glottis — 
similar to the motory aphasias or the cortical 
hemiplegias of the members? Situated, like 
motory centres, in the territory irrigated by a 
branch of the Sylvius (ascending frontal 
artery), the laryngo-motory centre should not 
logically escape more than any other the 
pathological lesions consecutive upon rupture 
or obliteration of this branch. Yet on ex- 
amining, several hours after apoplectic ictus, 
a large number of subjects suffering from 
aphasia or from hemiplegia of the members, M. 
Semon did not observe a single case in which 
the motility of the larynx seemed at all com- 
promised. 

To explain this contradiction between ex- 
perimental theory and clinical results. M. 
Semon appealed to a detail in the experi- 
ments which I purposely emphasized — the 
bilaterality of the movements produced in 
the larynx by excitation of a single hemi- 
sphere. This fact indicated to him that the 
psycho-motory direction of the glottis is not, 



like that Of the members, divided symmetri- 
cally between tWO the right and left, 
the action of which, unilateral and en 

ilted individually on each half of the 
ins that the . icting 

- m concert, do not need to i. 
its independent motory centre, and 
union represents an undivided - LCtioJ 

bilaterally and in a mass through a single 
cortical centre. And as this bilateral action 
belongs indifferently to each of the two 
hemispheres, the result is that the function 
is doubly assured. If one of the centre- 
appears, the surviving centre is equal to the 
task; or, speaking clinically, the lesion of 
one of the laryngeal centres is necessarily a 
lesion without symptoms, since it is alw. 
compensated lesion. 

Semon and Horsley support this affirma- 
tion by a striking experimental proof. On the 
one hand they destroyed in the animal the 
region of the laryngeal centre — nay, more, 
they completely removed a cerebral hemi- 
sphere— and, despite this mutilation, observed 
a persistence in the normal movements of the 
glottis; even the vocal cord opposed to the 
hemisphere removed failed to present the 
least appearance of paralysis, and electric 
excitation of the surviving laryngeal centre 
continued to produce bilateral adduction of 
the cords as in the unmutilated subject. 

Hence hemiplegia of the larynx is abso- 
lutely impossible. Either one centre is at- 
tacked and its lesion remains mute; or the 
two centres are destroyed, when there is no 
longer a hemiplegia but total paralysis which 
may be observed at the level of the glottis. 

Aside from this doctrine, which denies even 
the possibility of laryngeal hemiplegia, 1 pro- 
posed two years ago a less brilliant hypothesis 
of the incontestable clinical rarity of such ob- 
servations; I thought, and still think, that if 
hemiplegia of the larynx so seldom accom- 
panies asphasia or hemiplegia of the mem- 
bers, it is because it is seldom sought for in 
the clinics of general medicine, and because 
most of those who show the cerebral lesions 
which produce it fail to present themselves 
to the mirror of the laryngologist. There 
now exist a certain number of authentic cases 
in which laryngeal hemiplegia, duly estab- 
lished during life by laryngoscopical exami- 
nation, could only be explained at the autopsy

by a lesion of the laryngeal centre or of the 
intra-cerebral fibres which it thrusts out 
toward the bulbar foci. 

I am aware that M. Semon persistently ad- 
mits the probability of an unknown bulbar 
lesion which is to be regarded as the veri- 
table origin of the pretended cortical paraly- 
sis. This stubborn skepticism in the face of 
the most serious observations proves only the 
imperturbable fidelity of M. Semon to his ex- 
perimental convictions, despite the opposing 
evidence of the clinic. 

The affirmations of the clinicians are fur- 
ther supported by physiology. Thus, M. 
Masini, by bringing very feeble currents to 
bear on the cortical surface at the level of 
one of Krause's regions, observed that the 
glottic contractions became limited to, or at 
the very least predominated in, the opposite 
vocal cord. In a series of more recent ex- 
periments the same author found that an 
application of cocaine or an injection of this 
substance at the level of the laryngeal centre 
determined the crossed paresis of a single 
vocal cord. We all remember the solemn 
challenge provoked by the publication of 
these results, and the open letter in which 
MM. Semon and Horsley invited M. Masini 
to repeat his experiments before the Section 
of Laryngology of the International Congress 
at Rome. The Italian author accepted the 
challenge, but it is only just to admit that the 
attempts at demonstration, in which I assisted, 
were not particularly convincing at that time. 

When we read of a case of cortical laryn- 
geal paralysis we may be almost certain of 
rinding the statement that one of the two 
vocal cords is fixed "in the cadaveric posi- 
tion." In this simple phrase is a physio- 
logical heresy on which it is needless to 
dwell. I have already stated that the larynx 
fulfills a double function — the vocal and the 
respiratory— and it is the first alone which is 
represented in the cortical layer. The first 
function, therefore, and the first alone, can 
be involved or destroyed by a cortical lesion, 
without this lesion attacking in the least the 
respiratory function, which has its origin in 
the bulb; and so true is this that we may, as 
Semon actually did, remove the two cortical 
centres, and even remove "the entire brain 
including the internal capsule as far as the 
lamina of the fourth ventricle," without caus- 



ing any injury to the respiratory function of 
the larynx. Now, the same must be true of 
a case of pathological lesion in man, and a 
cortical paralysis must be by definition not a 
complete paralysis but a vocal paralysis, with 
absolute conservation of the tonus dilatateur 
which represents in the activity of the larynx 
the purely organic side and responds to bul- 
bar innervation. Hence the state of -a vocal 
cord attacked by a lesion of the cortical layer 
should not in any case be that state of in- 
ertia producing the cadaveric position; on 
the contrary, it is a state of abduction which 
is nothing else than the respiratory position, 
and it is abnormal only in that it has become 
persistent, and that the cord, deprived of its 
adductory centre, remains in permanent sub- 
jection to the abductory action of the bulb, 
without being ever again able to approach 
the median line. The practical consequence 
is that the glottic deformations produced by 
the cortical lesions remafn completely masked 
during silent respiration; they appear only 
at the moment when the patient makes a 
vocal effort, and when the paralyzed cord, 
refusing to lend itself to the movement of 
adduction, rests obstinately fixed in the atti- 
tude of abduction, or the respiratory phase. 
It is true that the healthy cord, exaggerating 
its normal excursion, seeks to approach its 
impotent congener and disguises in a meas- 
ure the excess of the latter's deviation. This 
doubtless explains the laryngoscopical illu- 
sions which cause us almost always to esti- 
mate this deviation at more than its real 
value, and to speak of cadaveric position 
when in reality the case is simply one of ex- 
treme abduction.

TREATMENT OF INTERHITTENT FEVERS 

AND PERIODIC NEURALGIAS 

BY APIOL. 

BY DOCTOR C. DUCLOS. 

Since apiol was heralded by MM. Joret and 
Homolle as a succedaneum for quinine, many 
experiments have been made to determine 
definitely the antiperiodic value of the drug, 
and (as stated by Professor Bouchardat in 
Annuaire de Therapeutique) it has been dem- 
onstrated capable of at least supplementing 
quinine, if not actually replacing it.

all the

the express view of personally drawing there-

lic value of apiol. My observations, 

though perhaps possessed of little merit 

other than as a means of calling renewed 

attention to the active principle of pai 

(thus repeating the evidence contained 
in the [37 cases outlined in the memoir of 
Joret and Homolle), may nevertheless be of 
interest from the fact they were gathered 
without prejudgment and with the sole desire 
of determining positively the therapeutic 
value of the medicament. 

The cases are separated into two classes: 
those embracing intermittent neuralgias, 
ague-face, tic, etc., etc.; and intermittent and 
larval fevers proper, including fevers of ex- 
tremely rebellious character. 

I may at the outset anticipate the conclu- 
sions by stating that in intermittent neural- 
gias apiol seems to secure most marvellous 
results; but, on the other hand, in larval 
forms, especially when of a rebellious type, 
and in ordinary intermittents, its therapeutic 
action is much more limited. Further, I may 
be permitted to state (verifying the utter- 
ances of the authors of the memoir cited) 
that "Apiol, while it cannot be employed to 
the same advantage as quinine in combating 
grave intermittents, may well be substituted 
for the latter in the ordinary acute forms" — 
in the former, quinine certainly has proved 
more powerful and more satisfactory than 
apiol. 

Case 1. — M. C , aged 9 years; tendency 

to lymphatic temperament; discolored mu- 
cous membrane; cardiac palpitations; souftle 
in the vessels of throat; pale tint of com- 
plexion, and visage somewhat puffed, as in 
chlorosis. Resides at Ksches. a little village 
in the Canton Meru, situate. half a league 
from a marsh where cresses are cultivated. 
Early in August this child was seized with 
violent neuralgia in both ears, along with 



rior occi- 
put, that returned - with v 
shocks (chills) which caused her to give ut-

at about the same hour and with the 
characteristics. From a slight twinge at the 

Of the ear the patient was abl&lt; 
mine the reappearance of the pain, which 
was augmented by speaking, i etc. 

During the first fifteen day-, as there was 
no loss of appetite and sleep, and mor&lt; 
no evidence of swelling or redness in the 
afflicted parts, it was not thought nec&lt; 
to consult a physician. When the otalgia 
had persisted some three weeks, swelling of 
the parotids took place; the pain also be- 
came more and more violent, and the crises 
recurred as frequently as twenty times daily, 
and, instead of lasting merely a few minutes, 
were prolonged for a quarter and sometimes 
half an hour; at this period too, about 8 p.m. 
an exacerbation appeared, marked by general 
chill that was followed by a decided fever, 
perspiration, and insatiable thirst. Thu 
when the neuralgia had assumed its great 
intensity and the patient could no long 
secure sleep, I was consulted. 

August 27th, leeches were applied below 
each swollen parotid, and. as soon as they 
had fallen off, three capsules of apiol, of 
three minims each, were administered. The 
same evening the neuralgia disappeared as 
by enchantment: The following day three 
more doses of apiol were given, with the 
result that in a few days the parotids were 
free from swelling. 

A year later (June 22d),as a result of cold 
feet, the same girl was seized with a similar 
attack of otalgia, though the crises wer 
so severe or so prolonged as on the former 
occasion — they returned only about ten times 
a day and lasted not more than a quarter of 
an hour each time. The most 5 -arox- 

ystn, as before, was manifested at 8 p.m., and 
the entire night was passed in such suffering 
that sleep was impossible; the patient was 
warned of each recurrence of pain in the 
temples and occiput, by a slight shock at the 
of the ear; but this time the parotid! 
not swollen and there was no febrile 
movement during the crises other than as 
manifested bv insatiable thirst.

The rapidity with which relief was afforded 
in the first instance led the parents to sum- 
mon medical aid almost at once — when the 
malady had prevailed but four days. Ex- 
actly the same treatment was formulated, 
viz., leeches below the ears, and for two suc- 
cessive days three capsules of apiol five hours 
before the chief crisis. The evening the first 
doses were administered the otalgia entirely 
disappeared; indeed, the patient fell into a 
profound sleep, breathing much more heavily 
than was her wont. She awoke after nine 
hours' rest — rest that had been denied her 
for four nights owing to suffering. The fol- 
lowing day she vomited and evinced some 
nausea along with eructations strongly 
flavored with the pungent odor and taste of 
apiol. Appetite very good. Pulse 60; res- 
piration 20. The next day she appeared so well 
that the three apiol capsules ordered were 
not given, but the following night she was 
not nearly so comfortable, there being little 
sleep, though the pain was not marked. The 
following day the apiol was resumed, and 
from that time health remained perfect. 
'Every time the parents, who come to me 
occasionally, speak of the child, they express 
their astonishment at the rapidity of the 
cure. 

Case 2. — M. D , aged 68, a resident of 

Gicora, came to me on the 12th of July. He 
was a man of large stature, and presented all 
the characteristics of the nervous tempera- 
fment; for three weeks he had suffered from 
►neuralgia in the entire right side of face, 
■ characterized by intense pain in the brow, 
'cheek, upper jaw, and globe of eye; pressure 
at the opening of the suborbicular foramen 
was very painful; at times there were twinges 
tand darting spasms which greatly distressed 
the patient by their violence — often the pains 
&gt; prevented eating, sleeping, speaking, blowing 
of nose, and even movements of the head. 
IThis day, having traveled during the morn- 
ling in an open carriage against a very cold 
j wind, the suffering was so intense as to be 
; almost unbearable; the crises of pain re- 
\ :urred every five or ten minutes. He first 
I desired to have drawn the large molar of his 
i apper jaw, the only tooth remaining to him 
Dn the right side, believing it the cause of 
;he neuralgia; but as the tooth was sound, I 
• refused. Instead, four leeches were applied 
ander the angle of the jaw; and when these 
ll'ell off, six capsules of apiol were ordered in 
j;i single dose. Almost immediately, as in 
.he former case, the pains were subdued as 
{by magic, and the following day found the 
Datient radiant, having slept well, and anxious 
. :o thank me for so rapid and marvellous a 



cure. At the end of fifteen days the neural- 
gia had not reappeared, and he returned 
home. 

Case j. — E , a boy aged 10, living at 

Esches — the village already referred to as 
being the spot where intermittent fevers are 
endemic; very scrofulous; had sore eyes for 
a period of six consecutive months. In March 
he was, without known cause, seized with 
violent pain in right ear, the same recurring 
in intermittent crises from time to time during 
the day, but assuming an especially atrocious 
and agonizing character at night. In the 
morning suffering became somewhat abated, 
only to return again with great violence and 
increased intensity the succeeding evening 
at eight or nine o'clock. This had been the 
condition for three days when I was sum- 
moned. 

The crises were so sudden and so excru- 
ciating the night before that the child became 
fairly insane with pain, declaring each moment 
he was about to die. Leeches were ordered 
below the ear, and capsules of apiol to be 
administered three each evening during two 
consecutive days. After taking the first three 
capsules, the pain subsided as by enchant- 
ment; and although an abscess had formed 
in the right ear, and had not yet discharged, 
it gave little trouble, and evacuated itself 
the second night after the patient had ingested 
three more capsules. After the leeches and 
the apiol, sleep became excellent; neverthe- 
less, at the end of two days a second abscess 
supervened in the opposite ear, which how- 
ever was almost painless. The suppuration 
in both ears lasted about eight days, and 
finally terminated under the employment of 
instillations, drop by drop, of tincture of 
iodine, three times daily. The mother as- 
sured me the capsules of apiol arrested the 
pain. 

Case 4. — L , aged 30, a farm servant at 

C , a little village containing many pools 

of stagnant water, and in which numerous 
cases of intermittent fever occur every spring. 
After having traveled in an open carriage in 
a very cold wind, she was seized, on the 28th 
of March, with trifacial neuralgia occupying 
the entire right side of the head; during the 
morning and the entire day the pain was en- 
durable, but, beginning at the hour of rising, 
it augmented until evening, when it became 
intolerable and agonizing. There were twinges 
and twitches in the brow, cheek, and upper 
jaw, and during the severest crises pressure 
at the level of the suborbicular orifice was 
very painful. 

Four leeches were applied below the right

car, and daring two 

es of apiol were given each d the 

• March the pam w j derably 

diminished in intensity, though still predomi- 
nant in the evening: at night it was better 
much more cairn. The apiol, 
however, was very repugnant to the patient, 
producing nausea, eructations, and a consid- 
erable luring three cons, 
tive days. Though it did not completely 
rcome the neuralgia, there was marked 
improvement; ami when tincture of iodine 
in three-drop doses was instilled into the ear 
ted side, relief became complete. 

Case 5. — Josephine M , aged 32, a 

peasant laborer; for seven she had 

been subject to daily accesses of intermittent 
fever, which returned more particularly at 
the changes of the seasons. Early in Novem- 
ber she experienced great fatigue during har- 
vest, and had already suffered during six 
weeks from sciatic neuralgia of the left side. 
Every year at this epoch she suffered from 
pain in left lower leg, which, however, was 
ordinarily less violent and of shorter dura- 
tion than at the time when I was called. 
Nine years previously she had the same 
malady, when twelve leeches applied to the 
popliteal space gave relief for several days. 
When summoned I found the patient could 
walk very well until about eleven o'clock or 
near noon; then the pain began at the back 
of the foot with twitches and twinges, mount- 
ing to the back of the calf, the thigh, and 
the hip, stopping at the loins. Little by little 
the suffering increased as the day advanced, 
until in the evening she either limped with 
difficulty or could not walk at all — could 
not even undress without aid. Occasionally 
slight erratic chills were observed in the dis- 
eased limb, and during the first eight days 
there was oedema about the left instep. The 
pain was so severe for the seven or eight 
nights previous to my seeing her that she 
was hardly able to secure two hours' sleep at 
night; she was continually moving the leg in 
order to find for it at one time a cool place 
and at another time a warm one. The menses 
returned soon after the commencement of the 
malady, but did not subdue the erratic neu- 
ralgia. One day the pain was very severe, 
the next it subsided, proceeding in the regu- 
lar manner of tertian larval fever. 

During the first eight days I had her take 
eight grains of quinine; but this failed to in 
any way mitigate the intensity of the malady. 
I next applied twelve leeches to the popliteal 
space; then resorted to general venesection; 
finally made application of cups; all without 
satisfactory results. Later, for two consecu- 



r 1 



tive days sixty centigrammes of quinine 
taken daily, yet the pain showed no diminu- 
tion. ( &gt;n th( id 13th 1 ber I 
administered daily six capsules of apiol 
the same tune prescribing for ten COl 
tive days one centigramme of muriate 
morphine to be placed on the dermis 
the B rve previously denuded b\ 
cation. 

From that time the improvement 
noticeable, but it was a question whether it 
most due to the morphine or to the 
apiol. On the 14th of November, only three 
of the morphine powders had been ab&gt; 
still the improvement was surprisingly no- 
ticeable; thus, a half-hour after the applica- 
tion of the first vesicatory the pain subsided, 
but the patient had likewise taken six cap- 
sules of apiol. The succeeding day th&lt; 
continued to diminish, and so on until the 
third, when it entirely disappeared. She 
slept very well during two nights, though 
on the third there was a feeling of stupor and 
severe headache as though a band of iron 
encompassed the brow, likewise slight ring- 
ing in the ears succeeded by a very clamor- 
ous appetite. She believed her relief was due 
solely to the serum removed by means of the 
blisters; nevertheless, fifteen days before she 
had applied one which had taken away very 
much more serum and yet afforded no relief 
at all, and I therefore naturally inferred the 
benefit was due chiefly if not solely to the 
apiol. 

From the 15th of November up to the 21st 
of December she arose every day without 
suffering or limping, though at the latter 
date the blisters on the leg were suppurating 
abundantly and the foot was very cedematous. 
On the 27th there had been no return of 
sciatic pain; nevertheless the patient was di- 
rected to take six baths of aromatic vapor, 
and to wrap the thigh with a band of flann 
covered with sulphur.

Case 8. — M. L , aged 30; peasant la- 
borer at C ; possessed a very strong consti- 



tution and sanguino-plethoric temperament; 
in childhood was often subject to ep. 
and angina; at the age of 14 had typhoid 
fever which lasted six weeks; has always 
been regular, and the menses ordinarily very 
abundant, lasting four or five days; married 
at 22, and has four children; her pregnancies 
proceeded very well, save that she vomited 
during the entire period; all confinements 
normal. 

Fifteen days after her last confinement she 
took a bottle of black draught and coffee- 
grounds to induce a flow of milk. On the 
same day of this purgation, which doubtless

was somewhat too free, she was suddenly 
seized with a singular malady, which lasted 
eleven months, when I was called, October 
4th. 

This malady recurred in crises, during 
which there was atrocious pain radiating to 
the side and right hypochondrium, and at 
times to the right shoulder. During these 
crises of suffering, which drew from the pa- 
tient plaintive cries, the face was distorted 
and the voice profoundly modified; she com- 
plained also of feeling as if something ob- 
structed the stomach. After lasting one or 
two hours, the crises were terminated by an 
eructation of gas, which always relieved. At 
first the crises returned five or six times daily 
during two consecutive days; then did not 

• snsue oftener than every three or four days; 
ater on, made their appearance every eight 

[days; after some considerable period of time 
f;he interval became fifteen days. In the in- 
tervals between the crises — a fact which 

ilways gave much surprise — her health ap- 
i reared as good as at any time before con- 
(lnement. She often compared these crises 

o violent toothache or to the most severe 
pains of childbirth, as they were wholly in 

• ibeyance at some moments, only to resume 
i heir violence after a brief period of rest, 
i Oaring the first days in the month of Feb- 
ruary following, a violent neuralgia asserted 
ttself in both eyebrows, apparently secondary 
( o or resultant upon an attack of gastralgia, 
J.nd radiating into the jaws and all the teeth, 
teturning in periodic attacks in the same way 
Is that in the epigastric region. These at- 
tacks would confine the patient to bed for 
4W0 or three days; sleep was bad, and she 

ras harassed with anxiety and hallucinations. 

In the morning following, the urine was al- 

• ^ays turbid. At times there was no attack 

iuring the day; often it occurred in the 

rvening; almost always at some hour in the 

jarly part of the night. The crisis returned 

. t a moment when the patient expected it 

le least, and there was apparently no one 

ilment more potent in causing its return 

i lan another. On one occasion, however, 

le observed that after taking some honey- 

ater as a laxative she had indigestion, and 

lat the gastric neuralgia supervened upon 

le latter. There was never any evidence of 

liills or perspiration during the crises, and 

ley were always followed by stubborn con- 

ipation; indeed, the constipation was the 

principal symptom aside from the pain which 

* osorbed attention; and the patient was in 

liie habit of declaring that if she could only 

wcure perfect regularity of the bowels she 

'ould be relieved. She frequently also in- 

sted that the most severe attacks super- 



vened upon the cessation of the menses. 
The urethra was intensely congested at its 
external orifice, and was several times cau- 
terized with nitrate of silver. During the 
menstrual epochs there was always lumbar 
pain, more severe at night than during the 
day. 

After five or six months of suffering, her 
health began to fail; the complexion became 
yellow and earthy; there was less and less 
appetite; strength gradually gave way; diges- 
tion became painful, long, and laborious, 
being accompanied with epigastric distress 
after each repast. Finally there was pro- 
found emaciation, and her weight had. de- 
creased from 124 to 103 pounds. There 
were likewise cardiac palpitations, and pant- 
ing in walking; all labor became impossible; 
she fell into a condition of melancholy, sad- 
ness, and indefinable discouragement. The 
menstrual epochs returned very regularly, 
but the blood was black, viscous, tarry, anal- 
ogous to that observed in pyrexia, and the 
flow was much less abundant than formerly. 

She had resorted to a large number of physi- 
cians and quacks, and no form of treatment 
had prevented a recurrence of the attacks, 
which at the time I was called had persisted 
for eleven months; iron, anti-spasmodics, 
anti-dyspeptics, sedatives, had been resorted 
to without avail. After careful examination 
I could detect no evidence of organic affec- 
tion of the liver or stomach; there had never 
been any icterus or evidence of epigastric 
tumor; there was no cancerous cachexia, and 
no trace of such in the family of the patient, 
whose father and mother were still perfectly 
well though very aged. At the time I was 
called (October 4th) she was suffering a very 
intense gastralgic crisis, and there had been 
considerable dysmenorrhea during the even- 
ing, beginning at nightfall; respiration 32; 
temperature 104°; pulse hard, frequent, 100. 
This crisis was preceded two days before by 
a general chill, followed by hot flashes and 
abundant perspiration. The tongue was 
saburral, bitter; there was dysmenorrhea 
and constipation; the urine in the morning 
turbid; great weakness of limbs; on defining 
the outlines of the liver it was found to en- 
croach by the breadth of two fingers upon 
the costal and epigastric spaces, and more- 
over was exceedingly sensitive to percussion; 
the mammae were swollen, the nipples pre- 
senting a red border and bleeding upon 
touch; there was frequent belching of gas, 
with a sensation of suffering and likewise 
excessive hunger. 

After careful deliberation I diagnosed the 
case as one of masked intermittent fever, or, 
rather, one of those larval forms with con-

The morning pulse was 72; respira- 
tion 34; axillary temperature 95 . After 
. days there was a slight febrile attack, 

n accompanied with night-sweats, 

hallucinations, and a feeling of anxiety. 

Preliminary to other treatment a dozen 
leeches were applied to the region of the 
liver, and thirty centigrammes of quinine 
ordered daily for ten days. Cataplasms with 
e applied, also mercurial inunc- 
tions at the epigastrium; bouillon and wine 
daily. On the 24th of October a diminution 
in the volume of the liver was noticeable, and 
the gastric crises had little by little diminished, 
the patient thereby being very much relieved. 
From the 24th to the 30th the malady re- 
turned as violent as before, with the sole dif- 
ference that it now presented the character- 
istic of a quaternian fever, the patient having 
two good days between the attacks. On the 
29th wet cupping at the loins was resorted to; 
the blood was still black, viscous, and pitchy. 
The epigastric pains were subdued by means 
of opiates, ether-perles, and fluid extracts of 
opium and belladonna. The menses returned 
the day following the application of the cups, 
when the pain subsided. 

From the 1st to the nth of November, 
almost complete comfort was experienced, 
the patient manifesting only a little gastric 
eructation after meals, with slight palpita- 
tion; appetite and sleep considerably better. 
For the three weeks succeeding she took 
morning and evening a wineglass of quinine 
wine and a ptisan of lesser centaury in Mal- 
to these were added cold douches at 
the region of the liver, which seemed still 
enlarged, and a general cold affusion every 
quarter of an hour every second day. After 
the first douche she contracted a cold with 
mild bronchitis and violent toothache, when 
the gastralgia was resumed with great vio- 
lence, the crises occurring every evening at 
eight o'clock. There was dyspnoea, pain in 
the epigastrium, back, and right hypochon- 
drium, accompanied with very bad nights, 
exhausting dreams, sensation of hunger; tur- 
bid urine in the morning. The crises lasted 
three hours every day. On the 19th of No 
vember venesection was resorted to and sixty 
centigrammes of quinine were ordered for 
each of the two succeeding days; the douches 



ended. The blood at this tim&lt;

Venesection was again resorted to, and 

full gramme of muriate of quinine 
daily. December 10th, after fifteen da; 
comparative comfort, the crises appeared 
again, lasting two days, but were soon initi- 
gated by wet cupping at the epigastrium and 
the ingestion of one gramme of quinine 
muriate during two days. The patient, who 
during this time had not discontinued for a 
moment, in the intervals of the atta&lt; 
tonic and ferruginous treatment, manag 
regain something of her vigor and appetite. 
Strength and sleep were improved; si 
not now suffer except immediately during 
the attacks, and her countenance resumed its 
wonted expression as soon as she was able 
to eat. The last appearance of the menses 
had anticipated itself by fifteen day- 
the blood was better-colored than previ&lt; 
it was less black, less pitchy, less diflluent; 
the flow began on the 29th of November 

For a whole week previous to December 
25th there were slight crises every other day, 
The patient took each morning a tablespoon- 
ful of magnesia to overcome the constipation, 
thereby securing two or three liquid s 
every twenty-four hours. On the 21st of th 
month, during a severe attack, six leeche 
were of necessity applied to the vulva on ac-; 
count of the lumbar pains and for the pur- 
pose of inducing the menstrual flux. There 
was prolonged syncope. January 8th th 
menses had been suppressed for six wee 
and few days had elapsed without so 
manifestations of her old trouble. On t 
6th and 7th the pains returned as violentl; 
as on the 21st of December. An attem 
was made to relieve by substituting apiol I 
quinine; at the same time wet cups were ap- 
plied to the epigastrium. During four coi 
secutive days six capsules of apiol (eachj 
three minims) were administered, or twenty- 
four capsules in all. Sleep became better 
during the nights that followed, and appetite 
in the morning was greatly improved; the 
attacks were slightly modified by perles 
ether, much more so than by quinine. 

On the 10th of January the gastralgia had 
entirely disappeared. There was 1, 
slightest crisis, but on the 12th and 13th the

suffering reappeared, requiring the use of 
morphine, which was applied endermically 
by means of vesicatories over the epigas- 
trium. On the 19th another tolerably severe 
crisis ensued, that was relieved by bleeding 
and by the administration for two consecu- 
tive days of apiol in doses of four minims. 
The blood was no longer dark or pitchy. 
From that moment there was no return of 
the attacks, and the iron tonics were con- 
tinued with great perseverance. Little by 
little digestion improved, the countenance 
resumed its freshness, the pulse was invigor- 
ated, the souffle in the vessels disappeared, 
the sleep became sound, the urine clear, and 
the strength improved. The periods became 
regular, and the blood of natural color the 
same as before the onslaught of the malady. 
The succeeding months of February, March 
and April were passed in excellent health, 
and since that time she has had no relapse, 
though occasionally she resorts to prepara- 
tions of iron and wine of quinine. 

During the attacks, muriate of quinine in 
doses of one gramme, administered after 
bleeding, whether local or general, afforded 
partial relief, but it is just to also add that 
apiol acted in like manner and with much 
more vigor, proving the antiperiodic par 
excellence. A year and a half after my last 
attendance upon her I was informed she still 
retained good health.

APIOL IN AMENORRHEA AND DYSMEN= 
ORRHCEA. 

BY DOCTOR BAILLOT. 

Among the functional troubles of the uterus 
which the physician is frequently called to 
relieve, especially in cities and the manufac- 
:uring centres, amenorrhcea and dysmenor- 
■rhcea occupy a prominent place; and so dif- 
icult is it at times to determine the cause 
which gives rise to the malady, or maladies, 
r:hat physicians are generally forced to ac- 
knowledge their powerlessness in the relief 
Of these affections, and also are obliged to 
•esort to varied and uncertain methods of 
•herapeusis. 

• Some years since Doctor Joret, in the Bul- 
'etin de Therapentique, published a memoir on 
:he emmenagogue value of apiol, and made 
1 careful study of the numerous causes giving 
'ise to amenorrhcea and dysmenorrhea, form- 
ulating also the trite aphorism that diversity 
)f cause demands diversity of treatment. 



When either of these affections ensues as 
the result of plethora or anaemic or chloro- 
anaemic condition, or the general nervous 
superexcitation, it may perhaps be a matter 
of some difficulty to determine the precise 
manner in which the apiol should be em- 
ployed. According to Joret, it is indicated 
when the menstrual disorder proceeds from 
diminution, excess, or perversion of uterine 
vitality; when ovarian sensibility is consider- 
ably augmented; and when the irritation de- 
termines an altogether abnormal excitation 
of the genito-urinary apparatus to the extent 
of causing pain sufficiently severe to extort 
groans from the patient. 

But as it is not sufficient to give the first in- 
dication, and as it is essential to make known 
when and how apiol should be administered, 
Joret opines that the most opportune moment 
is at the period when menstruation is about 
to be established. This may be easily de- 
termined by the pain in the loins, the sen- 
sation of weight in the lower part of the 
abdomen, the nervous irritation, etc., all of 
which are more or less pronounced, and dis- 
appear after the lapse of several days, only to 
reappear periodically every four weeks. As 
to the mode of employment, he gives in the 
morning and evening, continuing after the 
appearance of the menses and during their 
duration, in the dose of three to four minims, 
in gelatin capsules. 

Desiring to examine the value of this med- 
icament, I prescribed it on several occasions, 
and must acknowledge I have been more for- 
tunate with it than with any other of the oft- 
vaunted emmenagogues; in evidence whereof 
I present four cases: 

Case 1. — Miss D -, aged 18; sub- fore- 
woman of a factory; of good constitution, 
having never been seriously ill; breasts suffi- 
ciently developed to evidence her having ar- 
rived at puberty; nevertheless has never 
menstruated. For several months she com- 
plained of having felt during several days 
about every four weeks a sensation of weight 
with dilatation of the lower adbomen, twitch- 
ing in the groins, and general malaise, with a 
tendency to melancholia; in the intervals of 
such crises she enjoys perfect health. I ac- 
cordingly took advantage of the reappear- 
ance of one of these attacks to administer 
daily two four-minim capsules of apiol, one 
in the morning and one in the evening. The

impanied with violent pain in the 

- and thighs, uterine colic, and scorch- 
it at the vulva. The entire series of 
the most vaunted emmenagogues were em- 
ployed one after another, but without relief. 
itly I had her take one capsule of 
apiol morning and evening the day before 
that on which she expected her period, and 
advised that the same treatment be followed 
during the continuance of the flux. From 
the very first day the flow continued with 
facility, and notably the pains in the uterus, 
groins, side-, etc., were lacking. This result 
rendered my recommendation to persist in 
the use of the medicament throughout the 
flux in some degree superfluous. Ever since 
her periods have occurred with the greatest 
regularity. 

Case j. — Madame H , aged 34; cotton- 
spinner; strong constitution and plethoric 
temperament; menstruated regularly from 
her seventeenth to her thirty-first year, and 
until the latter age her health had never 
suffered. Married at 30, she became a mother 
the following year; and beginning with this 
epoch her menses were not only less abund- 
ant, but occurred only in connection with 
very severe pain in the loins, the lower ab- 
domen, and the thighs, forcing her to take to 
her bed the day preceding their appearance. 
The dysmenorrhea had persisted for three 
rears. She was ordered a capsule of apiol 
in the morning and another in the evening of 
the 30th of October, when the menses ap- 
peared in greater abundance and without the 
slightest accident. The success of this treat- 
ment, which she had no reason to stop — 
previous measures having afforded her but 
slight relief — naturally prompted her to re-

DEATH FROn EMBOLISH(?) 

Editor Medical Age: 

Mary L , aged 25, of Norwegian pa- 
rentage, family history good, of heavy mus- 
cular physique, had never been ill save with 
the diseases incident to childhood. On the 
1st of March she noticed a peculiar fluttering 
about the heart — that it would strike heavily 
against the chest walls; also that her breath 
was short and she could not sleep well. 

March 20th I found on examination valvu- 
lar insufficiency, regurgitation, and feeble and 
irregular action. I prescribed digitalis in ten- 
drop doses, and applied counter irritation 
over the precordial region, keeping the pa- 
tient quietly in bed. 

March 21st. Had slept better; heart's ac- 
tion and respiration improved. Continued 
treatment, with a light nutritious diet. 

March 22d. Still improving. At 9.30 a.m., 
against my wishes, she got up and dressed, 
and remained about the house all day. At 4 
p.m. I was hastily summoned, and found her 
with complete hemiplegia. She had suddenly 
felt dizzy, then lost consciousness for a mo- 
ment and fell to the floor. Her attendants 
carried her to bed, and she was perfectly con- 
scious when I arrived. The paralysis was on 
the left side of the body, involving both head 
and extremities; sensation was very imper- 
fect on the affected side, but gradually 
grew better, so she was able to distinguish 
a pinch or a prick of a pin. She con- 
versed in an intelligent manner, did not 
experience any pain, but was very restless. 
I prescribed some bromide, and she passed 
the night quietly. 

March 23d. General condition about the 
same; sensation better; pupil dilated on the 
affected side; intellect cleared up till even- 
ing, when she began to breathe badly and 
have aberrations of intellect. I administered 
[strychnine and atropine hypodermatically, 
and gave spirits every hour. Intellect cleared 
up some; pupil still dilated; slight move- 
ment of the left arm; temperature 101 on 
right side, 100.5 on left. At 11 p.m. she 
was very restless, when I gave another hypo- 
dermatic injection of strychnine (-fa grain), 
atropine ( T \- grain), and morphine (%. grain). 
She went to sleep and rested well until four 
o'clock in the morning; then she was wake- 
ful, restless, and talked incoherently. 

March 24th. Condition about the same. 
Same treatment. 



March 25th. Aberration of intellect merged 
into coma; coma deepened; breathing ster- 
torous; lungs cedematous. Died in coma at 
6.30 P.M. 

Post-mortem examination could not be 
obtained. My diagnosis was embolism, 
arising from the diseased heart and find- 
ing lodgment at some point in the base of 
the brain. 

I earnestly solicit criticism upon the case. 
I regret post-mortem could not be had, since 
it would have cleared up any doubts as to 
diagnosis or pathology.

APIOL AS A REGULATOR OF MENSTRUA- 
TION. 

I have just obtained so signal results with 
Apiol in regulating the menstrual flux, that I 
feel it incumbent upon me to note the same 
for the benefit of the profession: 

Madame L , aged 28 years, childless, 

had never menstruated well; indeed, the 
menses were irregular, and never appeared 
twice in two consecutive months; the inter- 
vals usually were nine, twelve, or even fifteen 
months. All the most vaunted emmena- 
gogues had been prescribed in vain — she 
could never observe any benefit from any. 
Likewise she had visited various mineral 
springs and taken numerous mineral baths, 
without the least avail. 

I advised Apiol to be taken in the follow- 
ing manner: During the first month, four 
capsules of three minims each, in two days; 
during the second month, six capsules in 
three days; during the third month, eight 
capsules in four days. The drug appeared 
to be of little benefit during the first two 
months, but on the third occasion she took 
the maximum dose, that is to say eight cap- 
sules, which at once caused return of the 
menstrual flux, the flow lasting five or six 
days and unaccompanied by suffering — I 
mention particularly the absence of pain be- 
cause she had previously suffered excruciat- 
ingly from uterine colic, which persisted 
during the entire catamenial period. As on 
this occasion the pains did not recur, it may 
naturally be inferred that Apiol possesses 
the faculty of provoking the menses without 
irritating the chief generative organs. The 

same results continued with Madame L 

for five consecutive months without interrup- 
tion. 

This case seems to me remarkable, for it 
presented not an instance of temporary re- 
tardation, but of suppression so absolute and

LEPROSY AM) CHAULMOOGRA OIL. 
M u Aoi 

A few months ago an East Indian, aged 
j j, was found wandering about this city, ami 
when sent to the Pennsylvania Hospital for 
treatment was found to be a leper and trans- 
ferred to the Municipal Hospital. Being 
under my charge, I began the use of Chaul- 
moogra Oil and tincture of Hoang Nan, and 
now, after six weeks under this treatment, I 
am satisfied the patient is being considerably 
benefited. He is able to treat himself as 
far as bathing with the oil is concerned, and 
is very enthusiastic over the results accru- 
ing to the use of these preparations. He is 
very intelligent, having been a pupil at an 
Oriental medical college. This particular 
form of leprosy seems to tend to harden and 
thicken the skin in spots; and also from time 
to time a deep discoloration appears in dif- 
ferent parts of the body. The use of the oil 
externally seems to cause the blue discolora- 
tion to disappear, and bring the thickened 
skin back to its normal condition. Whether 
this is due solely to the oil, or to the use of 
both remedies, I am as yet unable to say, but 
after a more extended trial will submit a 
more detailed report.

EUPHORBIA PILULIFERA AND HUIRA = 

PUAMA. 

Editor Medical Age: 

The following is my experience with Eu- 
phorbii i pililufera : 

The patient, a male, 50 years of age, had 
suffered from a severe type of asthma for 
fifteen years. Degan treatment with fluid 
extract Kuphorbia on May 20th, giving 
drachm doses three times during the day, 
and another drachm at bedtime. 

This was continued without change until 
four ounces of the remedy had been taken. 
No material improvement in malady occurred, 
though the remedy appeared to render ex- 
pectoration easier and more abundant. 



I have treated one case of impair' 

th Muira Puama, The patient, 52 
bad been gradu ining 

. r during »1 fifteen J 

and while not completely impotent the 

tions and emissions premature. 

In every Other respect he was healthy and 

robust, but an inveterate tobacco-;. 

Began with drachm doses 
Muira Puama in water, three times daily, 
after meals, and continued until four ounces 
had been taken. During its administration 
there was manifested some increase in sexual 
desire, but no apparent improvement in erec- 
tile power, and no influence over premature 
emissions. 

The aphrodisiac power observed in this 
limited trial suggests that in a more pro- J 
longed administration of the remedy, with 
proper regulation of habits, it might prove to 
be a valuable agent in sexual debility. This 
trial demonstrates that it merits further in- 
vestigation, when we take into consideration 
the long standing of the case and the age of 
the patient.

TAKA-DIASTASE AND DYSPEPSIA. 

Editor Medical Age: 

Permit me to say a word regarding this 
new digestive ferment. I recently treated 
ten cases of amylaceous dyspepsia with this 
remedy with most satisfactory results. All 
suffered with continuous pain between meals, 
fullness and distressed feeling throughout 
the entire intestinal canal, and a moist tongue 
coupled with disagreeable taste, especially 
marked in the morning upon rising. One 
case which had ^resisted all forms of treat- 
ment for a period of ten years, and in which 
the condition of the tongue could not be 
changed by diet or the administration of any 
drug, the patient also suffering habitually 
from water-brash, obtained permanent relief 
by the administration of six-grain dos 
Taka- Diastase after each meal and just be- 
fore retiring at night; in all she took but 
eighteen doses. 

Judging from the foregoing it appears to 
me that Taka-Diastase is a remedy of espe- 
cial value, and much more practical in its 
application than any of the digestive ferments 
hitherto employed. 

Very truly vours,

Reports of Societies, 



WINDSOR MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. 

A regular meeting of this organization was 
held Tuesday, June nth, 1895, at the office 
of Doctor J. O. Reaume, President Chas. W. 
Hoare in the chair. Present: Doctors Coven- 
try, Carney, Cruickshank, Going, Prouse, 
Pare, Casgrain, Brooks, Sanderson, Samson, 
Aikman, Reaume, Ashbaugh, and Campbell 
of Detroit. 

The minutes of the previous meeting were 
read and approved. 

Doctor Coventry, Chairman of Delegates 
to the Ontario Medical Association, reported 
the latter had voted to meet in Windsor in 
1896. Report accepted and a vote of thanks 
extended to the delegates. 

The report of Committee on Lodge Prac- 
tice was again laid over. 

President Hoare then called upon Doctor 
Don M. Campbell to read his paper on "Gon- 
orrhceal Conjunctivitis." 

Discussion. — Doctor Prouse never uses 
nitrate-of-silver solution at the commence- 
ment, but waits until severe inflammation 
has subsided; cold compresses, and douch- 
ing as often as possible; leucorrhceal dis- 
charges will produce an inflammation very 
similar to gonorrheal. 

Doctor Coventry endorsed the paper; al- 
ways sends patients to hospital if possible; 
is strongly opposed to scarification as prac- 
ticed by some. 

Doctor Reaume has had great trouble in 
having treatment carried out; depends greatly 
on proper nursing. 

Doctor Hoare referred to the fact that the 
disease is very amenable to treatment in the 
infant, but quite the reverse in the adult. 

Doctor Campbell was very much pleased 
with the way in which the paper had been 
received. The most important change in 
treatment was the resort to milder methods. 
Referring to Doctor Hoare's remarks, would 
say that in the infant the inflammation ex- 
pends itself on the palpebral portion of the 
conjunctiva, and in adults on the ocular por- 
tion — thus a greater percentage of infants 
make a good recovery; perhaps this is bn 
account of some further development of oc- 
ular portion in the adult, leaving it more 
susceptible to inflammation. 

Doctor Hoare gave details of a case he 
supposed to be cerebro-spinal meningitis, in 
a delicate child with poor surroundings. She 
had been skipping the rope a good deal. 
Onset sudden; extreme pain in head and 
joints; screaming when asleep; marked opis- 



thotonos. Temperature from 102° to 104 . 
Absolutely deaf from onset, and remained 
so ever since, although she has recovered 
and is perfectly well in other respects. 

Doctor Cruickshank related a case of con- 
tinued fever with opisthotonos; became per- 
fectly deaf, with gradual recovery. 

Doctor Samson told of an epidemic of cer- 
ebro-spinal meningitis occurring some years 
ago, the victims being chiefly children of 
from ten to fourteen years of age. The 
onset was sudden, with high fever; intense 
rigidity; pain in head. The course of the 
malady embraced five or six weeks, and 
about one in four was left perfectly deaf, a 
condition from which many never recovered. 
In matter of treatment the head was shaved 
and blistered, very hot cloths applied to back 
of neck and spine, bromide of potassium and 
ergot given internally. 

Doctor Prouse related a case similar to 
Doctor Hoare's that persisted nearly three 
months. Temperature was very high and 
there was great emaciation. After trying 
various remedies he at last gave large doses 
of quinine, which brought the fever down, 
with the result of immediate improvement. 
There was total loss of hearing, and one eye 
became inflamed and the sight lost. 

Doctor Carney had several cases with tem- 
porary loss of hearing; gave ergot, potassium 
bromide, and chloral for the spasms. 

Doctor Campbell remarked the case re- 
ported by Doctor Hoare was the first he had 
seen so early. The auditory nerve was im- 
plicated. If inflammatory products are ab- 
sorbed soon enough, hearing will return. 
He employs potassium iodide to favor ab- 
sorption. 

Doctor Hoare thought the case had not 
been discussed from the proper standpoint. 
It was never alarming in any other respect 
except that the hearing was lost from the 
onset. 

Doctor Casgrain had seen cases of cerebro- 
spinal meningitis with deafness, and some- 
times with strabismus as well, and both 
conditions are apt to be somewhat slow in 
disappearing. Employs potassium bromide 
and Calabar bean. 

Doctor Casgrain extended an invitation 
from the Water Commissioners to the Society 
to be present with them on a trip to Lake St. 
Clair for the purpose of investigating the 
river current and taking samples of water for 
analysis. 

Society adjourned to meet at the office of 
Doctor Going, on the evening of July 9th.

APIOL. 

Ever since the active principle of parsley 
was discovered and evidence afforded of its 
therapeutic qualities, the impossibility of se- 
curing a uniform and satisfactory product 
has been a source of great annoyance to prac- 
titioners; so much so, indeed, that the use of 
this valuable medicament has been abandoned 
by scores of physicians who would very much 
like to avail themselves of its properties. 
Even works on materia medica and thera- 
peutics seem to be at loss as to just what 
constitutes Apiol As a matter of fact, there 
are several widely differing products mar- 
keted under this name: First, there is a 
chemically pure parsley camphor, had in 
white, slender crystals — the true Apiol that, 
from the clumsy manner in which it is ex- 
tracted, has heretofore been beyond the reach 
of medical science: Second, the essential oil 
of parsley — which is very largely sold: Third, 
an oleo-resin extremely rich in fatty acids, 
woody fibre, cellulose, chlorophyll, etc., with 
a very minute percentage of true parsley cam- 
phor — one to three per cent. — which mani- 
festly renders it devoid of therapeutic value. 
Finally, there is a preparation that purports 
to be the "active principle of Apiol" by vir- 
tue of the terminal hie, and that professedly 
is exhausted from parsley seed with light 
petroleum ether. The manufacturer of this 
preparation, which is of a proprietary charac- 
ter, declares that "the resultant liquid ob- 
tained on distillation leaves a semi-coagulated 
residue of neutral substance, fatty acids, etc., 
partially soluble in alcohol; this latter on 



evaporation yields a product which on the 

addition of caustic soda develops a thick 
reddish liquid, (chemically speaking) pseudo- 
apiic alcohol.*' 

The facts are, however, that the pro* 

just outlined yields neither Apiol or any ac- 
tive principle; hence it is apparent all the 
verbiage is employed merely to mislead and 
to give apparent legitimacy to a proprietary 
solution holding in suspension a modicum of 
true Apiol, and oxydi/.ed (made red) by the 
action of sulphuric acid. 

After several years of experimentation, 
\J essrs. Parke, I )avis &amp; ( \o. have recently been 
able to formulate a process whereby////^ Apiol 
or parsley camphor is segregated at moderate 



expense; this camphor is in the form of white, 
silky, needle-like crystals, that melt at a com- 
paratively low temperature. To overcome 
the commercial disadvantages of a melting- 
point which renders the product liable to 
frequent variations in form and appearance, 
Apiol is now by this firm prepared as a solu- 
tion, seventy-five per cent, of which is pure 
parsley camphor. Thus the chlorophyll, the 
fatty acids, the cellulose, etc., are got rid of, 
and the preparation becomes stable in all 
climates; it is, moreover, double the strength 
of the French proprietary preparation, and 
twenty times the strength of the best "Apiol 1 
marketed as a straw- or chlorophyll-tinted 
fluid. A special advantage of this prepara- 
tion is that its strength may be readily deter- 
mined by any physician or chemist, merely 
by subjecting a quantity to a low degree of 
temperature, when the Apiol crystallizes OUffl 

In other columns of the present issue of 
The Medical Age will be found papers re- 
lating to the therapeutic employment of Apiol; 
and among the maladies for which it has been 
especially recommended in the United States, 
Great Britain, and France — aside from mala- 
ria, amenorrhcea, and dysmenorrhcea — are 
inflammation of the genito-urinary tract, 
renal maladies, and more especially cystitis. 

Generally regarded — and with good reason 
— as a specific remedy for functional 
menorrhcea and amenorrhcea, it possesses 
one especial advantage, viz., that it may be 
administered for the relief of cystic and renal 
maladies in pregnant women. Its tendency 
is to repress rather than promote abortion, 
and consequently it becomes a safe test in a

certain class of cases that are especially apt 
to seek at the hands of medical men relief 
involving a criminal operation. 

The ease and comfort derived by the gen- 
tler sex from the use of Apiol in conditions 
where it is demanded are beyond measure. 
It is more certain in its effects, and more suc- 
cessful in the relief afforded from the tortures 
of painful menstruation, than any agent or 
combination of agents hitherto known to the 
materia medica. 



A NEW AND WONDERFUL FERMENT. 

A highly interesting clipping from the 
editorial columns of The Lancet (London) 
appeared in The Medical Age for June 
25th, describing the newly discovered fer- 
ment Taka-Diastase; and it is evident, if but 
a tithe of the claims made for this product 
are substantiated, there has been secured a 
starch-digesting enzyme of marvellous po- 
tency. 

Scarcely less wonderful than its apparent 
and remarkable amylolytic properties, is the 
history of the discovery and details of the 
systematic investigations which finally re- 
sulted in securing to therapeutics the remedy 
that promises such brilliant results. For all 
this, science is indebted to an Oriental chem- 
ist, Mr. Jokichi Takamine, who, while a stu- 
dent at Glasgow, Scotland, was led to ponder 
over the primitive, costly and tedious meth- 
ods by which the processes of malting are 
carried out, and on his return to Japan seized 
the opportunity to enter upon a searching 
examination of the different varieties of mi- 
croscopic fungi or mould-growths, with the 
view of securing an agent that should not 
only transform the starch of cereals into 
sugar, but likewise convert the latter into 
alcohol. Thus the ferments known to Occi- 
dent and Orient alike were passed in review 
and experimented upon; even the ergots of 
rye and maize, various bacterial germs, and 
the multitude of fungi, came under his scru- 
tiny — all without avail. But when attention 
was turned to Eurotium oryzce. — a fungus 
known also as the Aspergillus oryzce — aston- 
ishing results followed and the labors so 
eagerly pursued stood crowned with success. 

Experiments in cultivating the Aspergillus 



proved wheat bran to be the best medium 
for its growth; here it not only rapidly ma- 
tures, but reproduces its own seed. In the 
commercial process, maturing is not permit- 
ted to proceed to fertilization, but is checked 
at a point where the ferment attains its high- 
est activity; and the resulting product, termed 
"Taka Koji," combines in itself a highly 
potent diastase with a powerful generator of 
alcohol-fermentation. From this latter, at 
the proper stage, the diastase may be separ- 
ated by washing, it being freely soluble in 
water. 

When it is considered that this diastase is 
the most powerful of all the digestive fer- 
ments, the most direct in action, and more- 
over capable of transforming one hundred 
times its weight of dry starch into sugar, its 
therapeutic possibilities are at once apparent. 
It is more than probable that the majority of 
cases of chronic indigestion, dyspeptic con- 
stipation, and dyspeptic diarrhoea, arise from 
a sluggish condition of the prima vice — a 
sluggishness that may be born either of over- 
indulgence in amylaceous food, of sedentary 
habits, organic inactivity, or general lack of 
intestinal tone. In the past no truly starch- 
digesting ferment has been available, those 
heralded as such possessing but feeble power 
and being, moreover, objectionable because 
of their association with substances liable to 
aggravate already existing morbid conditions. 
Taka-Diastase, however, being a pure, iso- 
lated ferment devoid of all admixture, is 
stable, pleasant to take, and promises — if 
half of what is claimed for it is true — to ren- 
der almost magical service in a wide category 
of cases that up to the present have remained 
unamenable to direct treatment. From the 
experiments that have already been made, 
moreover, it would appear that it exerts a 
wonderful influence in assisting assimilation 
by stimulating secretion, completing imper- 
fect digestion, and securing the full value of 
ingested food which under uncorrected path- 
ological conditions is oftentimes as much a 
source of irritation and distress as of renewed 
vitality. 

Certainly the value of this ferment is not 
lessened by the fact that, far from being a 
casual discovery, it is the reward of pro- 
tracted, delicate, and intelligent experimen- 
tation.

Imperfectly ui that anything in connection

from the animal's paws or teeth; but it i^ Btal 

that ther&lt; lion of the skin, and that the 

tleman thought nothing of the matter. The 
dog in the meanwhile was noticed to be out of 
sorts; and as Leeds has been of late suffering from 
a supposed epidemic of rallies, it was deemed pru- 
dent to have the animal destroyed. There was a 
post-mortem examination of it, but no symptoms 
whatever of rabies were discovered. A little later 
the same gentleman injured his hand with glass, 
getting a nasty jagged wound which proved trouble- 
some and difficult to heal. He never actually re- 
covered thoroughly from this hurt; and as time 
went on, symptoms declared themselves of a nature 
recognized by the medical men who attended him 
as identified with hydrophobia. The unfortunate 
gentleman labored in his breathing, could not 
low, and eventually died in the infirmary, 
after much suffering. The cause of his death was 
put down to hydrophobia; and the coroner's jury 
returned a verdict to that effect. It must appear 
strange, nevertheless, that a mere scratch from a 
dog, who after death was found to exhibit no symp- 
toms of rabies, should have been the origin of this 
fatality. Glass and tetanus seem to be more rea- 
sonable causes. 

This evidence of common sense on the 
part of a lay newspaper stands out in strong 
and refreshing contrast to the utterances of 
The Lancet (London), which after editorially 
declaring that "rabies in dugs still prevails 
in its old haunts in Lancashire and Yorkshire, 
though it is present in other parts of England 
and also in Ireland," reports the same case 
seriously as one of "hydrophobia," and uses 
it as the text for a screed having for its bur- 
den wholesale canine murder. 

A remarkable fact in connection with the 
foregoing is the attempt to rehabilitate 
truth the oft-exposed falsehood that in por- 
tions of England rabies is perpetually and 
endemically running not,' with frequent 
spasms of epidemic character — this in face of 
the fact that for years any attempt to pro- 
duce a genuine case of hydrophobia either in 



animal or man has met with failure. During 

ears the British Hydrophobia

Die to discover, throughout the '.&lt; 
and breadth of the land, even one rabid dog

When medical journals foster such id

tically of matters of which they 
festly utterly ignorant, who can blatn&lt; 
untutored general public for its wild S] 
of fear and subsequent eager credence . 
to the claims of every nostrum -monger ? 
Again, when scares are fostered and a 
tised by the leading medical jour: 
world, it is a pertinent query if a miss 
to teach civilization would not find his 
opportunities in and about Regent Street and

TREATHENT OF THE MORPHINE HABIT. 

Doctor H. Macnaughton Jones summarizes 
the different methods of treating the habit as 
follows: 

"The method of Lewenstein— the abrupt 
suppression or sudden stoppage of the drug; 
this has been found dangerous and not to 
answer: 

"The plan of Erlenmeyer — gradual sup- 
pression, or gradually reducing the doses of 
morphine, and extending this over some time: 

" The medium course of moderate suppres- 
sion, or stopping morphine gradually in the 
course of some eight or ten days— this plan 
may be carried out by the aid of hypnotics: 

"Alcohol as a substitute for morphine— this 
is usually a failure: 

"Substitution of chloral for morphine — this 
is also a failure: 

"Substitution of opium and other of its al- 
kaloids — likewise a failure: 

bstitution of nitroglycerin and other 
drugs for morphine — also a failure: 

"The best plan is the treatment by sup- 
ion combined with other judicious 
ment, by control, diet, and the use of hyp- 
notics. ' The substitution of water in the 
solution of morphine is not without danger. 
When discovered it is apt to excite indigna- 
tion on the part of the patient, who wdl re- 
fuse to be again guided by the physician, 
and thereby the last state may become worse 
than the first; suicide has followed several 
such instances."

The risk attending the use of morphine in 
the treatment of affections of the pelvic or- 
gans in women is often not sufficiently recog- 
nized. The influence of temperament should 
be carefully considered in its administration, 
the hysterical and neurotic being especially 
susceptible to intoxication by the drug — 
in such cases morphine should be used only 
as a dernier ressort, and rarely if ever for the 
relief of what may be termed suggestive pain. 
This is true of many cases of ovarian neural- 
gia and reflex ovarian pains; also in those 
reflex spinal pains arising out of real or func- 
tional disorders of the generative organs of 
women, or in the insomnia arising from the 
same cause. 

The use of morphine during the climacteric 
is particularly dangerous. 

The risk of morphine intoxication should 
be guarded against as far as possible by the 
medical man himself (save under very excep- 
tional circumstances) administering the injec- 
tions. Only the quantity of solution for a 
limited number of injections should be pre- 
scribed at one time, and the prescription 
should for safety's sake be marked not to be 
again compounded unless re-initialed and 
dated; prescriptions for hypodermatic injec- 
tions of morphine should not be given into 
the patient's hands. All patients and their 
friends should be warned against the danger 
of repeated administrations of morphine. 



EDITORIAL NOTES. 



Death of a Notable Illegitimate. 

Prince Wilhelm Albrecht, of Montenuovo, 
who recently died in Krafft-Ebing's private 
lunatic asylum near Vienna, was the illegiti- 
mate son of Maria Louisa — second wife of 
Napoleon I. — by the ugly one-eyed Field 
Marshal Count von Neipperg. It was be- 
cause of his extremely ill-favored appear- 
ance that the latter was selected nominally 
as ''High Chamberlain" and "Chief Officer 
of the Household" of the ex-Empress of the 
French, but really as a guardian and to pre- 
vent scandal, since the virtue of the daugh- 
ter of the Austrian Kaiser was not like that 
of Caesar's wife. But even an ogre could not 
smother the passions of Louisa. She gave 
birth to Wilhelm Albrecht a year before Na- 
poleon's demise. Though Von Neipperg 



married his royal concubine a fortnight after 
the news was received of the latter event, 
being compelled thereto by His Apostolic 
Austrian Majesty, the product of the ante- 
marital liaison could not well be legitimized. 
Neither would the Von Xeippergs allow Wil- 
helm to bear their name, whereupon his im- 
perial grandfather bestowed upon him that of 
Montenuovo — which is simply the rendering 
of Von Neipperg into Italian — and ultimately 
raised him to the rank of Prince. 

Josephine was an unfaithful wife, but when 
the great Napoleon espoused an Austrian 
grand duchess, so far as securing morality 
was concerned, he "jumped from the frying- 
pan into the fire." 

Bogus Degrees.— 

" Adept" writes to the Chemist and Drug- 
gist, wondering why so few of the dental 
practitioners of Great Britain who were regis- 
tered before the passing of the Dental Act 
have made an effort to obtain a diploma or 
degree in the States. He seems to believe 
dental degrees are to be had on this side of 
the Atlantic merely for the asking. 

Two letters recently reached the editor of 
The Medical Age, one from British Colum- 
bia and one from Great Britain, asking "as 
a favor" where a medical degree could " be 
had in absentia." 

If the reputation abroad of American med- 
ical education is so low as this, it certainly is 
time some steps were taken for the repression 
of bogus institutions. To be sure, all med- 
ical colleges deny the selling of diplomas, 
yet that certain institutions do sub rosa prac- 
tically dispose of their " sheepskins " for cash 
is known to be a fact in localities more or 
less remote from their native heath. 

Benefits and Evils of Morphine. — 

Almost the last words of the late Doctor 
Hack Tuke, according to Doctor Macnaugh- 
ton Jones, were: 

If all the benefits which have resulted from the 
use of morphine were balanced against the mis- 
chief which has followed its abuse, I doubt if the 
latter would not largely outweigh the former. 

Doctor Jones believes that the clandestine 
use of morphine is on the increase, and he 
emphasizes the fact that it is the subcutane- 
ous injection of the alkaloid which is specially 
dangerous.

Items and News, 



The Hypodermatic Syringe.— 

It is whether the invention of 

the hypodermatic syringe has been a boon or 

a bane to humanity. Undoubtedly it has 

Of actually saving life in I . 

of g renal and biliary rolic, 

but even in such cases its use ought to be re- 
stricted. It is a remarkable fact that a suc- 
SSful means of breaking morphine-takers of 
their habit is based upon the much greater 
facility with which the drug can be with- 
drawn when taken by the mouth than when 
it is administered by the syringe. Indeed, 
in medical practice the hypodermatic syringe 
should be reserved for cases of great agony 
requiring immediate relief; a long course of 
opium, when necessary, should be given in 
other ways. Finally, it is almost criminal to 
entrust the patient with a syringe for the safe 
administration of morphine. —Doc tor C. A. 
Mercier, before the British (iynaecological 
Society. 

Are You Guilty? 

The medical man is positively helpless 
without pure drugs. To comprehend a path- 
ological condition, to recognize the remedy, 
is not enough. He must see that the chosen 
drug actually performs the work assigned to 
it, and this it will not do unless it is a pure 
and active preparation. 

The doctor must look out for the quality 
of his drugs. There is no doubt whatever 
that the annual death rate from disease could 
be greatly decreased by proper attention on 
the part of the physician to this very essen- 
tial point. He must compel the druggist to 
be honest, by unceasing watchfulness. He 
must recognize that poor drugs and substitu- 
tion exercise as much influence as " the hand 
of Providence" in filling up our cemeteries. 
—Brief. 

Hedical Progress.— 

A writer in Borderland, speaking of the gen- 
eral drift and progress of medical thought, 
says "that in the evolution in the art of heal- 
ing we seem to be on the eve of three great 
changes. The first is the recognition of the 
virtue of the greatly reduced but more fre- 
quently administered doses; the second is 
the recognition of the value of the vegetable 
as compared with the mineral drug; and the 
third is the recognition of the value of those 
subtle curative agencies supplied by the 
animal world, as seen in magnetism, in hyp- 
notism, and in those phenomena which show 
the influence of mind over matter." — Brief. 



An Unusual Case.— 

A Brooklyn dry-goods merchant and athj 
l:ed in hospital from an operation for 
the purpose of removing a human mole. 
Two months before hi iken ill; 

plained of sharp pains in the sides and 
An operation disclosed th&lt; ice in his 

side, solidly imbedded in the . of a 

mole Child, eight inches in length and 
fectly formed. The child was an em . 
twin, which had remained in its brother's 
side from birth. Death was due to blood- 
poisoning.— A ' lyclinic. 



Anent the Tablet Craze.— 






Doctor John V. Shoemaker is not a believer 
in compressed-tablet medication. Enthusi- 
astic advocates of the use of tablets, he says, , 
seem disposed to trust to them too exclu- 
sively on account of convenience in dispens- 
ing, and portability, which makes them ac- 
ceptable to the physician and to many pa- 
tients. But the best results are to be had 
from a skillful adaptation of different forms 
of medicine in different conditions and ac- 
cording to the exigencies of each case. — 
Western Druggist. 

Medical Ethics and Medical Science. — 

These cannot be separated. If quackery 
and charlatanism and self-seeking are allowed 
to become dominant in medical associations, 
and to win the rewards of honor which should 
be bestowed upon opposite qualities, those 
who enter the ranks of the profession will be 
encouraged to pursue the wrong and deterred 
from following the right. Under such cir- 
cumstances greed and untruth must come to 
the front, and science cannot flourish where 
this is possible. — Philadelphia Polyclinic. 

What Does it Mean?— 

The second International Convention of 
Scientists recently convened in Chicago. 
Several hundred men and women were in at- 
tendance, embracing mental healers, truth- 
seekers, Christian scientists and scientists of 
the divine, mental and spiritual orders, the 
Association being liberal in its membership. 
The cardinal principle of belief upon which 
the Association is founded is that "The ex- 
pression of subjective unity is objective har- 
mony. " — ? 

A Gruesome Discovery. — 

According to the New York Times, an in- 
vestigation of the cause of the prevalence of 
contagious diseases in the schools of New 
York City has disclosed the fact that out of

ii2 school trustees twenty per cent, are un- 
dertakers — a fact which the Times says 
"would be amusing were it not so tragical." 

Examination of Infants.— 

In every case of labor the physician should 
make it his duty to carefully examine the 
genital organs and anus of the child to see if 
they are normal. A little care at this time 
may save considerable chagrin later, if an 
abnormal condition is discovered by a com- 
peting practitioner. — Homoeopathic News. 

Two Views of Bacteriology.— 

Neuralgia, sick headache, dyspepsia, bil- 
iousness, catarrh of the bowels, jaundice, and 
stone in the bladder, are caused by microbes. 
— Bacteriological Review. 

The moon was probably full and there was 
a black cat on the fence when the discovery 
was made. — Homoeopathic Record. 

Blindness Caused by Male Fern.— 

Recently, to the Medical Society of Buda- 
iPesth (Hungary), Grosz gave account of a 
lease of complete blindness caused in a man 

thirty years old as. the result of administra- 
Ition of male fern and pomegranate; there 
!had previously been some weakness of one 

eye. 

A Suggestion in Vivisection.— 

The Dog Fancier publishes an editorial 
claiming that vivisection should be practiced 
[upon depraved human criminals, and not upon 
1 dumb but innocent creatures. — Our Dumb Ani- 
i mats. 

Non=immunized Serum.— 

Doctor Bertin, of Nantes, has made the 
discovery that non-immunized horse-serum 
is identical with the immunized, and acts in 
the same manner. — Recorder. 

A Deal of Truth.— 

" A physician should give as much study to 
diet and cooking as to physic. It does a 
practitioner no harm to bear the reputation 
of a gourmand." — Niemeyer. 

Beware! — 

The bloom of the peach and the purple of 
the grape are but "a growth of microbes." — 
Exchange. 

What's in a Name?— 

Undertakers have resolved that hereafter 
they must be known as "morticians."

Lydekker, B.A., F.R.S., F.Z.S. Paper; royal 
8vo; pp. 96. Price, 50 cents. Frederick Warne 

1 &amp; Co., New York. 

This is No. 1 of Volume I of Warne's Li- 
brary of Natural History, which will be 
completed in thirty-six parts, published fort- 
lightly, at the extremely low price of $11 
i)er annum. This first issue appears with a 
nagnificent chromo frontispiece of a lion 
hnd lioness, while midway in its pages is a 
'.econd plate of like character representing a 
proup of five baboons — plates that are cer- 
ainly works of art. 

The first chapter appears with a very thor- 
ough, complete, but concise description of 
;he characteristics of Mammals, which em- 
)races their osteology, odontology, etc. 
\ Chapter Two deals with the order Primates 
—apes, monkeys, and lemurs, the peculiari- 
ies of which are described and compared, 
ind further elucidated by means of plates — 



the Stmiadce are thus conclusively shown to 
belong to the class Bimana. The portraits of 
the chimpanzee are of a more than ordinary 
degree of excellence, and are unmistakably 
from life. Next is a very complete history 
of the gorilla, in which are discussed his 
characteristics, relationship to man, structure, 
color, geographical distribution, mode of life 
both free and in captivity; this too is illus- 
trated by a very interesting series of portraits 
of the young gorilla at play. Then follows 
the orang-utan, which is dealt with in an 
equally comprehensive manner with illustra- 
tions from life. Young orangs and gibbons 
are compared by means of a full-sized plate. 
The chapter is completed by a description of 
the gibbons and their fossil relatives. 

Chapter Three deals with Old World mon- 
keys and baboons — with seven species of 
langurs, the crested lutong, douc, and gureza; 
banded-leaf, negro, purple-faced, dusky-leaf, 
proboscis, black, ursine, white-thighed, and 
king monkeys; and bay and crested colobs. 

Chapter Four describes the guenons, the 
talopoin monkey, and malbrouck. 

This work, which has already been re- 
viewed abroad, is declared by Mr. W. Tegte- 
mire, the Curator of the Zoological Gardens 
of London, to be the most complete and 
authentic ever published — in which estimate 
we heartily concur. Further, it has received 
the most hearty indorsement of all the promi- 
nent naturalists on both sides of the Atlantic. 



The Emigrant Ship. By W. Clark Russell. Paper; 
i2mo; pp. 34S. Price, 50 cents. The Cassell 
Publishing Co., New York. 

This is one of the many thrilling works 
from the pen of this well known author, and 
is in his very best strain. There is more 
plot than is usual with Mr. Russell's sea 
stories, and we find the hero starting out 
with an evil captain and dishonest owner 
who desire to wreck the ship for its insur- 
ance, and subsequently gotten rid of by being 
thrown by the latter over a cliff on those 
barren rocks — they can hardly be called 
islands — known as The Salvages. Next he 
is rescued by a barque under the command 
of an old shipmate, from which vessel he is 
kidnapped into a ship that has lost its offi- 
cers and is carrying women emigrants to 
Australia. Here he is confronted with a 
crew who desire to sail the ship to a South 
Sea island and form a settlement after the 
manner of the historic crew of the Bounty, 
though without resort to illegal measures. 
Finally the hero, having disposed of the crew 
and certain of the women on an island in the 
mid-south Pacific, navigates his ship to Syd- 
ney with a female crew. The sea descrip-

ilsbam, M.H.. CM., F.R.C.S., and William 

Kent Hughes, M B., M.R.C S . L.R.C.P. Cloth; 

William York. 

This is the only complete and pra&lt; 
work vith deformities of the human 

which has appeared since tin- m 
volume of Harwell a quarter of a century 
. and is by well known London ortho- 
sts, A notable feature is the pathology, 
illustrations being directly from dissections 
and casts, and in consequence more light is 
thrown upon the subject of talipes and kin- 
dred deformities than has ever been possible 
before: even the pathology of each individual 
bone in any one deformity is carefully worked 
out. 

The work is especially to be commended 
from the fact that it treats of deformities 
from the standpoint of the general surgeon 
rather than that of the specialist; further, it 
is concise, practical, and couched in language 
that is always intelligible. 



The Library Catalogue. Cloth; Svo; pp. 300. 
Price, $t.5«. Lee &amp; Shepard, Boston. 

Owners of libraries will find this a great 
desideratum— a blank book of convenient 
size, ruled, with printed headings giving 
columns for title, shelf, or mark, author, size, 
date, number of pages, publisher, etc., of 
each book. A few pages are added at the 
end whereby may be registered books loaned. 

If there were no other advantages, the cost 
and trouble of the catalogue would be fully 
compensated in the avoidance of the loss and 
destruction of many valuable works, of which 
every one complains as the ill-deserved but 
too common consequence of kindness in 
loaning books. By the arrangement of this 
catalogue any book desired can be found at 
a glance — and its use will be of great help to 
any book-owner, be his library large or small.

Wilue of Iron Preparations. — The human 
body contains a considerable amount of iron, 
varying from thirty to forty-five grains, which 
is chiefly found in the haemoglobin of the 
blood in the form of proteid compound. 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 



411 



Physicians are in error if they suppose iron 
aken medicinally is applied to the build- 
[ ng up of this compound, for recent ex- 
; )eriments make it extremely probable that 
he inorganic iron preparations are not at all 
ibsorbed. Thus, Hamburger, in experiments 
i ipon animals, was able to collect from the 
. aeces all the iron administered by the mouth. 
Ifhe same result was obtained by Schmiede- 
herg and his pupil, A. Marfori. There is 
&gt;arely a perceptible trace of inorganic iron in 
the urine, and this is not increased by ad- 
ministration. If iron is not excreted by the 
lirine, the only way in which it can leave the 
[economy is by the intestines, and experiments 
l.how that as a matter of fact the body-iron is 
lost in this way — Bidder and Schmidt estab- 
lished this fact by experiments upon starved 
lats, and found ten times as much iron in the 
■ aeces as in the urine. The same results have 
l)een reached by experiments on fasting men. 
Further experiments show that iron is ex- 
creted, not by the stomach or through the 
bile, but by the intestines. Voit, Marfori 
lind Hamburger alike have shown that inor- 
ranic compounds of iron are not absorbed in 
Ln appreciable amount by the alimentary 
Bract. It is impossible, therefore, to resist 
[he conclusion that only in some peculiar or- 
ganic form are ferruginous salts taken up to 
&lt;nake haemoglobin. 

I am strongly inclined to disbelieve in the 
feal value of iron preparations. Iron that is 
[ibsorbed is not necessarily assimilated, while, 
|&gt;n the other hand, in about ten days the or- 
dinary food will convey to the organism iron 
hqual to one-third that in the blood. In 
pther words, the food contains always enough 
iron to supply the needs even of the very 
Jinaemic. The apparent utility of iron in thera- 
&gt;eutics appears to be largely a matter of sug- 
gestion. — Professor Bunge, before the Ger- 
man Congress of Internal Medicine. 



11 Mental Disturbance from Iodoform." — A 
emale patient, aged fifty-one, who had suf- 
ered from epileptic attacks from the age of 
wenty, but in the intervals had been quite 
iealthy and not physically peculiar, injured 
ler head in a lit, and was treated with a ten- 
&gt;er-cent. iodoform ointment. Twelve days 
later she became excitable, restless, and con- 
used, and by-and-by had hallucinations. The 
urine gave a distinct iodine reaction. When 
idmitted to a hospital she talked incessantly, 
•vould not answer questions, could scarcely 
»)e kept in bed, and complained of plots and 
Persecution. The restlessness increased, and 
;he became cyanotic; the urine contained 
'ilbumen, but gave a very slight iodine reac- 



tion. She then remained quiet for a few 
days, but again became demented, after which 
she had another period of quietude followed 
by another outbreak, which, however, sub- 
sided, so that she was then able to be dis- 
charged. The condition could not be re- 
garded as a post-epileptic mental disturbance, 
because of the interval that elapsed between 
the last attack and the onset of mental symp 
toms. Manifestly it was determined by the 
iodoform poisoning acting upon a nervous 
system predisposed by epilepsy to grave dis- 
turbance. — Doctor Oldenberg, in Neurolo- 
gisches Centralblatt. 



Horse Nettle in Epilepsy. — Patient, a young 
man, twenty years of age; very large and 
strong; always lived on a farm; given to no 
vices; had epilepsy several months, the at- 
tacks occurring at intervals of about three 
weeks, usually in the early morning, at three 
or four o'clock, but sometimes in daytime, 
at the table, or while at his work in the fields; 
they were genuine epileptic seizures. After 
some other remedies, he began taking Sola- 
num carolinense in ten-drop doses. In about 
three weeks he had a hard convulsion. The 
dose was increased to fifteen drops, then to 
twenty, twenty-five, and finally thirty drops 
three times a day. There has been no con- 
vulsion since September 23d, 1893. He has 
taken the medicine regularly, during the last 
six months twice a day, and has had two 
vacations of two weeks each. It may not 
have been the Solanum carolinense that inter- 
rupted the attacks, but if not the coincidence 
is a strange one. I am inclined to the belief 
that fairly large doses are more likely to be 
of use, and have had no complaint of any 
disagreeable effects. I have used it in sev- 
eral cases, but not in any where I felt as pos- 
itive of the correctness of my diagnosis, and 
at the same time had so obedient and faith- 
ful a patient. — Doctor E. C. Carr, in Ther- 
apeutic Gazette. 



Vaccination. — Doctor Ortega, who practices 
medicine on the frontier of Mexico, states 
that he has observed that most of the North 
American people are vaccinated by the scrap- 
ing process, and that a great number of them, 
although bearing a large and deforming cica- 
trix, contract smallpox, or can be successfully 
vaccinated by puncture. On the contrary, 
among those vaccinated by puncture very 
few suffer from the contagion, while revac- 
cination succeeds in only' a few cases. 

As these observations were made on both 
Mexicans and Americans, the author con- 
cludes that the race has no influence on re-

Obstruction of Bowel. — A man, fifty-four 

I, for three months had obstinate 

pation. Finally the bowels did not 

move for ten days: the abdomen was dis- 
tended and tender; the appetite lost; and a 
condition of collapse existed, with sunken 
nail, feeble pulse. The intro- 
duction of a long tube proved unavailing. 
An insulated sound, with a free metallic end, 
was introduced into the rectum, and a moist- 
ened conductor applied to the abdominal 
parietes, chietly in the region of the sigmoid 
flexure. Through this circuit a primary Far- 
adic current was passed, and its force gradu- 
ally increased until the patient experienced a 
decided feeling of vibration in the bowel. In 
the course of the day a copious intestinal 
evacuation ensued, with wonderful relief to 
all of the symptoms. During the next two 
days the bowels acted ten times, and in the 
course of a week the patient appeared to be 
quite well. A like result was obtained in a 
second case, a woman fifty-seven years old. —

:(h under Nitrous Oxide, Due to Tight 
Latin/.— More than one fatality from tight 
lacing has recently been noticed in these 
columns. In all conditions in which free 
respiration becomes a necessity if the vital 
processes are to be carried on, tight lacing 
means death. Of all states, that in which a 
patient takes an anaesthetic is the one when 
absolute freedom of breathing is a necessity. 
Unhappily but few know this elementary 
fact in physiology, and hence the sad death 
of a girl who had taken nitrous oxide gas at 
a dentist's rooms, and while recovering from 
its influence had a fatal attack of syncope. 
The statement is made that her stays were 
five inches too small for her natural body — a 
disparity of shape 'which, we imagine, the 
dentist might have seen and acted upon be- 
fore he ventured to give the unfortunate girl 
nitrous oxide gas. — The Lancet (London).

Toxicity of Thyroid — Basedow's Disease. 
Beclere presented to the Medical Society

took a large quantity of thyroid gland— &lt; 
grains in eleven days At the end of tl 
time she had developed such symptoms 
tachycardia, pyrexia, insomnia, tremor of tl 
extremities, exophthalmia, polyuria, albumin- 
uria, and glycosuria — in fact, a complete pic- 
ture of Basedow's disease. The writer, there-i

to a hypersecretion of the thyroid gland, 
which may be caused in more ways than one.

ervousness; gave him Passiflora, twenty-five 
lirops in a teaspoonful of water, every twenty 
linutes; three doses completely controlled 
is nerves and prevented a spell of epileptic 
ts. This was on December 24th, 1894, and 
ince that time, whenever he feels that the 
&gt; fits " are coming on, I give him tincture 
'assiflora, thirty drops in a little water, re- 
peating the dose in twenty minutes. Sixty

of weakness, and other reflex symptoms of 
these cases. In bronchitis, asthma, dyspnoea,

Diarrhoea in Fowls. — Diarrhoea is often 
caused by the drinking-water being left in

condition. If promptly attended to, a case 
may generally be cured by feeding with a 
little boiled rice sprinkled with prepared 
chalk. If there appears a tendency among 
the birds in the pen to contract diarrhoea, a 
few drops of tincture of iron should be put 
in the drinking-water in addition to giving 
the rice and chalk. — Agricultural Gazette y

ginning with six-minim doses, but gradually 
increasing to ten minims. With the third in-

1-'ai.i icy oi Early Rising. — Proverbs ar 
responsible for a great deal of folly, am 
none perhaps for more mischief under th 
present conditions of life than those whi 
inculcate early rising as a virtue. When th 
great majority lived in villages, and wen 
engaged in the cultivation of the soil, earl; 
rising may have been conducive to heal 
and wealth, if not to wisdom, but even o 
early forefathers probably did no more thi 
make a virtue of necessity. It is said to 
natural — that is, physiological — to rise ea 
and enjoy the beauties of the sunrise; if 
ask why, we are treated to various transc 
dental theories about the vivifying influe 
of the sun, and are told to take example 
the birds of the air and the beasts of 
field, or so many of them as are not noctur 
in their habits. But as a matter of fact, ph 
iology, so far as it has anything to say on t 
subject at all, is all against the early-risii 
theory. Physiological experiment app 
to show that a man does not work best 
fastest in the early morning hours, but, 
the contrary, about mid-day. The desire 
rise early, except in those trained from you 
to outdoor pursuits, is commonly a sign, 
of strength of character and vigor of b 
but of advancing age. The very old of 
sleep much, but they do not sleep long. 
long, deep sleep, the sleep of youth, requin 
for its production a thoroughly elastic 
lar system. The stiffening vessels of age 
not so completely nor so easily controlled 
the vaso-motor nerves; hence shorter - 
Thus, paterfamilias, who goes to bed at I 
p.m., wants to get. up at 5 or 6 a.m., and la 
upon his healthy son, who prefers to lie till 
as a sluggard. When this foolish interpret* 
tion of a proverb about the health and wealt 
to be got from early rising is combined witbj 
the still more foolish adage which says of 
sleep, "Six hours for a man, seven for

roman, and eight for a fool," then we have a 
icious system capable of working great mis- 
hief to the young people of both sexes, 
"here is a tendency, greatly encouraged in 
owns by the spread of cycling, to curtail 
nduly the hours of sleep. Parties of young 
len and lads are to be met careering about 
le streets at midnight. They wo'uld be far 
etter in bed. They have probably to be in 
leir offices or shops by 9 a.m., or even ear- 
er, and when time is deducted for supper, 
pilet, breakfast, and the journey to the place 
f business, it is evident that the hours for 
eep cannot exceed six, or at most seven, 
'hese young men are no doubt encouraged 
y the silly adage quoted above. There is a 
isposition in town youths to overdo outdoor 
ixercise; the cycling club "night spins" are 
istances in point. As Nordau has said, with 
great deal of truth, the town-dweller of 
inese last decades of the nineteenth century 
iiffers from nervous fatigue, and is so ill ad- 
vised as to make his very recreations sources, 
jot of recuperation, but of increased exhaus- 
on. If our forefathers were early risers,

S Revelations of Chemistry in the Body. 
'-The mysterious influence of mind over body 
is given rise to a new department in medi- 
t'ne, and but recently scientific experiments 
ive been made in order to investigate what 
I called the psycho-physical, or in simpler 
.nguage the soul-physical, phenomena. 
I For instance, two kinds of perspiration are 
ow recognized. Exercise gives an absolutely 
palthy moisture to the body; but the sud- 
tn, cold perspiration of a person suffering 
ifom a sense of guilt has its own chemical 
roperties A little of this brought in con- 
».ct with selenic acid produces a pink color, 
hich cannot be obtained from the perspira- 
pn caused by any other emotion. 
: Some time ago, in a fit of rage, one boy 
It another. The wound soon became dan- 
t.'jrous and showed signs of acute poisoning 
^'-like rabies. The child's life was barely 
jived. It has been discovered that anger 
fianges the chemical properties of the saliva, 
I that it becomes a poison dangerous to life. 
I It is well known that the mother's intense 
• iger or grief will change her life-giving milk 
to a virulent poison. Surprise has caused 
•:ath and madness. Emotion, therefore, is 
♦ther stimulating or depressing. It gives 
ie or takes it away. Worry, fret, discon- 
1nt, unhappiness, dishonor, anger, petulance, 
&lt;ch produces a definite effect upon the sys- 



tem, that acts deleteriously like a poison, and 
exhausts the body. This is as active in its 
own way as prussic acid, and may be chem- 
ically recognized. 

Professor James of Harvard, an eminent 
authority in the mental sciences, says: " Every 
small stroke of virtue or vice leaves its never 
so little scar. Nothing that we ever do is in 
strict literalness wiped out." 

As every sinful indulgence makes its own 
poison that depresses the system, so " every 
good emotion," the physiologist assures us, 
" makes a life-promoting change." Goodness, 
cheerfulness, kindness, contentment, have 
their corresponding physical value and act as 
antidotes to poisonous irritants, and so give 
strength. 

There are other ways of ruining the body 
besides getting drunk, yielding to vulgar 
indulgences, or acquiring the fast-increasing 
cigarette cancers. A half-hour's fit of hatred, 
or anger, or uncontrollable grief may under- 
mine the constitution, and has caused death. 
Anxiety, envy, discontent, unchristian ambi- 
tion, may be the subtle poison which the 
physician tries in vain to eradicate from the 
ailing body. 

The great Hebrew seer, whose writings are 
becoming better appreciated as time goes on, 
anticipated a wonderful chemistry when he 
said: "As righteousness tendeth to life, so 
he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own 
death." — Youth's Companion. 



The Simulation of Death by Faquirs. 
— Herr Kuhn not long ago presented a com- 
munication on this subject to the Anthropo- 
logical Society of Munich. He had the op- 
portunity of personally observing two cases, 
as to the genuineness of which he had no 
doubt whatever. One of the faquirs referred 
to had been buried alive for six weeks, the 
other for ten days. The condition which the 
faquir has the power of producing artificially 
is in all respects identical with the cataleptic 
trance. The faquirs, who are all hysterical 
subjects of a very pronounced type, put them- 
selves through a regular course of training 
before the performance, weakening them- 
selves by semi-starvation, taking internally 
various vegetable substances known only to 
themselves, keeping their bodies motionless 
in the same position for several hours at a 
time, etc. The details of this preparation are 
given in the Hathayoga Pradipika Strditmd- 
rdmas, which has been translated by Walter. 
When the faquir has by these means got him- 
self into the proper condition, he has only to 
lie down in one of the positions enjoined by 
the sacred books, and fix his eyes on the end

almost unnoticeable by massage and the use 
of certain ointments. The most important 
point, of course, is to make the diagnosis be-

what is imaginary. Such growths are gener- 
ally the result of a defective mammary de- 
velopment and are caused by tight lacing. 

Besides massage and loosening of the cor- 
set, an ointment of iodide of lead and in 
some ca&gt;es the administration of bromide of

ance of the tumor. It is just here that un- 
scrupulous operators remove the tumor, or 
perhaps the breast, in order to get the credit 
of curing a cancer. — Maryland Medical Jour-

of the birth of six children at one birth, 
which is said by Von Herf (Fortshritte der 
Medicin) to be the first well-authenticated 
case on record. The patient, thirty-six years 
of age, during the early months of her preg-

useless. The specimen is preserved in the 
museum of the Obstetrical School at Milan.

Shock in Castration. — That severing the 
cord in excision of the testicle produces any 
shock to the system, has been recently de- 
nied, but I would like to add an account of 
recent observation made while administerin 
ether to a patient undergoing double castra 
tion. The left cord was first clamped, then 
severed; at the placing of the clamp nothing 
was noticed, but at the moment the cord was 
cut the radial pulse, which up to that time 
had been regular, stopped, missed two beats 
and then proceeded as before. A little later 
the cord upon the right side was clamped, 
and a well marked convulsive movement ol 
the right arm and side was noticed. At the 
moment the right cord was severed the radia 
pulse stopped, missed five beats, Muttered foi 
a few seconds, and then became regular as 
before. — Doctor W. O. Hermance, in Phil

ing at an early and correct diagnosis.—

STUDY OF THE NEWER OPERATIONS 
FOR H/EMORRHOIDS. 

BY EDMUND ANDREWS, A.M., M.D., LL.D. 

Eighteen centuries ago the Roman physi- 
:ian Celsus treated bleeding piles by cauter- 
zing them with hot quicklime and afterwards 
mncturing with a needle, whereby, he says, 
the heads [of the piles] being burned, a 
icatrix is formed, which prevents the out- 
low of blood." Improvement followed. 

More than a hundred years ago Sir Ben- 
amin Bell, of Scotland, discussed the ques- 
ion of ligatures, excision, and actual cautery, 
srhich various writers long before him had 
.dvocated for piles. 

During the last fifteen years many changes 
lave been introduced, not always real im- 
►rovements; and finally organized troops of 
[uacks have appeared, trying to achieve no- 
oriety in this branch of practice. 

Among recent surgeons Mr. Allingham, of 
^ondon, made decided improvements on the 
&gt;ld plan of ligation. Noticing that the chief 
rtery of each pile came down on the upper 
urface, while the nerves of sensation entered 
»n the lower, he seized the pile, drew it up, and, 
nipping its lower border loose, dissected it 
ipward some distance, and finally tied it high 
ip. This prevents haemorrhage, and by sev- 
ring the chief sensory nerves benumbs the 
ensibility and prevents pain. I have been 
tithe habit of either cauterizing the wound 
elow the knot with chromic acid to prevent 
epticism, or closing it with catgut sutures to 
trevent pathogenic microbes from entering 
he submucous connective tissue. 

Professor Merrill Ricketts, of Cincinnati, 
as devised the following improved plan of 
igation: Having disinfected the parts, he 
akes a semicircular needle armed with anti- 
eptic silk, and, inserting it near the lower 



border of the piles, passes it upward between 
the mucous membrane and the sphincter, 
and, encompassing a segment of the enlarged 
veins, brings it out at the same opening, and 
ties it firmly, leaving the ends hangirg out.

showing the interior of the rectum. S S S S, the 
divided sphincter muscles. L L L, theends of the 
ligatures hanging out of the needle punctures. 
The dotted loops show the course of the ligatures 
beneath the mucous membrane. 

He repeats this at regular intervals around 
the gut, so that most of the veins are included 
in the knots. No incisions are made, and the 
operation is wholly submucous. I have not 
tried this plan yet, but think it will be found 
an excellent one. 

Professor Esmarch, of Kiel, Germany, the 
famous inventor of Esmarch's bandage, writes 
me that he seizes each pile and boldly snips 
it off; then ties any spurting arteries; finally 
closes the wounds with catgut ligatures, doing 
the whole with antiseptic precautions. He

Esmarch'a Method of Treating Piles. A B, the 
place from which a pile has been snipped out, 
with the stitches inserted and ready to be tied 
to close the wound. 

An eminent surgeon named Smith, in Lon- 
don, gave special attention to the use of the 
clamp and cautery, and became the chief ad- 
vocate of that method; he was one of the 
three different operators to whom the inven- 
tion of the ordinary pile-clamp is attributed 
— the real inventor, however, was a Dublin 
surgeon. Smith's influence rescued the cau- 
tery from the partial oblivion into which it 
had fallen, and greatly increased its popular- 
ity. The invention of the thermo-cautery 
and the electro-cautery increased the facility 
of applying the heat. 

About fifteen years ago a young physician 
in central Illinois, named Mitchel, conceived 
the idea of destroying piles by injecting into 
them with a hypodermatic syringe a strong 
solution of carbolic acid dissolved in oil. 
This plan was sold out as a secret remedy to 
numerous local and itinerant ''pile doctors" 
all over the country; and hundreds of thou- 
sands of patients received the treatment, and 
in many cases with benefit. When the wave 
of its popularity was at its height, I discov- 
ered the secret in consequence of a quack

observations on the results of t 
treatment in their vicinity; I also wr 
many of the quacks themselves and to a large 
number of true physicians. As a result I 
received about three hundred letters, and 
reports of thirteen deaths from the method, 
and a great number of other incidenl 
was disappointed, for I had hoped the plan 
might prove valuable; but it was th&lt; 
story over again that the injection of c

be temporary. Its popularity declined, but 
many itinerants (now calling them- 
" rectal surgeons") still practice it. 

About ten years ago Mr. Whitehead, 
reputable surgeon of Manchester, England, 
adopted the operation which bears his name 
His plan was to dissect out the whole mucous 
membrane of the anus and lower rectum, 
taking with it the piles and all the hemor- 
rhoidal veins, and also the nerves and most 
of the submucous connective tissue. A ref

erence to Fig. 3 will make the plan clear. 
He makes a circular incision entirely around 
the anus at the junction of the mucous mem- 
brane and the skin, then dissects upward, 
separating the veins, piles and membrane 
ifrom the'inside of the sphincter until he gets 
higher than the piles, leaving the bloody 
mass hanging loose inside the sphincter. 
uNext he cuts off the mass at the top, ties the 
arteries, and removes the whole. The cut 
edge of the mucous membrane above is then 
ipulled down and stitched to the cut edge of 
&gt;the skin below to cover the raw surface and 
(produce a union by first intention. Unfor- 
tunately the stitches often give way and the 
mucous membrane draws up, leaving a gran- 
ulating tubular ulcer, which contracts as it 
Seals and produces a stricture. 

There are other evils. By consulting Fig. 
Il will be seen some of the reasons of their 
Dccurrence.

Tactile Mechanism of the Rectum. M, mucous 
surface of the rectum. H H, the columns of 
Morgagni. P P P, the row of papillae below 
the columns of Morgagni. S S S, Hilton's white 
line, otherwise called the verge of the anus; it 
is marked by the junction of the skin and mu- 
ceus membrane and by the junction of the in- 
ternal with the external sphincter. 

About an inch above the verge of the anus 
;he mucous membrane begins to be like all 



the gut above, nearly destitute of nerves of 
sensation, and worthless as an organ of touch. 

The columns of Morgagni are a circle of 
parallel or rather of converging ridges, small 
and about a third of an inch long. They 
are tactile organs — or at least are sensitive 
to touch. The grooves between them lodge 
a reserve of rectal mucus to lubricate the 
descending faeces. 

The row of small papillae which surround 
the opening just below the columns of Mor- 
gagni are tactile organs of high sensibility. 
Each has an artery and a nerve, at its base a 
little ganglion-like enlargement of the nerve. 
These papillae and the adjacent mucous mem- 
brane just above and below are exceedingly 
sensitive and are the seat of a tactile special 
sense whereby the person is informed of the 
presence and progress of any mass of de- 
scending fasces. It is supposed also that the 
papillary nerves act in a reflex manner to 
excite or control the muscles of retention 
and of defaecation, so that these acts do not 
require a constant exertion of mental atten- 
tion and will force. Hence tjiese papillae are 
very important. 

The line of junction of the internal and ex- 
ternal sphincters, and of the mucous mem- 
brane with the skin, is commonly called 
Hilton's white line. 

Now Whitehead's operation when thor- 
oughly performed sweeps away every ves- 
tige of this tactile mechanism, which is the 
seat of an important special sense, and brings 
down in the place of it a mucous membrane 
from above which is almost destitute of sensi- 
bility; hence many of the patients complain 
that they cannot tell when an evacuation 
of the bowels is impending, and only know 
of it when they feel it in the clothing. 
Others get a short warning, barely enough 
to enable them to rush to the closet in time. 
If the operation has been less deep, the dis- 
ability is not very bad. Some have a total 
or partial paralysis of the sphincter, and an 
incontinence of the faeces. 

I have opened a very extensive corre- 
spondence on this subject with eminent sur- 
geons in this country and Europe. The com- 
bined result is that one hundred and ninety- 
seven cases of bad results have been reported 
to me, in some of which the patients were 
reduced to the condition of miserable wrecks.

There is DO material difference betv. 
the operations. The results of both are often 
ven in the best of hands. 1 doctor Kelsey, 
of New York, a standard author on rectal 
subjects, estimates that even in skilled hands 
ten per cent, of these operations turn out 
badly. He says he has a constant revenue 
derived from repairing the mischiefs done 
by the "American operation." 

Professor Matthews, of Louisville, another 
standard author, says Whitehead's idea of 
the necessity of removing the whole pile- 
bearing area is chimerical. The ligature 
effects a cure in all these cases, and is much 
simpler and freer from danger. The so- 
called "American operation" is merely a 
modification of Whitehead's, and the neces- 
sity of doing it never exists except in an ill- 
balanced brain. I have seen a great number 
of physical wrecks from this uncalled-for 
"surgical procedure." Professor Moullin, of 
London, writes me that the operation is rarely 
done in that city. I find about four-fifths of 
American and European physicians opposed 
to its performance, and in my judgment its 
liability to bad results even in good hands 
will cause it rapidly to pass into oblivion.

NOTE ON MENOPAUSAL POLYSARCIA

BY W. P. MANTON, M.D.

but as patients have come to me within the 
past few years with the already made 
nosis of "ovarian tumor," I am led to believe 
that either the condition is not sufficiently 
understood, or methods of differentiation are 
often superficially or carelessly applied. 

There are only a few pathological states 
which are at all likely to be confused with 
fat-accumulation in the parietes, viz.: true 
lipomata; desmoid (fibroid) tumors of the 
abdominal wall; encysted peritonitis; hydat 
ids of the peritoneum; and, possibly, new 
growths of the omentum. A little care in 
physical examination will readily distinguish 
any one of these from diffuse fat-accumula 
tion in the belly-walls. 

Women affected with abdominal polysarcia 
often frighten themselves into the belief that 
they are the victims of a malignant tumor, 
and the assurance of the physician that the 
condition present is a perfectly normal one, 
devoid of danger, which will gradually disap 
pear as the fat is reabsorbed to be deposited 
in other portions of the body, will bring with 
it the greatest mental relief and satisfaction 
to the patient.

replied: "No— most decidedly not." But 
now, although the same query might provoke 
ja smile, a like reply would not so positively 
follow — for, explain what I both saw and 
heard on one occasion I cannot, but will sim- 
ply state the facts as they occurred: 

In the spring of 1891, my husband having 
been called away for some months, my sister 
and self, for the sake of our children, decided 
jto rent a cottage in the country, and, hearing 
of one that promised to be suitable a short 
^distance from the city of L , it was en- 
gaged, arrangements being made by mail 
;with the landlord. 

Naturally we looked forward with no little 
icuriosity to the first view of the region which 
was to be our summer home, and during the 
journey the children were all in great spirits, 
especially Tom, my eldest boy, aged ten, 
Iwhose importance culminated when we 
reached the terminus of our journey and he 
£was allowed to point out the different pieces 
jof luggage to the individual engaged to 
transfer our goods and chattels. 

The new residence being only a short 
jdistance from the station, we decided to walk, 
and after an experience of several hours 
Jin the heated cars found the shady lanes 
and bracing country air very refreshing, and 
(mutually agreed a wise choice had been made 
; in selecting "The Hermitage," as the new 
residence was termed. Indeed, at first view 
it seemed a restful spot where we might pass 
a few months most happily. 

The sun was setting behind the grove back 
of the house as we passed through the little 
igate along the grass-grown path which led to 
ithe hall door. The dwelling was small, and 
had evidently been built as a summer retreat, 
and the long Venetian windows opened upon 
a vine-covered verandah. Instituting further 
survey of our quarters, we inspected the 
rooms on the ground floor. From the small 
square hall containing the staircase opened 
two doors; the one at the end, and facing the 
entrance, revealed a large, bright and airy 
kitchen; that on the right a long room with 
an archway in the centre, the back part hav- 
ing been evidently used as a dining-room, as 
;a door also opened from it into the kitchen. 
Upstairs was a small passage and four good- 
sized sleeping-rooms. 

We distributed ourselves as follows: My 



sister took one of the front rooms; I, with 
my baby, the opposite; Tom, one of the back 
rooms, and the two little girls the other. 

Notwithstanding gayety and exuberant 
spirits, all seemed to experience a feeling of 
depression as soon as the house was entered, 
though none liked to admit it, fancying it 
the result of a fatiguing day upon the train. 
I hastened to boil the kettle, thinking we 
would feel better for some refreshment, and 
likewise sent Tom to the nearest neighbor 
for a jug of milk. When he returned I fancied 
he looked pale, and also while eating supper 
that he often started and looked behind as if 
expecting something. Soon we bundled the 
children off to bed, and, after chatting awhile, 
my sister and self also retired — but not to 
sleep, however, since, try as I might, sleep 
seemed impossible. Finally I lighted a lamp 
and began to read. 

After a while, feeling drowsy, I turned 
down the light, shaded it, placed it where it 
would not receive the draught from the two 
windows, and settled down again for the 
night. How long after I do not know, but 
suddenly I found myself sitting up in bed, 
the lamp out, and the room in perfect dark- 
ness except where a ray from the moon shone 
through the passage window between my 
apartment and that of my sister. Just then 
I saw her, as I supposed, leaving my room, 
and immediately remarked: "You gave me 
a great start, Annie. Why did you put out 
the light — did it disturb you ?" As she did 
not reply, I spoke again, and, still receiving 
no response, struck a match and lighted the 
lamp, in so doing noticing that the chimney 
was quite cold, hence the light must have 
been out for some time. I then passed to 
Annie's room, but, strange to say, found the 
door shut — we had arranged before retiring 
that it should stand open. I gave a gentle 
tap before entering, and found Annie asleep, 
but she instantly awoke and asked why I 
had shut the door after having agreed to 
leave it open. I replied I had not closed it, 
whereupon she responded in sleepy tones: 
"Most likely it was the wind." 

I now looked in on the children; the little 
girls were sleeping quietly, but Tom was wide 
awake and at once remarked: "I am glad 
you brought the lamp with you this time, 
mother. But why do you not go to bed in-

I did not care to tell him so. 
k ill my apartment, I threw myself on 
the bed, but it was quite daylight before I 
fell into a heavy sleep, from which I was 
only awakened by the romping and shouts of 
the children. 

With the advent of bright sunshine I suc- 
ceeded in throwing off my morbid feelings, 
and all went well through the day, and for 
that matter for several days; but every night 
regularly and at the same hour poor Tom 
would experience a most dreadful nightmare 
— something never known to occur before. 

( &gt;ne day he told me of a lady with a dark 
ulster over a light dress who frequently joined 
him in his walks, and once came quite up to 
the door, but had never spoken. He saw 
her for the first time the day of our arrival, 
when he went for the milk. This confidence 
was brought about by his aunt inquiring who 
was the lady in the dark ulster she had seen 
walking up the garden path with him. 

A few mornings after this I was busy in 
the kitchen when the door opened and some 
one came in. Supposing it was my sister, 
who was out for a walk, I did not turn 
around, but asked how far she had been. 
The only reply was a heavy sigh, when I 
turned just in time to see closed the door 
leading into the hall, and likewise obtain a 
glimpse of a woman's hand upon the knob. 
Immediately followed the opening and clos- 
ing of the outside hall door. I ran at once 
to the window, but could only see Annie 
leisurely sauntering up the little garden path. 
I met her at the entrance and inquired if she 
had encountered any one or passed through 
the kitchen, but to both queries obtained a 
negative. As the children were all off to a 
picnic a few miles away, it could not have 
been one of them. We searched the house 
and grounds in vain, and then Annie laugh- 
ingly suggested it might be our friend in the 
dark ulster, who certainly would find the 



garment somewhat uncomfortable for so 
. a day. We both however, not 

to mention the circumstance before the chil- 
dren, particularly as we had been quite 
anxious about Tom for some days past, and 
had decided to send him on the following 

:o BOOM friends at L for a COUp| 

of Wc 

The evening being somewhat cool, a fir 
was made in the kitchen, and after supper the 
children with their toys and books gathered 
around the table, which 1 had drawn into the 
middle of the room. Leaving them all busily 
employed, my sister and I passed upstairs to 
pack Tom's valise. Soon hearing one of the 
girls call, I returned, when the eldest re- 
marked: "Why, mother! how quickly you 
have dressed yourself ! When I saw you 
coming down in your night-dress and go into 
the parlor I asked if you were going to bed. 
What made you undress and dress up again?" 

"And mother!" added the younger, aged 
four, "why did you go up and down stairs so 
funny and go into the parlor and beckon to 
Tom ?" 

How could I answer these questions? 
Neither Annie nor I had left the chamber 
until I heard the call. I omitted to say there 
was no light in the hall except as reflected 
from the kitchen, and this latter so dim that 
while a figure could be seen, yet the indi- 
vidual could not be recognized. 

It had now become our regular habit to 
leave a light burning in the hall upstairs 
every night, but often, of a morning, it was 
found extinguished without any apparent 
reason, neither wick nor oil being defective. 

Tom went to L the next morning, and 

never once during his absence was troubled 
by nightmare. Things went on very much 
the same with us while he was away, and on 
his return we were beginning to feel it would 
be impossible to remain the three months fori 
which the house was engaged — we had then 
occupied the cottage about six weeks. 

The children were all delighted to see 
Tom, who arrived just before they retired 
and he followed suit soon after. At mid- 
night, the same hour he was generally dis- 
turbed before he went to L , he expe- 
rienced a very severe return of nightmare 
which lasted nearly an hour, after which he 
fell into heavy sleep.

From this time on things became worse. 
Doors would be opened and shut and lamps 
: extinguished, perhaps some one awakened 
oy slaps on the face. Even the younger 
! :hildren, who before had noticed nothing, 
iow began to notice these strange occur- 
rences, and ask who was the lady who cried 
In Tom's room every night. 

After another week we could stand it no 
longer, so packed up and moved to the village 
hotel. The night before leaving, however, 
hearing Tom moan, I passed into his room, 
fcwhen, to my horror, I saw the strange woman 
sitting on the bed with her arm thrown 
jiround him. She was apparently in night- 
press, with an ulster or wrapper over, her 
[long hair straight and lank down her back. 
[As I entered she raised her arms overhead, 
land with a long low wail vanished. I dropped 
[into the nearest chair too weak to stand, and 
(was there found by Annie, who had been 
(awakened by the unearthly cry. Meantime 
[Tom, who had been weeping and moaning 
(without waking, turned over quietly with a 
jsigh of relief and thereafter appeared to rest 
peacefully. 

A couple of days following the removal 
to the hotel, while out walking, we stopped 
jto beg a drink from a pleasant-faced elderly 
iwoman engaged in hanging out washing. 
After " passing the time of day," as the say- 
ling is, we inquired how long she had resided 
in the village, the response being: "Girl and 
iwoman, nigh onto fifty years." 

Did she know anything of the people who 
ihad formerly occupied " The Hermitage ? " 

"Aye! that do I," she replied, "and a 
Igruesome place it is since the poor forsaken 
ilady died there come these two years next 
'month." I then asked if she would relate 
the circumstances connected with this lady's 
death, and in what way the place had become 
gruesome. Whereupon she sat down upon a 
bench and began a narrative which, as near 
as possible, I give in her own words, though 
necessarily somewhat abbreviated: 

"I know you are the ladies who have been 
living at the cottage the past six weeks, and 
have been surprised that you remained so 
long, since the former tenants stayed only 
four days, and Went straight to the train with- 
out telling any one the reason for leaving so 
suddenly — and they, like yourselves, had 



rented the place for the summer months. 
This was a year ago. 

"A month before you came, a lady and her 
little boy came to look at the cottage with a 
view to renting it, but in less than an hour 
returned and inquired when the next train 

would leave for L . I inquired how she 

liked the cottage, when she replied: 'Not at 
all,' and that nothing would induce her to 
enter the house, for she felt sure it was 
haunted or some curse was upon it. She had 
no sooner entered the house by the front door 
than she experienced a feeling of oppression 
that continually increased until the back door 
was reached, when she left the house that 
way, all the time feeling conscious some one 
was following her. I did not laugh, and no 
more will you when you hear what I have to 
tell: 

"A little better than two years since, a 
gentleman and lady with a little boy, about 
ten years old, came to live at this cottage. 
The gentleman claimed to have business in 
the city which kept him a great deal from his 
family, though he frequently came to see 
them and sometimes remained for a couple 
of days. The lady was very delicate, did 
not often go out, but when she did was 
always accompanied by the child, to whom 
she seemed most devoted. I used to go to 
the cottage to wash, scrub, and do odd jobs, 
so that is how I came to know these particu- 
lars. 

"After they had been there a few weeks 
the gentleman came from the city and went 
back the same day, taking the boy with him. 
A day later he again returned, but alone. 

"Whenever I went to the house after this' 
the lady was always in tears; her health grew 
worse and she failed rapidly, seemingly pining 
for her child. 

" One evening as I was coming from the 
cottage I met Mr. , accompanied by an- 
other lady. He paused to ask me how his 
wife was, when I informed him she was very 
ill. He responded that he hoped good nurs- 
ing would soon bring her around, and for 
that purpose he had brought her sister to 
visit her — I must say I could trace no family 
resemblance between this lady and the in- 
valid, nor did I like the looks or general ap- 
pearance of the former. 

"After this the gentleman remained at the

cottage more constantly, and he and the 
strange lady ■■■ icr of an 

ing walking in the lanes or seated in the 
garden; and from this time, for about three 
weeks. 1 never .saw the sick lady when I went 

to the cottage. Then one evening, 

home the washir. . gentleman and his 

in-law hem- at supper chatting pleas- 
antly, I set down the basket and went quietly 
lire, where I found the poor invalid suf- 
g great pain and very cold. She seemed 
glad at my incoming, and asked that I 
should not leave her. I wrapped her in an 
ulster which was hanging on the wall, ran 

downstairs and told Mr. that his wife 

ery ill and that he should go for a phy- 
sician at once, which he did: but the poor 
lady died in great agony before he returned. 
She clung to me and tried very hard to tell 
me something about her boy, but I could not 
make out what she wished to say, as her 
breathing was so short and her voice so low 
and weak. 

11 1 shall never forget the look of misery 
on the poor lady's face when she saw I did 
not understand her. She died with her head 
on my shoulder, just before her husband ar- 
rived. He said the doctor was away and 
would not be home until morning. He tele- 
graphed at once to L for a casket, which 

arrived next day, and the whole party left 
on the noon train. 

" That is all I know about them, but before 

leaving Mr. paid liberally and engaged 

me to clean up the place; and glad I was 
when the work was done, as all the time I 
fancied I heard the poor lady's moans. It is 
no wonder to me she cannot rest quietly in 
her grave, as, at the time of her death, and 
for some time previous, she was troubled 
about her boy, evidently not knowing whether 
he was happy and well treated or not." 

We thanked the old woman and left. On 
going over the whole affair as told, my sister 
and I agreed with the old woman that the 
poor lady was before her death sadly troubled 
as to the fate of her child, so much so that 
her spirit could not rest but came back to her 
old home (if such a thing is possible) where 
she had lost her boy, hoping to find him 
again; and, not seeing him, she liked to be 
near Tom, who was about the same age as 
her own child when he was taken from her.

PSORIASIS.* 

!:Y DOC lOK J. K. KKSTKLL. 

In this brief paper I shall present nothing 
as to symptoms, history, or pathology, except 
as they refer directly to the case in point. 

In August of last year, Miss (i , 19 

years of age, placed herself under my care 
for a trouble I diagnosed as chronic psoriasis 
— a diagnosis which was corroborated by a 
New York specialist, she having made a two 
months' sojourn in the Eastern metropolis 
three months subsequent to my diagnosis. 

This lady had been affected to a greater 
or less degree during five years, and had 
been treated by several practitioners with 
only partial relief. As a result she was 
thoroughly discouraged and preferred death 
to living. Although the conclusions I arrived 
at were not encouraging, at the outset, I re- 
solved to pay strict attention to three factors 
in the case, viz., functional activity of the 
alimentary canal, ditto of skin and of kidneys, 
and thereby, if possible, so improve these 
conditions that oxydation should be pro- 
moted and abnormal products of blood re- 
moved. 

Her history, to be brief, was not good, the 
origin of the trouble being distinctly syphil- 
itic, manifestations of which were very appar- 
ent in one of the parents. Her entire head 
was one mass of scales to the edge of the 
hair, and on forehead and neck also; the 
lower lobes of the ears were in a terrible con- 
dition. Extensor and flexor surfaces of arms 
exhibited patches, and a few were to be seen 
on the legs. 

First of all I advised her to diet — encour- 
aged the use of vegetables, milk, etc., forbid- 
ding eggs, meat, coffee, wine, and beers. 

During the first month I prescribed Blaud's 
pills, improved, before meals, Fowler's solu-

ciety.

tion after meals. Second month I ordered 
pills of calcium sulphide, one-half grain each, 
before meals, with the arsenical solution and 
phospho-muriate of quinine after meals; twice 
daily she took a mixture of spirit of min- 
dererus, digitalis, and jaborandi, as a diapho- 
retic and diuretic; and once a week a capsule 
of calomel, bicarbonate of soda, and aloin, 
followed next morning by a saline laxative. 
At commencement of second month I also 
ordered her, three evenings a week prior to 
retiring, to take hot bath, with hot drinks; 
likewise to apply cod-liver oil to the affected 
parts, keeping the latter covered all night 
with oiled paper, and next morning, after 
scales were removed as far as feasible, to 
apply an ointment of pyrogallic acid, and, 
when itching was most severe, applications 
of solution of chloral hydrate. 

At the end of the second month her gen- 
eral health was improved, but the skin trouble 
showed little betterment. While continuing 
internal medication as before, I tried applica- 
tions of an ointment of mercury subchloride, 
iodine, and lard — after epidermis was re- 
moved with wet bird-sand this ointment 
was well rubbed in. In about two hours after 
the first application of this ointment, there 
suddenly developed a condition of suffering 
so great that she became hysterical; the skin 
was dry, hot, and very much puckered up. I 
immediately gave a hypodermatic injection 
of pilocarpine muriate, one- eighth grain, and 
subjected her to the action of steam, when 
relief soon followed. I repeated these pro- 
cedures twice a week, and three times had to 
repeat the pilocarpine injections; but with 
the sixth application no inconvenience was 
manifested and improvement supervened. 
She now made such rapid progress toward 
recovery that in the course of four months 
little was left as evidence of disease, and for 
the first time in nearly five years her skin 
was in good condition; with the improved 
health she also gained in weight. 

Although at times a little evidence of 
trouble appears, appropriate attention by 
way of inunction and treatment causes it to 
disappear. Every alternate month she con- 
tinues tonic treatment, which I advised to be 
continued for some time; she also pays strict 
attention to diet and habits.

PNEUMONIA. 



BY DARIUS L. POWE, M.D. 

This is a disease which, if once seen and 
the symptoms closely observed, cannot be 
mistaken for any other. Confusion may pos- 
sibly arise in the first stage on account of its 
close resemblance to acute bronchitis or acute 
pleurisy, but the misleading symptoms dis- 
appear when the malady is fully established. 
The tendency, in the majority of cases under 
favorable hygienic environment, is toward a 
spontaneous recovery; nevertheless, annually 
a large percentage die, regardless of our 
boasted scientific medication. A glance over 
the death certificates of all countries, and es- 
pecially of the United States, shows that a 
vast number of the great and brilliant lights 
in the medical profession have been extin- 
guished by this disease. 

More extensive investigation is necessary 
to fully confirm the aetiology of the disease. 
The theory that sudden changes in tempera- 
ture is the principal cause cannot be accepted. 
The most extreme exposure in all kinds of 
weather does not always result in pneumonia 
— which is evidence that a certain condition 
of the system is essential to its inception. In 
my judgment, unhealthy conditions of the 
skin, the result of improper care, rank first 
among the predisposing causes. 

There is no disease of any magnitude that 
runs a more definite course than a case of 
uncomplicated croupous pneumonia. The 
first forty eight hours comprise the stage of 
congestion and engorgement, and at the close 
of this period hepatization is usually com- 
plete: marked dullness on percussion maybe 
found over the diseased part of the lung. In 
this form of the disease the lesion is usually 
confined to one lobe, or part of one lobe. 
The fourth and fifth days include the term of 
hepatization. 

In favorable cases, resolution frequently 
occurs on the fifth day and on the sixth the 
inflammatory deposit is almost completely 
removed by absorption. In complicated 
and unfavorable cases, resolution may be 
delayed until the seventh or eighth day. 
In fatal cases, gray hepatization takes place 
on the eighth day and death occurs within

Ltfa. 

r formulated a rat 
treatment for pneumonia, one that in prac- 
tice meets the entire approval of any — ex- 
cepting himstlf; therefore the treatment must 
necessarily be largely empirical. 

The principal object for which the physi- 
cian is called is to relieve pain caused by the 

:on of the disease. In some ca&gt; - 
hypodermatic injection of morphine m 
necessary, especially if the patient is ex- 
tremely nervous and insists upon immediate 
relief; otherwise a dose of ipecac compound, 
once every three to six hours, will very ma- 
terially relieve the pain and render the pa- 
tient more comfortable. If respiration is 
short, quick, and performed in a gasping 
manner, a full dose of lobelia in connection 
with asclepias will quickly relieve by relaxing 
muscular rigidity. The arterial sedatives — 
aconite if the pulse is frequent and small, 
veratrum if full and bounding— may be given 
alternately with the lobelia and asclepias, 
about every hour, until hepatization is com- 
plete. When this stage is reached, the pain 
usually subsides; then bryonia alba is sub- 
stituted for the lobelia and asclepias, and 
under this in connection with a supportive 
treatment uncomplicated cases almost invari- 
ably recover. 

The important object to be accomplished 
is to regulate the action of the heart. If the 
pulse rate is not allowed to exceed 120 beats 
per minute, with a corresponding tempera- 
ture of about 104 , the patient is compara- 
tively safe and capable of withstanding the 
force of the disease; the continued excessive 
action of the heart not only exhausts its 
poweV of functional endurance but acts as a 
battering ram, forcing the blood into a com- 
paratively impervious lung, causing more 
dense and complete engorgement and hepa- 
tization, a condition extremely unfavorable 
to absorption and a speedy recovery. 

In mild as well as severe cases I invariably 
apply to the chest the compound powder of 
lobelia and capsicum, dusted on a cloth pre- 
viously spread with either lard or vaselin; 
this is renewed twice daily and continued 



throughout the duration of th&lt; The 

enveloped in a cotton- 
jacket that is not removed until absorp- 
tion is complete. 

In complicated cases the complication is 
usually the most serious feature and requires 
first attention. If a bilious condition existi 
— indicated by a semi-&lt; omatose state, tongue 
heavily coated, especially at the base, with a 
yellowy pasty substance, bowels constipated 
— an emeto- cathartic will give the best and 
quickest results. If oedema of the lungs, or- 
hydrothorax, occurs, prompt relief will be 
derived from administration of tincture or 
infusion of Apocynum cannabinum as a diuretic 
cathartic. Typhoid symptoms will usually 
subside under the influence of antiseptics, 
my own preference being for baptisi 
sulphite of soda. 

In impending heart failure, cactus grandi- 
florus, digitalis, nitro-glycerin, convallaria, 
strophantus and alcoholic stimulants are 
given as indicated -recently I had very grat- 
ifying results from the administration of the 
double chloride of gold and soda in combi- 
nation with nitrate of strychnia. 

But when we have exhausted our skill and 
also the materia medica in a vain search 
after effective remedies, and seem obliged to 
sit placidly by and acknowledge defeat, while 
death unmolested claims the patient as a vic- 
tim, we have at least one resource that if prop 
erly and scientifically applied will surpass i 
favorable effect all other forms of treatmen 
— one that can, moreover, be applied at al 
stages of the disease and repeated when the 
temperature threatens to rise above a saf 
point. This, on account of its simplicity, ha 
not received from physicians the investiga 
tion it really merits, yet those who have b 
actual experience tested its virtues testif 
highly in its favor. I have repeatedly place 
patients suffering from pneumonia and in 
delirious and semi-comatose state, in a m 
pack, and in two or three hours have arouse 
them from a refreshing sleep and had the 
extreme satisfaction of finding them in a per- 
fectly rational condition. Since adopting this 
method I have not had to sign a death cer- 
tificate resulting from this disease.

THE NEURO=MOTORY DISTURBANCES OF 
THE LARYNX. 

BY DOCTOR P. RAUGE. 
{Continued f?-o?n page 3Qi.) 

Despite the few contradictory views with 
respect to the mode of action of the cortical 
laryngeal centre, the significance and extent 
of its action, and the result of its morbid 
.esions, authorities have hitherto been unani- 
mous in according it an undisputed control 
over the phonatory movements. I here re- 
ball for mere mention the endeavor of Ross- 
Oach, who, supported by a single observation, 
fancied he might attribute to the insula a 
fc&gt;art in the phonic innervation of the larynx.* 
iBut'the question has recently been compli- 
cated by a series of experiments, the results 
■ which were reported by M. Onodi at the 
Sixty-sixth Congress of German Naturalists 
ind Physicians at Vienna.f He recognizes, 
with many others, the existence of a cortical 
centre, confirms its localization, and verifies 
ts bilateral action on the movements of ad- 
duction ; but he observes that this centre is 
n no wise indispensable to the exercise of 
phonation. For proof he cites the fact that 
:;he voice persists after destruction of the 
|:entre in both hemispheres, hence there must 
bxist elsewhere a more profound motory 
iocus, the presistence of which assures the 
conservation of the voice in the preceding 
experiment; it remained only to determine 
Its seat, and this M. Onodi is said to have 
discovered by performing through the brain 
:he series of successive sections so dear to 
|:he Vienna school. He concludes that there 
exists, back of the transverse sulcus which 
separates the anterior from the posterior 
quadrigeminal tubercles, a zone of eight 
millimeters containing this focus: while this 
region remains united to the bulb the animals 
under experiment retain the faculty of cry- 
ing, but they become completely mute as 
soon as it is separated therefrom. 

Regarding the intra-cerebral course of the 
cortico-bulbar fibres, it may be admitted a 
triori that the cortical laryngeal centre sends

forth, like all the cortical centres, a system 
of white fascicles which descend through the 
corona radiata, the internal capsule, the 
peduncle, and the protuberance, terminating 
below in the midst of the gray nuclei of the 
bulb. Although physiology and the clinic 
have thus far yielded us very little informa- 
tion respecting the passage of these unifying 
fibres, I believe it is not impossible, by resort- 
ing to certain analogies and utilizing all 
identifying marks, to establish with some 
probability the position of this fascicle in the 
different regions of its course. We know 
whence it starts — foot of the ascending fron- 
tal; we know where it terminates — nucleus 
of the pneumogastric and probably of the 
spinal; and finally, we owe to an autopsy of 
Garel the knowledge of a third landmark in- 
dicating its course, viz., the position assumed 
by this laryngeal fascicle at the level of the 
internal capsule. From Garel's observation 
we know that the laryngo-motory fascicle 
occupies the external part of the angle — that 
is, the point where the white substance of the 
capsule is in immediate contact with the sum- 
mit of the lenticular nucleus. Now, recalling 
the course followed in the hemisphere by the 
fascicle which Professor Lepine and MM. 
Raymond and Artaud have called the genicu- 
lated fascicle, one is struck with the fact that 
at the three identifying points at which we 
have heretofore been able to determine the 
position of the laryngo-motory fascicle it is 
merged with the geniculated fascicle; it be- 
gins and terminates with the latter, travers- 
ing the angle or knee and the internal cap- 
sule at the same point; may we not then 
assume that the two courses are united at 
other points and that the fibres of the larynx 
are a fascicle superadded to those of the 
masticatory nerve, of the hypoglossis, and of 
the inferior facial, hitherto regarded as form- 
ing by their union the sole elements of the 
geniculated fascicle? With these data, may 
we not assume that the entire course of the 
laryngeal fascicle is as follows: Beginning in 
the cortical layer, at the level of the foot of 
the ascending frontal, perhaps of the third 
frontal and of the furrow which separates, 
it traverses in the oval centre, the inferior 
frontal fascicle of Pitres' third section; lower 
down we see it in the internal capsule, in 
contact with the lenticular nucleus; then

the protubera and within the 

pyramidal fascicle, until the moment when 
- with the opposite fascicle before 
plunging into the bulbar nuclei. 

Representation in the bulb of laryngeal 
innervation is at present the subject of much 

.. dn^\ it is rather difficult ' 
forth the question clearly amid the disputes 
by which it is befogged. In the inner \ 
of the larynx, what is the role of this portion 
of the cerebrospinal axis, and which among 
ay nuclei are those whence this innerva- 
tion proceeds' What path does it follow in 
going from the surface of the bulb to the 
trunk of the pneumogastric ? Does it pass 
through the roots of this nerve, or through 
the roots of the spinal, or both ways at once ? 
Does each of these two orders of roots bring 
separately to the common trunk the two dis- 
tinct influences, one of which directs the res- 
piratory act and the other the phonatory act ? 
Such are the delicate questions which for- 
merly received the most precise response and 
the clearest solution, viz.: That there are two 
columns of gray substance, representing the 
nucleus of the spinal nerve and that of the 
pneumogastric; from each of these two nuclei 
a fascicle of nerve roots bringing to the 
common trunk one of the two forms of motory 
activity — the spinal exclusively commissioned 
to transmit the vocal influence, the pneumo- 
gastric the respiratory activity: these two 
modes of innervation confounded in the com- 
mon trunk above the point of anastomosis of 
the spinal. Such was the seductive theory 
which summarized as recently as ten years 
ago the dogma of laryngeal innervation. 

To this simple formula has been opposed 
for some time, not another formula, but a se- 
ries of contradictory opinions which agree 
only in repudiating the ancient doctrine, and 
the most modern and fashionable of which 
consists in refusing to the spinal nerve any 
intervention in the laryngeal movements. 

Before discussing the value of this subver- 
sive anatomy, and indicating the regrettable 
modifications which the experimental conclu- 
sions of Claude Bernard have suffered at the 
hands of the German physiologists, permit 



me to recall briefly the orthodox anatomy of 
the bulb and its traditional phys 
as the origins of laryngeal innerv 
concerned. 

We know the transformation which the 
j of the marrow undergoes to form 
at the level of the bulb the nuclei of th 
cranial pairs. At the height of the bee 
calamus (point or horn of the calam 
canal of the ependyma opens at it 
part and extends into the large chann 
which is no other than the fourth ventricle. 
This opening in the central canal 
by an inversion of the base of the f&lt; 
major which, up to that point, limited this 
canal at the rear and which is now placed 
(not back of, but) within the base of the for- 
ceps minor. At this level there is thus 
formed, from each side of the median raph 






or suture, two gray vertical columns, juxt 
posed and parallel, immediately subjacent to 
the floor of the fourth ventricle. The most 
internal (posterior motory) column repre- 
sents the base of the forceps minor, the head 
of which has been separated by the inter- 
crossing of the pyramids; it constitutes, as 
we know, below, the nucleus of the hypo- 
glossis (internal white wing), higher up the 
nuclei of the motory nerves of the ey 
The external column (posterior sensory) r 
sponds similarly to the base of the decapi 
tated forceps major. From the side, by thi 
antero-posterior passage of the sensory fibr 
of Burdach's fascicle into the lateral senso: 
fascicle, are formed (gray wing) the senso 
nuclei of the glossopharyngeal and of th 
pneumogastric, and, higher up, that of th 
auditory nerve. Hence it is this part of the 
gray substance of the bulb which contains the 
sensory nuclei of the laryngeal mucous mem- 
brane. Anterior to this sensory tract, but 
far more deeply plunged into the thickness 
of the bulb, is a motory column (anterior 
motory column, antero-lateral nucleus of 
Stilling) formed by the head of the forceps 
minor, separated, as we have seen, from its 
base. This column is to us of capital im- 
portance, since it contains, from the bottom 
to the top, the motory nuclei of the spinal, 
the pneumogastric, and the glossopharyngeal 
nerves — that is, all the bulbar centres which 
preside over the motility of the larynx. 

We see that the -laryngeal nerves possess! 



THE MEDICAL AGE.

iin the bulb two nuclei of origin juxtaposed 
tfrom the front to the back and separated by 
a tolerable thickness of white substance: the 
base of the forceps major, origin of the sen- 
sory fibres; the head of the forceps minor, 
origin of the motory fibres. 

It remains for us to examine how the mo- 
tory roots emerge from the nuclei which we 
:have just described, and how they are asso- 
ciated to form the nerve trunks. The upper 
part of Stilling's nucleus sends forth seven or 
eight fillets which pass out of the lateral fur- 
row below the glosso-pharyngeal nerve and 
soon unite into a common trunk — the trunk 
of the pneumogastric. Further down, yet 
always in the lateral sinus, emerge five or 
six roots which are presently fused like the 
preceding ones to form a common fascicle, 
the trunk of the bulbar spinal. But this 
trunk, scarcely formed, soon loses its inde- 
pendence and plunges into the pneumogastric 
(internal branch of the spinal) at the level of 
the supero-external part of the plexiform 
ganglion. From this moment the trunk of 
the pneumogastric represents a very complex 
fascicle in which are inextricably confounded, 
( in the midst of foreign elements, all the nerve 
fibres destined for the larynx — those fibres 
which the pneumogastric owes to its own 
roots as well as those which it has received 
from the anastomosis of the spinal. Despite 
this intimate fusion, the fibres of the spinal 
nerve and those of the vagus yet preserve a 
physiological independence in harmony with 
their diversity of origin. We know with what 
clearness Claude Bernard showed the differ- 
erence of their roles in innervation of the 
larynx, the fibres of the spinal bringing pho- 
natory motility, those of the pneumogastric 
respiratory motility. I cannot pause to de- 
scribe the memorable experiments by which 
I this physiological dissociation was estab- 
lished: suffice it to recall the fact that by 
removing the spinal nerve Bernard rendered 
animals aphonic, whilst section of the pneu- 
mogastric suppressed the respiratory move- 
ments. 

But this luminous conception of the double 
bulbar origin of the two modes of laryngeal 
activity has been shaken by modern experi- 
ments. For the classical doctrine have been 
substituted a whole series of unforeseen and 
diverging affirmations. Thus the pneumo- 



gastric, after having been first deprived of 
all influence on the movements of the larynx, 
is now considered as their sole and all-power- 
ful director; the experiments of'Grabower, 
confirmed by those of Grossmann, have in- 
deed stripped for its profit the internal branch 
of the spinal, removal or section of the latter 
being in their estimation without any influ- 
ence on any of the forms of motility of the 
vocal cords. At the last Congress of Ger- 
man Naturalists and Physicians (Vienna, 
September, 1894) M. Onodi reiterates his 
experimental arguments against the spinal 
nerve and again denies its influence over 
laryngeal innervation. Removal of this nerve 
at the neck or in the head, duly confirmed on 
autopsy — its section — its electric excitation 
— in a word, all the forms used in nervous 
experimentation, are claimed by this author 
to have yielded the same negative conclusion. 
Despite the contradictions and surprises 
to which we are accustomed in experimental 
researches, there prevails between the results 
of modern physiologists and those of forty 
years ago too singular an opposition to per- 
mit our explaining it simply by the progress 
of technique or difference in experimenters. 
If the same removal of the spinal nerve 
which uniformly rendered mute the cats of 
Claude Bernard, leaves undisturbed the vocal 
powers of M. Onodi's dogs, there is some- 
thing wrong either in the method of the ex- 
periment or the manner of construing it. 
For my own part I can find but one plausible 
explanation, and that is that the spinal nerve 
which is to-day removed is no longer the^ 
spinal nerve of Claude Bernard. I hasten to 
explain a supposition which may seem rather 
bold. We know that the spinal nerve pro- 
ceeds from the nerve axis by two very differ- 
ent orders of roots — a long lower series of 
fillets proceeding from the marrow which go 
to form the external branch, and four or five 
bulbar roots which are fused in the trunk of 
the internal branch, the latter, as soon as 
formed, plunging into the pneumogastric. 
From this disposition it follows that the 
bulbar roots of the spinal nerve are some- 
times very difficult to separate from those 
of the pneumogastric, to which one is 
tempted to unite them; and this confu- 
sion is so natural that it prevailed in the 
classical descriptions until Scarpa's day.

spinal. Now I cannot help believing, in 
of their experimental results, that the gain- 
ale Bernard have, without bus- 
. returned to Willis's conception of 
spinal nerve. If they can remove this 
with impunity and without damage to 
the laryngeal function, it is perhaps because 
they remove only the medullary spinal, which, 
in fact, exerts no action on the larynx, and 
innervates only the sterno-mastoid and the 
trapezius. If, on the other hand, they accord 
to the pneumogastric this surprising omnipo- 
tence over laryngeal innervation, is it not 
because they have annexed to it the bulbar 
roots of the spinal — those which form the in- 
ternal branch and constitute, if I may so 
term it, the veritable laryngeal spinal ? I am 
well aware that M. Grabower in a recent 
memoir* protests indignantly against such a 
humiliating confusion. But, for my own part, 
his arguments, far from persuading me, lend 
support to my suspicion. M. Grabower 
shows by a series of microscopic sections 
that the gray nucleus of the spinal nerve 
ascends far less high in the bulb than has 
hitherto been admitted; that it is arrested at 
the level of the median part of the inter- 
crossing of the pyramids, and continues 
above, not in the nucleus of the pneumo- 
gastric nerve, which remains absolutely dis- 
tinct from it, but in the nucleus of the hypo- 
glossis. This origin of the spinal nerve, not 
less than the disposition of its roots, brings 
M. Grabower to the conclusion that the ac- 
cessory "is a nerve exclusively medullary." 
Can this phrase, twice repeated in the memoir, 
be aught else than an avowal of the confu- 
sion which I have just mentioned? If the 
spinal nerve of M. Grabower does not pene- 
trate into the bulb, this signifies clearly that 
he removes from Scarpa's spinal nerve its 
nuclei and its bulbar roots; and if he re- 
moves from the spinal to give to the pneu- 
mogastric the only portion of the former 
which acts on the larynx, it is not surprising

that the first is deprived, to the profit of the 
second, of all power over the motility of the 
should thus no longer ha-. 
• en the ancients and the modern 
experimental discord which nothing ca: 
plain, but rather a simple misunderstanding 
in the partition and nomenclature of the 
i of nerve roots superposed in the lateral 
furrow of the bulb. It would then be simply 
necessary to reach an understand 
the number and position of the radicular fas- 
cicles which should be credited to the spinal 
nerve or attributed to the pneumogastric. 

I now reach the region of the neuro-laryn- 
geal apparatus in which all the original fillets, 
merged in a common trunk, pursue through 
the density of the neck and in the thoracic 
cavity that strange and complicated course 
which conducts them as far as the summit of 
the thorax, only to bring them back to the 
larynx by a long recurrent passage which 
seems to be a useless detour. It might be 
supposed that in quitting the ill-known re- 
gions of the nerve centres we have finished 
with hypotheses and theoretical contentions; 
but we shall here also encounter one of 
the greatest difficulties that has confronted 
neuro-pathology for ten years. I refer to 
the interpretation of that form of motory 
disturbance which writers continue to desig- 
nate under the name of paralysis of the 
abductors, although they are farther than 
ever from agreeing with respect to the mech- 
anism which this designation seems to affirm, 
and although it is perhaps more prudent to 
retain provisionally the title "permanent ad- 
duction," which expresses only a clinical as- 
pect. I here limit myself to setting forth as 
rapidly as possible the delicate terms of the 
controversy, and to showing the positions 
which are now actually occupied on this field 
by the two adverse opinions: 

From the point where the spinal nerve 
merges into the pneumogastric, up to the 
point where the recurrent commences to 
ramify, the fascicle of laryngeal nerves trans- 
ports, closely united, all the motory fibres of 
the larynx, with the exception of the superior 
laryngeal (which detaches itself from the 
common trunk at its very origin at the level 
of the plexiform ganglion). Lost in the trunk 
of the vagus amid foreign fibres, resuming 
further on its independence when it becomes 



THE MEDICAL AGE.

the recurrent, this fascicle, in its double jour- 
ney, certainly represents the most exposed 
and the most frequently attacked of all the 
nerve cords of the organism. This undesir- 
able privilege it owes first to its long course, 
but especially to the adjacence of a series of 
organs whose disorders it frequently shares 
either through direct propagation or by simple 
compression. 

Let us imagine — this is the simplest way — 
that one of these neighboring lesions, or a 
primitive alteration, or a traumatism of the 
nerve, has destroyed totally or annulled func- 
tionally the ensemble of the motory fascicle: 
the result may be readily foreseen and offers 
small ground for discussion; complete paral- 
! ysis supervenes; the vocal cord is immobile, 
in cadaveric position, incapable of any dis- 
placement, whether of vocal adduction or of 
respiratory abduction. 

But it is not customary for the nerve trunk 
to undergo at the outset this complete an- 
nihilation. Before being thus suppressed, it 
must inevitably traverse a phase of partial 
paralysis or preliminary irritation which in a 
goodly number of cases forms the limit of 
the disease. It would seem a priori that 
among these incomplete forms we might ex- 
pect to encounter a great variety of aspects, 
in proportion to the multiplicity of the nerve 
fibres contained in the common trunk, and 
that all the forms imaginable of partial par- 
alysis and dissociated contraction might be 
realized in this manner, in accordance with 
the unforeseen character of the compressions 
or the chances of morbid propagation. Now, 
instead of this variety which Theory predicts, 
Experience has shown that all the lesions of 
the common trunk which are not total lesions 
present, with a singular monotony, a symp- 
tomatic aspect always the same: permanent 
adduction of the cords, and respiratory 
troubles resulting mechanically from defec- 
tive dilatation of the glottis, with integrity 
of the vocal function. Such is the singular 
law, the paternity of which is shared by MM. 
Rosenbach and Semon. When the clinic 
had established the generality of this form- 
ula, investigators did not fail to seek a theo- 
retical interpretation; and here commence 
the divergences of doctrine which ten years 
of discussion have not succeeded in over- 
coming. The more ancient opinion, that 



which M. Semon continues to defend with 
indefatigable energy, attributes to the defec- 
tive action of the dilators this permanent 
state of adduction, the constancy of which is 
affirmed by the laryngoscope. But in that 
case, how explain why in this dissociated 
form of paralysis it is always the abductors 
which are separately attacked or are the first 
to be affected? And by what singular privi- 
lege do the other muscles of the larynx es- 
cape destructive alterations which, it would 
seem logically, must strike blindly and with 
equal frequency each muscle of the organ? 
This species of discrimination in the seat of 
the lesion, or this lesser resistance attributed 
to one muscular group or to one fascicle of 
the nerve trunk, evidently represents the 
weak point in the doctrine. To escape the 
difficulty, investigators sought in permanent 
adduction a more probable mechanism, the 
facility of its production being related to the 
repetition of the symptom. It was thus that 
we were led to doubt the frequency of this 
systematic paralysis of the dilators. In its 
place was substituted the simpler notion of 
total contraction, the original genesis of 
which was more readily comprehended, since 
to produce it it was sufficient that an irritative 
lesion attack indiscriminately, without choice 
and without preference, all the fibres of the 
nerve trunk (Krause). The two varieties of 
deformation produced most commonly in the 
aspect of the glottis by the lesions of the 
nerve trunk were thus reduced to a mechan- 
ism uniform and, in a manner, symmetrical — 
the total destruction of this trunk producing 
the cadaveric glottis, and its total irritation 
producing permanent adduction. There thus 
existed henceforth only the alterations en 
masse, striking in one sense or another the 
ensemble of the motory fascicle; and we were 
obliged to cease admitting in these cases 
those dissociated lesions whose frequency 
Ziemssen formerly affirmed, and which the 
law of Rosenbach-Semon had already singu- 
larly restricted by limiting their possibility 
solely to paralysis of the abductors. 

Such are the terms of the controversy now 
proceeding between the defenders of paralysis 
and the partisans of contraction. I confine 
myself to a statement of the problem, simply 
laying down its terms and preparing for its 
discussion.

Although this system of absurdity is rapidly 
. a still seems a try to nol 
for the purpose of discoTering 
why it is usually condemned by scientific 
physicians. When a physician -othis 

if bigotry, and people 
will sometimes say that regular physicians 
are blinded by prejudice and cannot be in- 
duced to study the truly scientific theories of 
the "new school." The gentlemen of the 
11 new school " always speak of regular phy- 
sicians as belonging to the "old school," 
frequently using this method as a means of 
recommending themselves, always endeavor- 
ing to convey the idea that regular physi- 
cians never read or study anything, and that 
they use nothing but mercury, antimony, 
emetics, and large tly-blisters, and nearly 
always have recourse to venesection; that, in 
fact, they employ nothing but the most crude 
remedies and practice medicine very much 
the same as they did about two hundred 
years ago. One seldom meets one of these 
little-pill men who can talk intelligently on 
scientific subjects, for they never get the 
training or education required to become 
physicians. This system of "attenuation" 
seems like a side-door or back-door for the 
various nondescripts to get into the ranks of 
the medical profession without study or train- 
ing. Let a man buy a case of little pills and 
other " potencies," with a book of instruc- 
tions, and he at once becomes a physician. 

This peculiar specimen of the "genus 
homo" will practice on the principle of the 
old woman: "If I do you no good I'll do 
you no harm." It would certainly be a rec- 
ommendation to a physician to know that he 
never did any harm, but although a man may 
not do harm by active measures he may do 
an immense amount of harm by passive treat- 
ment, and this system of negation is not 
always to be desired. There should be no 
amateur physicians, and yet we find clergy- 
men and other people outside of the profes- 
sion who are always ready to dabble in the 
practice of medicine. This is entirely wrong, 
for it not only interferes with the regular 
profession, but it Looks like unpardonable 
conceit with a strong desire for cheap noto- 
riety. I know of a clergyman, without train- 
ing or experience in medicine, who prescribed 
for a patient — a slight hemorrhage being the 
only symptom. This amateur "potentizer" 






th the st ate men: 
the- upture of the pleura three inchi 

.;— a ilia- '. inch would be next tol 

imp with the most scientific and 

erienced physician. This mainly 

misrepresentation, which not only - a 

bad impression but cause look upon 

such amateurs with more or less - sp cion. 

With respect to domestic medicine, nothing 
but the most simple medicines should be 
used, and only in cases of emergent 
temporary relief, while waiting for the ar- 
rival of the physician. We look upon all 
these interlopers just the same as they would 
look upon us if we attempted to perform the 
duties of a clergyman in connection with the 
various church ceremonies. A story is re- 
lated where one of these "medicine men" 
was called to attend a case of colic in a 
young boy. The usual two teacups half- full 
of water were left, with directions, and theB 
parents were told that the boy would get 
relief in about a day and a half. Now it is 
well known that a sharp attack of colic en- 
gages a person's attention pretty thoroughly 
for the time being; and after the boy had 
been shouting and yelling like a Comanche 
for about an hour, a physician of the common- • 
sense school was sent for, who relieved the 
boy in a short time with some ordinary ano- 
dyne. The doctor made the statement that 
the boy would certainly have been relieved 
in a day and a half, for he would then take 
his departure for the sweet bye-and-bye or 
" saccharine subsequently." This is one of 
the peculiarities of the "infinitesimal" prac- 
titioners: they never like to relieve a patient 
too soon, as they say, for they wish to allow 
the symptoms to become fully developed in 
order to understand the true nature of the 
disease. Now if you saw a monkey with a 
lighted torch going toward an open powder- 
mill, or a bull going into a china shop, you 
should not interfere, but wait patiently until 
matters have fully developed. Of course, in 
all cases of intense pain, the first indication 
is to give an anodyne and relieve the patient 
as quickly as possible. 

Speaking of " pathies," let us not confine 
ourselves to any "pathy." A plague on all 
your "pathies!" But if we were inclined to 
adopt a " pathy," probably the term "euro- 
path " would be the best of all — that is, use 
anything to cure your patient as speedily as 
possible, no matter from whence it comes. 

The question has been asked: What is 
scientific medicine? In reply we might say, 
in practicing scientific medicine we base our 
diagnosis on a thorough knowledge of path- 
ology and the various sciences which it in- 
volves. The therapeutics is according to the

result of long experience, founded on facts 
and proven by numerous tables of statistics. 
According to the founder of the "mild 
power" system, the totality of symptoms 
alone constitutes the disease, which he says is 
not caused by any material substance; the 
greater number of diseases, it is claimed, are 
of spiritual origin — their cause is not per- 
ceptible to the senses. 

These people at this time made the asser- 
tion that the itch was at the root of all 
chronic diseases — "psora," — and after twelve 
years of investigation decided upon the anti- 
psoric remedies for chronic inflammations. 
This peculiar unpleasantness, caused by the 
" sarcoptes hominis" is sometimes called the 
"Scotch fiddle." Sulphur externally and 
internally is the remedy which will give re- 
lief in a few hours. 

What they call " provings " — symptoms 
caused by drugs in healthy persons — consti- 
tute a large part of their literature; the remedy 
for a disease is that which will produce the 
symptoms in health, hence their " Similia 
similibus curantur" Pathology is ignored 
entirely, for they are concerned mainly with 
medicine. A large encyclopedia, devoted 
exclusively to "provings," is published by 
a Professor Timothy Allen, of New York. 

"Potentizing" is the theory that medicines 
become more powerful as they become more 
attenuated or diluted. A certain Frenchman 
is said to have treated diseases with the most 
happy results by causing the patient to hold 
a bottle of medicine in the closed hand. 

Another of their methods is called "olfac- 
tion;" that is, the patient merely smells the 
medicine. 

To go still farther, a Frenchman by the 
name of Jahr published a work containing 
remedies for the various moral affections: 
thus for la melancholie noire, arsenic; la mel- 
ancholie d&gt;uce, hellebore; la mela?icholie re- 
ligeuse, gold; for silence, ignatia; for a desire 
.to drown, a globule of Pulsatilla; for ill 
humor, aconite; for contemptuousness, ipe- 
cac; for desire to criticise — disposition a 
/aire des reproches, a critiquer — belladonna 
and veratrum; for amour malheureux, hyoscy- 
amus, ignatia, phosphorus; and agaric for a 
disposition to make verses. He gives a case of 
a disconsolate lover who in ten days was " po- 
tentized" into a state of felicitous indifference. 

Of late years many of these men have 
partly adopted pathology and scientific med- 
icine, but they still profess to adhere to their 
"potencies" and "attenuations;" that is, 
their treatment is still immaterial or spiritual. 
This is done probably to pander to the super- 
stition of certain people who are unaccounta- 
bly inclined to favor the " mild power " cure, 



and also from a lack of knowledge of any- 
thing better. It has always seemed strange 
that these men do not drink wine and feed 
themselves according to their theory of "po- 
tentizing" and attenuation. Now, underly- 
ing all this system, as we have seen, was the 
idea that the causes of disease were impal- 
pable or immaterial, that is, spiritual, and this 
great foundation was merely imaginary and 
entirely unreasonable. 

Modern medicine is doing some of its best 
work in showing the material and visible 
character of the cause of many of the com- 
monest diseases, and suggests this in many 
cases where it has not yet been demonstrated. 
How many living germs may be seen under 
the microscope, and how easily we can take 
a portion of any of these poisons on the point 
of a lancet and insert it under the skin to 
produce its peculiar disease ! The germ can 
be preserved or destroyed, and thus disease 
may be propagated or prevented. 

With respect to spiritualism: alcohol, which 
destroys the liver and kidneys when used to 
excess, is not taken in immaterial doses, but 
in large quantities, diligently repeated, even 
by men of the "potentizing" school. Very 
true, these individuals have done some good 
by departing from the common lines of medi- 
cine and disturbing and discrediting indefens- 
ible modes of practice; but they entirely 
missed the right conclusion in this system of 
negation, and although they despised Nature 
they unintentionally showed what Nature 
could do. The father of "infinitesimalism " 
never kept a record of cases, which was one 
of his weak points, and he considered Nature 
a bad doctor. Fleischmann, of Vienna, who 
was a "potentizer," treated twenty-one cases 
of acute pneumonia, with one death, but this 
result was entirely eclipsed by Doctor Hughes 
Bennett, who during a period of sixteen years 
treated a hundred and five cases of acute 
pneumonia with only one death. 

By leaving cases to Nature we were eman- 
cipated from the old traditional methods of 
treatment. We all have our "placebo" and 
something to amuse the patient when no 
medicine is required, and all well educated 
physicians fully understand the importance of 
controlling the patient and inspiring him with 
confidence. 

Finally, since all these fine theories of the 
immaterial, dynamic and spiritual origin of 
disease have been exploded by the revela- 
tions of modern pathology, their demolition 
only completes that of the therapeutical theo- 
ries which rested upon this absurd imaginary 
foundation.

PROFESSOR THOMAS HENRY HUXLEY. 

This well known scientist died at East- 
bourne, England, June 29th. He was by 
long odds the most distinguished member of 
the medical profession of this or any other 
century, and his loss to the scientific world 
cannot be computed by words. 

We abstract from The Lancet (London) the 
following as in a measure supplementary to 
a more complete history to be found in our 
Progress columns: 

With the death of Professor Huxley there passes 
away a man of robust mind and great intellectual 
power and intrepidity, an original and independent 
thinker, and a master of vigorous, masculine Eng- 
lish, as well as a man of very wide range of thought, 
varied attainments, and rare learning. He was 
one of the most conspicuous figures of the latter 
half of this century in science, literature, phil- 
osophy, metaphysics, and education. Any contri- 
bution bearing his name was always read with 
avidity, because he wrote both vigorously and 
tersely, was singularly happy in his use of illus- 
trations, with the additional charm of touches here 
and there of wit and humor and an occasional dash 
of poetry and pathos that afforded glimpses of the 
broad sympathies and pitifulness of his deeper 
nature. Apart from the scientific work he had ac- 
complished, and the reputation he had won from 
the special jury of science, these qualities, and the 
generous, enlightened, and fearless character of 
his writings, made him a leader of popular thought 
and a reformer of popular misconceptions. As a 
strong swimmer, confident in his own powers, 
plunges into the stream and finds a pleasurable 
exercise in breasting the tide, so did Huxley love 
to sound the depths and encounter the difficulties 
of a controversial or abstruse subject. Some writers, 
like the late John Stuart Mill, have dwelt upon the 
mergence of individual character in a dead level of 
uniformity as the bane of modern civilization: the

mscientiously thought to be the li^ht 
and reason- Nature had endowed him with ^reat 
gifts, and Ik- bestowed them on his fell 
with an Open palm. &lt; &gt;n his sacrifices and laborious 

ions in the cause of science, and on the bold 
and striking generalizations and the achievements I 
he accomplished in that field, there Is no need to I 
dwell here, for these have been univ&lt; 
nized by his friends and foes alike. As an educa- I 
tional lecturer he was admirable; his scientific 
knowledge and tone were as conspicuous as was " 
his easy and lucid exposition, and, as we have 
said, his use of illustrations was always specially 
happy in that they really did illustrate what he 
was elucidating or describing. His writings are 
models in their way, so transparently clear that 
the reader can see to the bottom of the deepest 
subject, because their author had himself pene- 
trated those depths and previously examined and 
ascertained the meaning underlying the phenomena 
he was describing Not only had Huxley genius, 
but he had cultivated Nature's rich soil with rare 
assiduity; he was an excellent classic, a modern 
linguist, a draughtsman, and a highly cultured 
man. And it may be confidently asserted that he 
exercised his powers with a dominating love of 
truth for its own sake, and an abiding sense of re- 
sponsibility. As he has himself told us, he held 
the conviction that there was no alleviation for the 
sufferings of mankind except veracity of thought 
and action. It was this conviction that made him 
try to promote the increase of natural knowledge 
and encourage the application of scientific methods 
of investigation to all the problems of life. Huxley 
belonged to his- generation and mankind. The 
news about a change of government and a pend- 
ing election, and the list of titular honors and dis- 
tinctions conferred by the outgoing government, 
which appeared in the papers contemporaneously 
with an obituary notice of the Right Honorable T. 
H. Huxley, will be obliterated from the memory 
like a last year's almanac, but his name will al- 
ways remain on the scroll of fame of the Victorian 
age.

Society and the Philadelphia Polyclinic, be- 
cause of employment of the adjective " irreg- 
ular/' It is taken for granted apparently 
that the term is intended to apply exclusively 
to so-called " eclectics" and " homoeopaths," 
chiefly the former — an assumption which, it is 
perhaps needless to remark, is in great degree 
gratuitous. 

Candidly, at this period of the world's his- 
tory and the advanced status of education, 
we see no occasion for invidious doctrinal 
and class distinctions among upright and con- 
scientious practitioners of medicine. There 
are many in both eclectic and homoeopathic 
ranks just as capable, intelligent and ad- 
vanced as the best; there are homoeopathic 
schools that, in the character of instruction 
given and the general facilities afforded for 
thorough medical education, are unsurpassed 
by any medical institution on the continent 
of America; likewise eclectic institutions 
equally as effective. In spite of the captious 
jealousies and the dissensions constantly be- 
ing sowed by ''small souls," medical science 
is too broad and of too great moment to be 
hampered by petty quarrels over matters that 
are, at best, of no special import, arising as 
they do from personal belief and individ- 
ual conscience. We believe the profession 
at large is willing to accord the title of " reg- 
ular " to any individual who seeks to deserve 
the same and has received a thorough med- 
ical education; perfect professional affiliation 
has already been granted in a vast number 
of instances. But! — Just so long as the up- 
holders of two branches of medicine insist 
upon their own sectarianism by means of the 
words "eclectic" and "homoeopath," and, so 
to speak, "trade" upon these titles; and just 
so long as they insist upon applying to other 
medical men the term " allopath " — a word 
coined by the " homoeopaths " and adopted by 
the " eclectics " as a term of reproach and 
revilement — just so long they will foster dog- 
matism, intolerance, a non-scientific spirit, 
and clog the wheels of medical progress. 
Per contra, the medical profession at large 
applies no titles to these two branches which 
they have not themselves adopted or to a cer- 
tain extent justified by their own enunciation 
as a class distinction. 

However suitable " eclectic " and " homoeo- 
path" may have been in the early evolution 



of these branches of medicine, the fact now 
remains that both are equally as great misfits 
astheterm "allopath;" that neither "homoeo- 
paths " nor " eclectics " deal with medicine as 
an entity, or admit the scientific axiom that 
"the whole is greater than any of its parts." 

It cannot be denied that the "regulars" 
are likewise to blame in that the more narrow- 
minded ignore that charity which should be 
given to all, and foster differences in the 
vilest spirit of trade-unionism. At the same 
time, if "homoeopaths" and "eclectics" 
will insist upon a trademark medicine, and 
the misuse of the term "allopath," just so 
long these exclusives court from the rest 
of the medical profession the same scant 
courtesy which they themselves afford; but 
should they choose to drop the trademark 
and enroll themselves simply as practitioners 
and exponents of medicine, the limit of rec- 
ognition and affiliation must be measured 
by honor, honesty, and truth. The Episco- 
palian does not deny affiliation because of 
individual belief in matters of faith, neither 
does the Presbyterian pass his time abusing 
the creed of the Congregationalist, but in all 
denominations matters of creed are swept 
aside and forgotten under the broad designa- 
tion of Christianity. So, too, the creed of 
"homoeopaths," "eclectics" or "regulars" 
may and should be sunk in the interests of 
medicine as a whole, and of making it a sci- 
entific calling purely. It certainly is not in- 
cumbent upon any medical man to enter upon 
a warfare of abuse, crimination and insult 
against those who chance to differ from him 
in matters of belief and conscience; it is 
demanded by the very nature of his calling 
that he minister to the best of his individual 
ability to the needs of the ill and afflicted, 
and at the same time sink all personalities for 
the benefit of humanity at large. 

Finally, we have not the slightest sympathy 
with any individual, regardless of professional 
affiliations, who insists upon, so to speak, car- 
rying a "chip on his shoulder," nor with him 
who constantly prates and howls for cour- 
tesy and recognition which he is not himself 
equally willing to extend to others. We are, 
however, glad to believe that these faults are 
more in the seeming than in reality, for the 
instances are by no means isolated wherein 
"eclectics" and " homoeopaths" have sought

and quarrels that are beneath the considera- 
tion of any devotee of science. Captious 
fault-finding, backbiting and reviling tend 
neither to conversion or to the healing of 
any breach that arises; especially it does not 
in the least tend to uplift the dignity of the 
profession. It is a simple matter of justice, 
universal in application, that all who carry 
on their profession to the fullest extent in 
the interest of truth, honor and charity are 
entitled to recognition as brethren. When 
this greatly-to-be-desired medical millennium 
shall have been reached, the terms " regular " 
and " irregular" will have no weight save as 
a distinction between the scientific practi- 
tioner and the charlatan, the honest man and 
the knave. 



NUCLEIN IN THERAPEUTICS. 

( )f all the organic remedies which have 
been put forth, none seems to have so well 
sustained the expectations of its originator 
as Yaughan's Nuclein. Strange to say, very 
little negative evidence thus far has been 
adduced regarding this medicament; on the 
contrary, nothing but praise of its action 
emanates from all sources — in septic dis- 
eases, notably diphtheria, scarlatina, etc., and 
likewise in phthisis, cancer, etc., and certain 
forms of paralysis arising from lack of nerve- 
nutrition. 

Doctor McClintock, of Ann Arbor, asserts 
that in addition to the valuable germicidal 
power of Nuclein it has been thoroughly 
demonstrated that it is a valuable antitoxic. 

Doctor John Aulde, editor of the American 
Therapist? concludes a paper upon Nuclein 
as follows:

lar substance which likewise possessed powerful 
antiseptic properties. Then, acting upon the sug- 
gestion furnished by the work ■• nchmen in 
attempting to extract an antiseptic substance from 
the white blood-corpuscles found in pus. I 
ceeded to extract an antiseptic from these bodiet 
while in a state of health, believing that when found * 
as an accompaniment of pus their valuable proper- 
ties must be lost or seriously impaired. He then 
reasoned that if the white corpuscles, while in a 
state of health, were able to give a product whicb 
would arrest the multiplication of micro-organisms, 
it was not unlikely that glands which are supposed 
to be intimately connected with the development of 
these cells might also possess these properties in a 
perceptible degree. As a further step in his dem- 
onstrations, he determined to inoculate animals 
with tuberculous sputum solutions and use these 
antiseptic substances for the purpose of preventing 
the development of tuberculosis. And at every 
step he was rewarded with success. These sub- 
stances he has designated Nucleins, for want of a 
better name, and they are described as phosphorized 
proteids. They are probably the "defensive pro- 
teids" which have so long been assumed to exist is 
the human economy. 

It would be superfluous to say more regard- 
ing the remedy which has already been before 
the public for some months and, as has al- 
ready been remarked, gives such satisfaction 
as to be an earnest of its value in therapeu- 
tics for the future. Doctor Aulde especially 
speaks of its value in malaria, anaemia, rheu- 
matoid arthritis, uterine hyperplasia, neuras- 
thenia, etc.

THE INDEX MEDICUS. 

In another column will be found an editor- 
ial from the New York Medical Journal anent 
the untimely demise of the Index Medicus. 

To those who are especially interested in 
the continuation of this publication, we 
recommend the plan outlined. The great 
trouble, however, with all such is that each

and every individual is apt to wait for his 
neighbor or some one else to make the first 
move. If there are enough medical men in 
the United States sufficiently public-spirited 
to contribute materially toward the revival 
of the Index Medicus, there is little doubt 
that the publisher can be persuaded to again 
undertake the task. The Medical Age 
would therefore suggest that all who are in- 
clined to contribute, immediately send their 
checks to the Index Medicus, George S. Davis 
(P. O. Box 470), Detroit, with the precise 
understanding that if the Index is not revived 
within a reasonable time their remittances 
will be returned. 

This is a matter that admits of no delay; 
and if the journal is to be perpetuated, meas- 
ures looking thereto must be speedily taken. 

It is, of course, hard to judge of the edi- 
torial work on such a publication as the Index 
Medicus, nevertheless in this connection there 
is no harm in making the suggestion that in 
case this periodical is revived, some changes 
be made therein. There is every reason to 
believe the value of such a publication can 
be greatly enhanced by more careful and 
thorough indexing of medical subjects, and 
by cross-indexing. It is desirable that, be- 
sides the title of a paper, all the contained 
subject-matter be indexed. There are few 
papers to-day that do not more or less ap- 
proach subjects outside of the given title, 
and in such cross indexing would be of great 
value — especially is this true where compari- 
sons are made, deductions drawn, or special 
remedies indicated. Indeed, it would seem 
desirable that whenever a remedy is men- 
tioned it should be indexed in the department 
of Materia Medica and Therapeutics. 

We sincerely trust the Index Medicus will 
be revived. As Nature (London) remarks: 
"It will be hardly to the credit of medical 
societies, and scientific workers generally, if 
this indispensable monthly index is allowed 
to come to an end for want of something like 
$2,000 a year ! " 



we should have mentioned also that in the 
presence of Bright's disease, particularly 
when well advanced, Elaterium often loses 
its efficacy, and indeed at times appears 
practically inert. It is in the earlier stages 
of the malady that this drug is apt to prove 
of greatest benefit. 



EDITORIAL NOTES. 



ELATERIUM AND BRIGHT'S DISEASE. 

In a former issue of The Medical Age 
we had occasion to remark upon morbus 
Brightii, mentioning Elaterium as, perhaps, 
one of the best of purgatives. Incidentally 



The Index Medicus.— 

"It is difficult to express adequately the 
regret that is felt in the medical profession 
at the Index s suspension. The trouble seems 
to be that this feeling, although acute, is 
confined to too small a number of individuals 
who feel themselves able to assist in re-estab- 
lishing the publication. Now and then it 
comes to our knowledge that a public-spirited 
person is willing to contribute materially to 
make good the deficiency in the income from 
subscriptions to that incomparable publica- 
tion; in particular, it was with great pleasure 
that we lately received from Doctor Charles 
E. Sajous, of Philadelphia, now sojourning 
in Paris, the following letter: 

The early discontinuance of the Index Medicus is 
announced — a misfortune that every true Ameri- 
can should deplore, a calamity to the professional 
world. If the physicians of the United States but 
knew what that noble publication has done and is 
doing for their country abroad, they would hardly 
permit it to die for the want of the few dollars it 
needs to continue its existence. Two hundred 
volunteers at twenty-five dollars a year each would 
still save it; they are surely to be found among the 
thousands of professional men who during a war 
would gladly offer their services to their country. 
The demise of the Index Medicus would brand the 
American flag with a stain. Who is going to per- 
mit it? Please find enclosed my check for twenty- 
five dollars. 

" Doctor Sajous's check, drawn to the order 
of the editor of this journal, has been endorsed 
to Mr. Davis, who was the publisher of the 
Index Medicus, and transmitted to him. We 
hope that many will be found willing to fol- 
low Doctor Sajous's example, and that thus 
the publication may be resumed. It seems 
well to suggest that those who are disposed 
to aid in the proposed movement should 
communicate directly with Mr. Davis. In 
saying this we are taking it for granted that 
that gentleman is willing to take charge of

Anhalonlum Lewinii.— 

A communication from the Department of 
Agriculture to the editor of The Medical 
states this drug has "remarkable toxic 
properties," the effects produced upon the 
system resembling somewhat those induced 
by the resinous body of Indian hemp. 

The Secretary of the Department declares 
that physiological experiments carried on 
under the direction of the Department 
Chemist revealed the fact that this drug pro- 
duces intoxication of an exhilarating kind, 
the patient seeing beautiful visions and ex- 
periencing exalted emotions. No deleteri- 
ous after-effects were noted, nor were there 
any derangements of functional activity of the 
body except those manifested upon the brain. 

Two alkaloids have been extracted from 
the plant, together with a considerable quan- 
tity of resinous material, the exact nature of 
which has not yet been determined. The 
Washington Post and New York Sun have 
published a sensational account of this drug 
under the title, "Gay Mental Fireworks Seen 
by the Men who Took Muscale as an Experi- 
ment."

Modern Medical Works. — 

There is an element that must be consid- 
eredt»n connection with modern encyclopedic 
medical literature. Publishing firms do not 
find it profitable to pay for first-class author- 
ships, and are constrained to admit articles 
from inexperienced but inordinately bump- 
tious young men, who thus inflict upon an 
unsuspecting medical public a raft of scaf- 
folded and stilted theoretical clap-trap in lieu 
of reliable practical information. That these 
articles have just a sufficiency of well worded 
and authentic truth or authentic observation 
to delude the reader and to give to the whole 
the semblance of being the result of studied 
and well weighed information, makes these 
articles more useless for any real practical 
purposes, as well as dangerous to the inexpe- 
rienced, who are apt to place too much re- 
liance upon the utterances therein contained. 
Often these encyclopedic works are burdened 
and padded out to great bulk and to the great- 
est possible number of volumes. — National 
Popular Review* 

The Hedical Millennium.— 

Really scientific medical societies are need- 
ed; not gatherings where a clique of men

.occasionally display their superior skill and 
ability to a crowd of admirers, and where the 
i attempt of an outsider to develop a thought 
[or present an idea is met with glacial atmos- 
phere, but really scientific societies at which 
[everything is lost sight of save the progress 
iof medicine. 

To such a society the sole conditions of 
membership would be the possession of a 
igood character and a diploma from a repu- 
table medical college, whatever the nature of 
! its teaching. If we do not agree with a man's 
Iviews, we cannot convert him by calling him 
a fool. Let us take him into our midst and 
argue the matter. If we are so positive we 
iare right, it is incumbent upon us to endeavor 
[to convince him, and he, in turn, will shed 
light upon our own paths, for the truth lurks 
in a ure a mediocritas. — Medical Brief. 

(Newspaper Reports of Prolificness. — 

According to a report much republished of 
late in the newspapers, a certain couple called 
Mr. and Mrs. George G. Danville, a farmer 
\ and wife said to be living near Yankton, 
South Dakota, had twenty-seven children, all 
I born in triplets, the oldest being less than 
! thirteen years old. Having had some experi- 
ence of the falsity of such reports, we wrote 
to a reputable physician of Yankton, who in- 
vestigated the story and reported that no such 
persons live or ever have lived in the county. 
Twenty-eight letters for "Mr. Danville" are 
lying unclaimed in the Yankton postoffice. 
One wonders what motives inspire the news- 
paper reporters in periodically starting such 
stories on their rounds. The custom shows 
how skeptical medical writers and statisti- 
cians must be in repeating these concoctions 
of the vivid reportorial brain. — Medical News. 

The Empty Capsule.— 

This invention constitutes a specific boon 
to therapeutics, inasmuch as it offers oppor- 
tunity to bring remedies in powdered form 
into direct contact with the secretions of the 
stomach. In this regard it is superior to the 
solid capsule, whether of the hard or soft 
variety, since the junction of the two halves 
offers a point d'appui for the gastric juices 
whereby the capsule is readily softened at its 
edge, causing it to curl backward and speed- 
ily release the medicament. 

A Century of Married Life — 

We speak of a silver wedding, gold wed- 
ding, and diamond wedding; but what shall 
we call the celebration of the completion of 
one hundred years of married life? Such a 
term is needed now, for Hungarian papers 
chronicle such an event as having occurred 



in the village of Zsombolga, where this im- 
mortal couple of the combined age of 233 
years flourished. Long live Johann Szath- 
mary and Madame ! — Western Druggist. 

Aged Practitioners. — 

Doctor W. Farrier, of Biddeford, Maine, is 
in active practice at the age of ninety-eight, 
and visits his patients on a bicycle. He 
attributes his exceptional vigor to the use of 
wintergreen tea. 

In the same State Doctor Baynes, of Rock- 
land, is still practicing at the age of ninety- 
nine; his teeth are almost perfect and his 
sight excellent. 

Pneumonia. — 

Osier must have had an unfortunate expe- 
rience in the treatment of pneumonia to have 
reached the conclusion that it is a self-limited 
disease, not influenced by medicine and not 
cut short by any means at our command. 
Such has not been the general experience of 
our profession. — New York Medical Times. 

A Buried City.— 

An unknown city like that of Pompeii is 
being excavated in Central America, at the 
foot of Volcano Aqua. Pottery, fine glass- 
ware, jewels, flint instruments, and skeletons 
over six feet long, have been taken out from 
depths of fourteen to eighteen feet. — Medical 
Times. 

Cleanliness Next to Godliness.— 

Doctor Joseph Price says he has done one 
hundred abdominal sections consecutively 
without a coated tongue and without a pulse 
above one hundred, except in cases that bled. 
This was done by clean surgery, without 
chemicals of any character. — Medical Times. 

Death and the Bicycle.— 

Sudden deaths of aged bicyclists from 
heart disease are beginning to be reported. 
Aged people, and those who are affected 
with heart disease, should not indulge in this 
exercise. — Gaillard's Medical Journal. 

Accident to a Physician.— 

Doctor Ed. R. Palmer, of Louisville, suf- 
fered a fall from his bicycle on July 5th, 
which caused his death on the day succeed- 
ing. It seems his head struck the curb, and 
the base of the skull was fractured.

Of a size so convenient that it may be carried 
afield in the pocket, it is an especially desir- 
able adjunct for the working naturalist; at 
the same time it is a volume that will attract 
even the youngest members of the household. 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 



441 



Though from its title it would seem that 
[its bird histories are restricted to Eastern 
North America, the fact remains that there 
are very few species in the length and 
breadth of the Continent that are not repre- 
sented. In addition there is a complete key, 
with description of plumages, nests, eggs, dis- 
tribution, and migration. The introductory 
chapter is a very complete epitome of orni- 
thological science, and withal so concise that 
lit can be mastered within a very brief period 
of time; hence it is possible for the youngest 
to learn without difficulty how to identify 
birds and collect skins, nests, and eggs. 

Notably the illustrations are unequaled by 
any work of like scope, and many give evi- 
dence of having been taken photographically 
from life, being reproduced in half-tone; in- 
deed, so excellent is the work in this respect 
that the coloring of the plates would have 
been a work of supererogation. Another 
notable feature is the chart of colors, which 
is of very material aid when it comes to iden- 
tifying species and genera. 

We cannot speak too highly of this vol- 
ume, which deserves a place in every house- 
hold; its universal circulation will tend more 
than any other one means to the preservation 
of those attractive creatures of woodland and 
field which are the delight of all true lovers 
of nature. 



Beside the Bonnie Briar Bush. By Ian Maclaren. 
Cloth; i6mo; pp. 322. Price, $1.25. Dodd, Mead 
&amp; Co., New York. 

No book of modern times has created such 
a furor; no book has so universally touched 
the tender chords of the hearts of the people; 
despite its many Scotticisms, it appeals to 
each and every one. Manifestly each char- 
acter depicted is a portrait — in no other way 
could such a work have been written. There 
has never been anything to compare with the 
sketch of William Maclure, the country doc- 
tor who gave a life of skill and sacrifice to a 
|&gt;' rural Scottish community; and perhaps no- 
where else, but in Scotland, could such a life 
1 be found. The work as a whole is a true 
I interpretation of the real inner spirit of life 
B in Scotland. Although a collectiou of tales, 
there is a connection between them all; the 
same characters appear and reappear; and 
for humor, pathos, and rare intermingling of 
: - Scotch wit and comedy, the like has never 
been seen. At one moment the reader, in 
spite of himself, is moved to tears; at the 
1 next he has a glimpse of profound logic and 
of tenacious Calvinistic theology; a little later 
is delighted with that peculiar dry pawkie 
wit which constitutes Scottish humor. The 
author is a great master in pathos; and 



no one, not even Sir Walter, justly dubbed 
"The Wizard of the North," is superior to 
Ian Maclaren in this respect. Of the attrac- 
tiveness of the volume it need only be said it 
is one of the works which, when perused to 
finis, will, in a majority of instances, cause 
the reader to return to the initial chapter and 
peruse it again — a test that is borne by but 
few volumes. We would like if every man, 
woman and child could read this production, 
since it will be impossible to enjoy its pages 
without drawing therefrom decided moral 
and mental benefit. 



Ord's Zoology. By Samuel N. Rhodes. Cloth; 
8vo; pp 90. Published by the Editor, at Had- 
donfield, N. J. 

This is an exact reproduction of the part 
originally compiled by Mr. Ord for Johnson 
&amp; Warner, and published by them in Guthrie's 
Geography in 1815. It is, moreover, taken 
from Mr. Ord's private annotated copy, to 
which is added an appendix on the more 
important scientific and historical questions 
involved. 

The history of the second American edi- 
tion of Guthrie's Geography is involved in 
strange obscurity. Of the Johnson &amp; Warner 
edition of 1820 but one copy appears to be 
in existence. Moreover, there is but one copy 
of the third edition in four of the most im- 
portant libraries in the United States, and a 
half-copy of the first edition. The Carey 
quarto edition, however, is not so rare. 

Apart from its technical value, this work 
possesses great historical and literary interest. 
George Ord was a contemporary and asso- 
ciate of Alexander Wilson, and his Zoology 
of North America is, for its extent, by far 
the most accurate which has ever appeared. 
All naturalists owe Mr. Rhoads an immeasur- 
able debt for placing within their reach a 
copy of this extremely rare work, one that is 
of untold practical value.

This volume covers a field of paramount 
importance in medicine. Nervous disorders 
and diseases are the natural accompaniment 
of so-called modern civilization, and have 
been observed for many years to be con- 
stantly increasing, particularly in communi- 
ties where social luxuries abound. The 
limitation of this treatise to the nervous dis- 
eases of children is of special advantage, and 
there are included all those maladies which 
occur frequently during early life and that 
at this period manifest distinctive features. 
Such a work has long been a desideratum, 
for while the nervous affections of adults 
have received thorough attention the rela- 
tions of the same«to the young have obtained 
little of that regard which they undoubtedly 
deserve; and Doctor Sachs has performed 
the task in a most thorough, practical, and 
withal concise, manner. A notable feature 
is the number and excellence of the illustra- 
tions, one hundred and seventy in all. 



Pathology and Treatment of Diseases of the 
Skin. By Doctor Moriz Kaposi. Cloth; 8vo; 
pp. 684. Price, $5.50. William Wood &amp; Co., 
New York. 

This work, which has already reached its 
fourth edition in German, and third edition 
in French, is a recognized text-book through- 
out Europe, and therefore it is not too much 
to expect that it will meet with a high de- 
gree of favor in America. Many points, such 
as the pathology of skin diseases, biology of 
parasites, and inflammation in its various 
stages, which are usually omitted, are here 
treated in a most thorough and comprehen- 
sive manner. As a descriptive writer Doctor 
Kaposi excels, and many of the rarest forms 
of skin disease are depicted wilh most as- 
tounding fidelity to nature. To all English- 



speaking physicians, especially those who 
»nly their own language, this transla- 
tion of a : e and pra

on III. and Lady Sti :re Dc 

Clot; Si. 00. 

This purports to be a true narrative of th&lt; 
most notorious of the many liaisons of N 

III., the heroine being concealed undei 
a rwm deplume. It gives an insight into th&lt; 
true character of the Empress Eugenie such 
as has rarely ever found its way into print. — 
The coldness, the ambition and the plotting 
of this Spanish woman are features rarely 
touched upon by authors. It is stated witl 
positiveness that a son, the result of the liai- 
son with "Lady Stuart," and who was kid- 
napped by the Empress lest he might rob th&lt; 
Prince Imperial of some of the honors desired 
for the latter, is still living, and an officer in 
the British army. The work bears upon «jts 
face the mark of truth, and tallies well with 
the characteristics of Xapoleon III. as we 
know them. 



Remote Consequences of Injuries of the Ni 

By John K. Mitchell, M.D. Cloth; i2mo; pp. 
273. Price, Si. 75. Lea Brothers &amp; Co., Phila- 
delphia. 

Injuries of the nerves are of frequent oc- 
currence in private practice, and often the 
cause of intractable and painful conditions, 
consequently this volume is of especial in- 
terest. Doctor Mitchell has had access to 
hospital records for the last thirty yea. 
well as to government documents, and has 
skillfully utilized his opportunities This 
work will doubtless take a prominent place in- 
medical literature among the special mono- 
graphs which throw light into obscure places 
and contribute to the advance of medical 
science.

of Chastity. By Doctor M. L. Holbrook. Cloth; 
i6mo; pp. 120. Price, $1.00. M. L. Holbrook 
&amp;Co., New York. 

The title of this book probably carries the 
idea of its author, who unfortunately, how- 
ever, is none too familiar with his subject. 
The repetition of well known platitudes, 
without reference to conditions, is valueless; 
neither is a padding with voluminous quota- 
tions in any sense evidence. A lack of physi- 
ological as well as negative argument tends 
to invalidate the volume; the "high ideal" 
of the author can never be reached save 
through thorough scientific weighing of the 
subject in all its phases.

Therapeutic Brevities. 



Santonin. — This is an efficient agent for the 
expulsion of the long round worm. One 
grain given twice daily will be sufficient to 
remove the lumbrici in three or four days; 
! in infants, one-half grain is sufficient. Often 
[the only knowledge we have of the destruc- 
. tion of the worms is the removal of the symp- 
toms, as the parasite is killed and digested. 
In diarrhoea portions of the worms or 
"slime" may appear in quantity. 

For pinworms it should be given in injec- 
tion, as well as small doses by the mouth. 

The wide range of action of Santonin in 
soothing irritability of the intestinal canal, 
and of the nervous system arising from in- 
:testinal irritability, is not generally known; 
nor is it known that its effect upon the nerv- 
|ous system is more important than its virtues 
as an anthelmintic. Many cases are met in 
children where the premonitory symptoms of 
cerebral irritation are strongly marked; or 
there are reflex symptoms of a troublesome 
character, or evidences of gastric, intestinal 
or spinal irritation that are not due to worms. 
These are more promptly overcome by San- 
tonin than by any other drug, if employed in 
small doses— one-tenth grain. In conjunc- 
tion with belladonna in the acute nephritis of 
scarlatina or diphtheria it acts like magic; so 
too in chronic catarrh of bladder, nocturnal 
enuresis, dysuria, and strangury. It is never 
necessary to give more than one grain at a 
dose in these cases, but it should be thor- 
oughly pulverized always. — Medical Times. 



istered Chloroform in at least three-fourths 
of the number, and no ill-effects ever fol- 
lowed. — Medical News. 



Chloroform in Labor. — Doctor Bedford 
Brown declares there has never been re- 
ported more than forty cases of death from 
Chloroform in labor. He has used this agent 
every half-hour for from twenty to forty 
hours without trouble following; has seen 
profound chloroform narcosis lasting for 
three or four hours without grave effects — 
the alteration in the vaso-motor system of a 
pregnant woman enables her to resist the 
toxic action of Chloroform to this wonderful 
extent. He believes that the use of Chloro- 
form in obstetrics is not only justifiable, but 
that it would be inhuman to withhold it. 
It is applicable to any stage in small quan- 
tities. 

To remove rigidity of the cervix or peri- 
neum, considerable more Chloroform is re- 
quired than merely to dull pain; it is only in 
excess that it tends to prevent contractions. 
It certainly does not tend to promote haemor- 
rhage. In 2,000 cases Bedford Brown admin- 



Picrotoxin as an Antisudorific. — Semmola 
and Gioffredi mention a case, in a lady aged 
forty-three, of influenza, which was followed 
during convalescence by profuse perspiration 
after the least exertion, gradually increasing 
until it "poured off in rivulets." There was 
notably sympathetic nervous derangement; 
there was slight systolic murmur at apex, 
and some accentuation of the second sound 
of the heart in the pulmonary area. Atropine, 
agaricine, camphor, gallic acid and other 
antisudorifics were of no avail. Semmola 
concluded the trouble arose from vaso-motor 
paralysis due to the action of some influenzal 
toxin upon the vaso-motor centre in the 
bulb; the presence of dull red patches on the 
skin confirmed the diagnosis. 

Since Picrotoxin has a stimulating action 
on the vaso motor centre, it was prescribed 
to be taken twice daily, in doses of half a 
milligramme, and with most satisfactory re- 
sult. In eight days the hyperidrosis had en- 
tirely disappeared. — Riforma Medica. 



Horse Chestnut. — Eclectics particularly rec- 
ommend this remedy for its influence upon 
the circulatory apparatus, more especially the 
venous system. It renders best service when 
there is capillary blood-stasis, especially of 
the viscera and lower intestinal canal — thus 
it becomes a good remedy for many conges- 
tive troubles. It has also proved to be spe- 
cific in its influence on certain forms of 
haemorrhoids, whether internal or external, 
notably where there is burning, continued 
aching with a sense of fullness, and constant 
desire for evacuation. — Eclectic. 



Staphysagria. — This is one of the most sat- 
isfactory remedies known, in the treatment 
of maladies peculiar to the prostate gland, 
the vesiculae seminales, and the testes. It is 
especially valuable in spermatorrhoea, pros- 
tatorrhcea, chronic gonorrhoea, and gleet. 

Owing to its peculiarly favorable influence 
upon the nervous system, it is likewise an 
excellent remedy for sexual derangement in 
females, particularly when there is depression 
of spirits, despondency, hypochondriasis, hys- 
teria, moroseness, etc. — Medical Times.

tion are extremely rare, and where they do 
occur it is rarer stiil to find them amenable 
to art. In this instance the cure is said to

To Remove Tattoo Marks. — Make a mass, 
the consistency of dough, with salicylic acid 
and glycerin; apply to the tattoo marks, and 
confine with a compress and strips of adhe- 
sive plaster for one week. Then remove the 
layer of epidermis over the marks, and apply 
salicylic acid and glycerin as before. 

It may be necessary to repeat three times, 
but usually the second application removes 
the marks. — Medical Brief . 



Cinnamon in Influenza. — I have tried Cin- 
namon in some fifty cases of this disease, and 
have found it far more useful than quinine. 
I give simply drachm doses of the tincture 
three times a day. At least thirty of my 
cases were benefited, and I generally found 
from the patients' statements that the pains 
in the head and back were relieved after three 
or four doses. — Doctor H. A. Stonham, in

Medical Progress. 



Right Honorable T. H. Huxley, F.R.S., 
ID.C.L ., LL.D., F.R.C.S., etc.— In Professor 
t Huxley, science mourns her most distin- 
guished champion, and the medical profession 
tias lost one of its most illustrious members. 
[His health had been failing for some time, 
and some seven or eight years ago the late 
'Sir Andrew Clark warned him that his heart 
[was in a condition which made his hold on 
[life a frail one. Treatment at Maloja, how- 
ever, by the system of graduated exercise 
lintroduced by Oertel, strengthened the fail- 
ling organ so much that Huxley seemed to 
(have entered on a new lease of life. Four 
or five years ago he pitched his tent at East- 
bourne, almost under the shadow of Beachy 
Head, being attracted to the place not only 
by the bracing air, but by the opportunities 
for gentle hill-climbing offered by the Downs. 
So well did this suit him that until a very few 
months ago his upright carriage and the 
springiness of his step made it difficult to be- 
lieve that his years were already three score 
and ten. 

At the beginning of March he was attacked 
by influenza, with serious lung complications 
which, in the weakened condition of the 
heart, more than once brought him to the 
very verge of death. He rallied so far, how- 
lever, that during the warm weather in the 
early part of May he could be carried down- 
stairs, and he appeared for a time to make 
satisfactory progress. About ten days ago, 
however, a relapse occurred; embolic ne- 
phritis with further cardiac complications 
came on, and he passed away quietly on the 
afternoon of Saturday last, retaining con- 
sciousness almost to the last. The immedi- 
ate cause of death was pulmonary embolism. 
He was confined to his room only a few days, 
having been in his garden for a short time so 
recently as the Tuesday before he died. He 
was attended throughout his illness by Mr. 
H. D. Farnell, F.R.C.S., of Eastbourne, who 
had the advantage of consultations on several 
occasions with Doctor Burney Yeo and once 
with Sir William Roberts, and the assistance 
of the Professor's son, Doctor Henry Huxley. 

As a patient, Professor Huxley was all that 
the ordinary doctor, when himself ill, too 
often is not. From first to last he was per- 
fectly calm, bearing his sufferings without 
complaint, taking a keen scientific interest in 
his own case, but leaving the management of 
it unreservedly in the hands of those who 
had charge of him. His playful humor re- 
mained unsubdued till the end. He jokingly 
warned one of his doctors not to argue with 



him on the physiological aspects of his case 
unless he wished to be "floored," and he 
offered to demonstrate the femur on his own 
emaciated limb. The very Sunday before 
his death he spent some hours in his garden 
delighting those about him with reminiscences 
and anecdotes told with nearly all his old wit 
and felicity of phrase. In one of the crises 
of his illness, when his perfect equanimity 
extorted some remark from his attendants, 
he said that when he was at sea he had some- 
times been awakened by the rolling of the 
ship in rough weather; on hearing the voice 
of the officers on deck, however, he would 
quietly turn over and go to sleep again, with 
the thought that it was their affair, not his. 
In the same spirit, when difficulties arose in 
the conduct of his case, he told his physicians 
to do whatever they thought right, saying: 
"That is your business, not mine." In ex- 
planation of his docility as a patient he would 
say that all through his life he had been 
guided by two principles alone, namely: never 
to tell a lie, great or small; and always to 
obey lawful orders. In a word, Huxley died 
as he had lived, as a philosopher — steadfastly 
carrying out to the end, according to his 
lights, Goethe's precept "Im Ganzen, Guten, 
Wahren resolut zu leben" 

Thomas Henry Huxley was born, as he 
himself has told us, " about eight o'clock in the 
morning on May 4th, 1825, at Ealing, which 
was at that time as quiet a little country vil- 
lage as could be found within half a dozen 
miles of Hyde Park Corner." His father was 
one of the masters "in a large semi-public 
school which at one time had a high reputa- 
tion." Why he was christened Thomas Henry 
he did not know, but he referred to it as a 
curious chance that his parents should have 
fixed for his usual denomination upon the 
name of the particular apostle with whom he 
had always felt most sympathy. Like many 
other remarkable men, he owed much to the 
influence of his mother. In his autobiogra- 
phy he says: "Physically and mentally I am 
the son of my mother, so completely — even 
down to peculiar movements of the hands, 
which made their appearance in me as I 
reached the age she had when I noticed 
them— that I can hardly find any trace of my 
father in myself, except an inborn faculty for 
drawing, which unfortunately in my case has 
never been cultivated, a hot temper, and that 
amount of tenacity of purpose which un- 
friendly observers sometimes call obstinacy." 

His regular school training was of the 
briefest, a circumstance which he himself ac- 
counted fortunate, inasmuch as the society 
he fell into at school was the worst he ever 
knew. The boys were simply left to struggle

particular making a deep impression on him, 

that of the latter work at 
be could not possibly have unde: 
very much. 

rew up his great desire was to be a 
mechanical engineer, but the fates were 
against this, and while very young he com- 
menced the study of medicine under a med- 
trother-in law. He owns that in later 
be was occasionally horrified to think 
how little he ever knew or cared about med- 
icine as the art of healing. The only part of 
urse which really and deeply interested 
him was physiology, "which is the mechan- 
ical engineering of the human body." The 
extraordinary attraction he felt towards the 
study of the intricacies of living structure 
nearly proved fatal to him at the outset. 
When between 13 and 14 years of age he was 
taken by some oLder student friends to the first 
post-mortem examination he ever attended. 
Throughout his life he was "most unfortu- 
nately sensitive to the disagreeables which 
attend anatomical pursuits," but on this oc- 
casion his curiosity overpowered all other 
feelings, and he spent two or three hours in 
gratifying it. He did not cut himself, and 
none of the ordinary symptoms of dissection 
poison supervened, but poisoned he was some- 
how, and he sank into a strange state of 
apathy. He was sent to a farmhouse in War- 
wickshire and soon recovered, but for years 
he suffered from occasional paroxysms of in- 
ternal pain, and from that time, to use his 
own words, his constant friend, hypochon- 
driacal dyspepsia, commenced his half-cen- 
tury of co-tenancy of his fleshly tabernacle. 
As a medical student he worked extremely 
hard when it pleased him, and when it did not 
— "which was a frequent case" — he was, he 
confesses, extremely idle (unless making cari- 
catures of his pastors and masters can be 
called a branch of industry) or else wasted 
his energies in wrong directions. He read 
everything he could lay his hands upon, in- 
cluding novels, and took up all sorts of pur- 
suits, to drop them again as speedily. He 
says: " No doubt it was very largely my own 
fault, but the only instruction from which I 
ever obtained the proper effect of education 
was that which I received from Mr. Wharton 
Jones, who was the lecturer on physiology at 
the Charing Cross School of Medicine. The 
extent and precision of his knowledge im- 
pressed me greatly, and the severe exactness 



of his method of lecturing was quite I 
taste. 1 do not know that I have ever felt so 
much for anybody as a teacher before 

or since. 1 worked hard to obtain his appr 
nation, and he *as extremely kind and hel 
ful to the youngster who, I am afraid, took 
up more of his time than he had any right t 
do. It was he who suggested the publicati 
of my first scientific paper — a very little on 
— in the Medical Gazcttr of 1845, and mo 
kindly corrected the literary faults whic 
abounded in it, short as it was; for at th 
time, and for many years afterwards, I d 
tested the trouble of writing and would tak 
no pains over it." 

In 1845 he passed the first M.B. examina 
tion at the London University, in which h 
obtained honors in physiology, but failed t 
secure the medal, being, as he said in 
speech at University College, "thoroughl 
well beaten" by Doctor Ransom, of Notting- 
ham. In the early spring of 1846, having fin- 
ished his obligatory medical studies, though 
still too young to qualify at the College of 
Surgeons, he was talking to his fellow stu- 
dent, Sir Joseph Fayrer, and wondering what 
he should do to meet the imperative necessity 
for earning his bread. On Fayrer's advice, he 
applied to Sir William Burnett, at that time 
Director-General of the Medical Department 
of the Royal Navy, for an appointment. 
Within a couple of months he was, after pass- 
ing an examination, entered on the books of 
Nelson's old ship, the Victory, for duty at Has- 
lar Hospital. At Haslar Huxley had among 
his messmates the late Sir Andrew Clark — 
whom he speaks of as " my kindest of doc- 
tors " — and two future directors-general of 
the Medical Service of the Navy, Sir Alex- 
ander Armstrong and Sir John Watt Reid. 

When he had been there seven months he 
was appointed to the Rattlesnake, Captain 
Owen Stanley (a brother of Dean Stanley). 
On the Rattlesnake, which was commissioned 
for a survey of New Guinea, the Louisiade 
Archipelago, and the Barrier Reef of Aus- 
tralia, he spent the greater part of the years 
1846-1850, learning valuable lessons as to 
the realities of life, and using to the full the 
opportunities for scientific work the cruise 
afforded. During his four years of absence 
from England he sent home many communi- 
cations to the Linnean Society, "with the 
same result as that obtained by Noah when 
he sent the raven out of his ark." Tiring of 
this unprofitable amusement, he in 1849 sent 
a more elaborate paper to the Royal Society, 
which on his return to England in 1850 he 
found had been published. The next three 
years were occupied by a battle with the 
Admiralty, which, instead of contributing, as

t had partly pledged itself to do, to the ex- 
pense of publishing his scientific work, at last 
Drdered him to join a ship. Huxley there- 
jpon threw up his commission, and looked 
about for a professorship of physiology or 
comparative anatomy. Among other unsuc- 
cessful attempts he mentions that Tyndall 
and he were candidates at the same time for 
the chairs of physics and natural history, 
respectively, in the University of Toronto; 
that seat of learning, however, would have 
none of them. At last, in 1854, on the trans- 
[lation of Edward Forbes to Edinburgh, Sir 
Henry de la Beche, the Director-General of 
the Geological Survey, offered him the post 
of paleontologist and professor of natural 
history in the Royal School of Mines vacated 
by Forbes. He refused the former point 
blank, and accepted the latter only provision- 
ally, telling Sir Henry that he did not care 
for fossils, and that he should give up natural 
history as soon as he could get a physio- 
logical post. "But," he adds, "I held the 
office for thirty-one years, and a large part 
of my work has been paleontological." In 
the same year he was appointed Fullerian 
Professor of Physiology in the Royal Institu- 
tion, and Examiner in Physiology and Com- 
parative Anatomy in the University of Lon- 
don. In 1858 he was Croonian Lecturer to 
the Royal Society, taking for his subject 
"The Theory of the Vertebrate Skull." In 
1863 he became Professor of Comparative 
Anatomy at the Royal College of Surgeons; 
this post he continued to hold till 1869. He 
was elected President of the Geological 
Society in 1869, and of the Ethnological 
Society in 1870. In the latter year he was 
President of the British Association. Two 
or three years later he was chosen Lord 
Rector of Aberdeen, in which capacity he 
delivered an address on " Universities, Actual 
and Ideal," on February 27th, 1874. In 1875— 
76 he acted as substitute in the chair of natural 
history at Edinburgh for Professor Wyville 
Thompson, who was on board the Challenger 
on its famous voyage of scientific exploration. 

Huxley was elected a Fellow of the Royal 
Society in 185 1. In 1873 he was appointed 
its Secretary, and in 1883 he became its 
President in succession to Mr. Spootiswoode. 
The latter post he resigned, together with all 
his other public appointments, in 1885 on 
account of failing health. Moreover, he had 
reached the age at which he used jokingly to 
say that scientific men should be "pole-axed." 

It would be tedious to enumerate all the 
honors of which he was the recipient. He 
was a corresponding member of most of the 
leading scientific societies in Europe and 
America; the Royal College of Surgeons (of 



which he became a Member in 1862) elected 
him a Fellow in 1884; and honorary degrees 
were conferred upon him by the Universities 
of Oxford, Cambridge, Dublin, Edinburgh, 
Wlirzburg, and Breslau. The Royal Society 
awarded him its medal in 1852, and the Geo- 
logical Society gave him the Wollaston Medal 
in 1876. He was a trustee of the British 
Museum, and a member of the Senate of the 
University of London. In 1892 he was sworn 
of the Privy Council, a mark of distinction 
which is still unique as far as scientific men 
are concerned. 

Huxley's work was by no means confined 
to scientific research and teaching. In 1870 
he was elected a member of the first London 
School Board, and he took a very active part 
in its proceedings till his resignation in 1872. 
In 1881 he was appointed Inspector of 
Salmon Fisheries, and continued to discharge 
the duties of that post till ill- health com- 
pelled him to retire in 1885. He served on 
a number of Royal Commissions — on Vivi- 
section, Contagious Diseases, Scottish Uni- 
versities, Fisheries, etc. His last public act 
was when, in introducing the deputation to 
Lord Rosebery on the subject of the pro- 
posed new university for London, on Janu- 
ary 2 2d, he presented the case of the sup- 
porters of the Gresham scheme in a speech 
of great brilliancy and power. 

Space will not allow us to give anything 
like a full bibliography of Huxley's writings. 
His first paper, which, as already said, ap- 
peared in the Medical Gazette in 1845, con ~ 
tained a description of "Huxley's layer" in 
the human hair. In 1849 the Royal Society 
published his paper on the Anatomy and 
Affinities of the Medusae, which had been 
communicated to it on his behalf by the then 
Bishop of Norwich (the father of Captain 
Stanley) on June 21st, 1849. In 1859 ap- 
peared his great work on the Oceanic Hy- 
drozoa, which he had vainly tried to get the 
Admiralty to help in publishing. " My 
Lords," however, did nothing for him beyond 
expressing a gracious hope (which made no 
encroachment on the Navy vote) that the 
work would be creditable to himself and to 
the nation. 

At the meeting of the British Association at 
Oxford in i860 he strenuously defended the 
doctrine of evolution against Bishop Samuel 
Wilberforce and other clerical assailants; a 
summary of this memorable debate is given 
in his Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature, 
published in 1863. In 1864 he published 
Lectures on Comparative Anatomy. In 1866 
appeared his Lessons in Elementary Physi- 
ology, which has run through numerous 
editions, and still holds its place as the best

c rrect the proofs. He was never afterwards 
able to do any literary work. 

In all Huxley's writings the literary quality 
is of the best, his style in its incisiveness, 
strength, directness, and lucidity, being with- 
out an equal in scientific literature. Medical 
writers might with great advantage to them- 
selves and unspeakable comfort to their 
readers take Huxley as a model. His mas- 
tery of style did not, like Dogberry's reading 
and writing, come to him by nature; his 
secret was that no sentence was ever allowed 
to go out of his hands until it had been made as 
perfect as possible, and he has left it on record 
that he thought nothing of writing a page two 
or three times over if by so doing he could ar- 
rive at a clearer expression of his meaning. 

Sir Joseph Fayrer says: 

M It was with profound grief that I heard 
of the death of my old and much respected 
friend. The loss of the foremost biologist of 
this or any other country will be universally 
deplored, for he has for many years had a pre- 
dominant influence on the progress of biolog- 
ical science and the expansion of scientific 
teaching which was not surpassed by even that 
of his friends, Darwin and Tyndall, and has 
contributed beyond all others to the advance- 
ment of natural knowledge and the promotion 
of the scientific methods of investigation of 
the problems of life. To this end, indeed, the 
whole strength of his surpassing intellect was 
steadfastly, through good and evil report, 
devoted, and the results have been recorded 
in language so incisive and convincing as to 
leave on all who have followed his teaching 
the impression of incontrovertible truth, and

" We were fellow-students from 1*44 until 
he joined the Navy in 1S4O, and it was during 
that time that I learnt to recognize his great 
intellectual power and the keen interest he 
took in the physiological lessons of Wl 
Jones and other teachers. It was not sur- 
prising that he took honors at the London 
University, and it was with a feeling of con- 
fidence that I looked forward to a distin- 
guished career for him when he departed with 
Captain Owen Stanley in the Rattlesnake o 
his scientific mission. 

"That he entered the naval service I have 
always felt proud to think was due to my 
persuasion, for after consultation one day I 
urged him to apply to the Director- General 
of the Navy. He did so, and the result was 
an appointment to Haslar, and subsequently 
to the Rattlesnake. Doubtless had he se- 
lected any other career the result would have 
been the same, but as some of his earliest 
contributions to science arose out of the ex- 
pedition to the South Seas, one cannot but re-

the course and direction of his future work.

hoped to be remembered by posterity. 

"But he will be remembered not only as a 
great original thinker, investigator, and pro- 
moter of biological science, but as a man of 
the highest principle and unswerving devo- 
tion to truth, a genial and charming friend, 
a keen but courteous controversialist, and 
one who illuminated all he said or did with 
the brightness of a remarkable personality, 
and a goodness of heart that endeared him to 
all who knew him and now lament his loss."

THE CYSTOSCOPE AND ITS LIMITATIONS 
AS A DIAGNOSTIC AID.* 

BY FREDERICK W. ROBBINS, A.M., M.D. 

In these times, when every effort is being 
expended in perfecting methods of diagnosis 
as well as the technique of operation, the 
genito-urinary organs have not been neg- 
Slected, and in the diagnosis of diseases pe- 
culiar to them ocular demonstration has more 
than ever before become the handmaiden of 
ipalpation and chemical research. 

In the female subject the inspection of the 
bladder has been made very easy by means 
m the simple endoscope of Doctor Howard 
Kelly. Through the endoscope the inspec- 
tion of the mouths of the ureters and catheter- 
Ij.zation of the same, as well as the pelvis of 
|i:he kidneys, as Kelly does it, does not seem 
difficult. As yet no such simple device has 
been produced for the inspection of the male 
bladder, but we find in the cystoscope a very 
lisatisfactory instrument for use in many doubt- 
: ul cases of bladder or kidney disease. 

The cystoscopes at present in use are the 
Bitze, made in Berlin, and the Leiter, made 
In Vienna; modifications of these instru- 
1 nents have been placed on the market, but 
lllll are probably inferior to the two men- 
tioned; and these two are in principle if not 
In fact identical, for they were worked out 
\ :&gt;y Professor Nitze in conjunction with the 
I'nstrument-maker Leiter. The instrument 
ffhich I use was made by Leiter, and differs 
Tom the Nitze mainly in the construction of 
;;he tip which contains the light surrounded 
}y a metallic shield. The lamp is easily re- 
placed when burned out. In the Nitze cys- 
oscope the glass with contained lamp is at

■ty. 



the extreme end of the instrument, and with 
no metallic shield is in all parts surrounded 
by the fluid of the bladder. Many cysto- 
scopists, among them the authority on cysto- 
scopy of this country, Doctor Willy Meyer, 
of New York, use the Nitze instrument 
chiefly on account of several secondary cysto- 
scopes devised by Nitze which in some cases 
are of advantage. 

The cystoscope, like the telescope, was a 
crude instrument at first, but has been im- 
proved from time to time until its present 
state of perfection was reached about five 
years ago. In the tip beneath the crystal 
window is the electric lamp, and near the 
junction of the tip with the shaft is placed a 
prism which sends the rays of light, diminish- 
ing the size of the inverted picture, down the 
shaft to the eye. There is within the tube 
passing to the prism an optical combination 
of lenses called the telescope attachment, 
which gives us a clear, erect, and slightly 
diminished picture of the object looked upon. 
In the Nitze instrument the object is slightly 
magnified. At the ocular end of the instru- 
ment the electric connections are made and 
so arranged that the light can readily be 
turned off or on and the position of the prism 
in the bladder be easily noted. The size of 
the shaft is No. 22 F. 

At times it is an advantage to possess the 
irrigating cystoscope, which is this instrument 
with two tubes through which water can be 
forced into and drawn from the bladder. 
The inlet tube has its opening just back of 
the prism, so that its surface can be irrigated 
by the clear water as it is forced in. 

There have been devised a number of in- 
struments by which attempts were made to 
catheterize the ureters, but all have been fail- 
ures. Doctor Meyer wrote me that there 
had been no improvements of note within 
the last three years, but recently an exten- 
sive article came to my notice in the Berliner

In the use of tin ! essential 

ive the right - attery. The plati- 

num must be brought to a white heat gradu- 
and not too much heat produced, else 
the lamp will be immediately burned out; 
and when the proper amount of light is pro- 
duced there must be no increase or dei 
in its illuminating power. I mention this 
ise I found great annoyance from these 
- in my first attempts at cystoscopy; but 
since supplying myself, at the suggestion of 
Doctor Meyer, with the battery made by the 
New York (ialvano Electric Co., there has 
been no further trouble. 

I do not propose taking time to report 
cases, but will emphasize some of the classes 
of cases in which cystoscopy is an advantage 
or necessity. First, however, we must keep 
in mind three conditions that must be present 
if cystoscopy is to be done with any satisfac- 
tion: The urethra must readily allow the 
entrance of a No. 22 F. instrument: The 
bladder must have a capacity of about five 
fluidounces — this is in accord with the results 
of the experiments of Nitze, which showed 
that this amount of fluid is necessary to dis- 
tend the bladder sufficiently to overcome the 
folds of mucous membrane of the normally 
contracted bladder, and also, as Doctor 
Meyer suggests, one's judgment is apt to be 
much nearer perfect when observations are 
made under similar conditions, for in a blad- 
der so contracted that the capacity is only an 
ounce or two there is not much to be gained 
from cystoscopy, and there is some danger 
of burning the mucous membrane: Finally, 
it must be possible to keep the fluid nearly 
clear for some little time; profuse hematuria, 
for example, always necessitates waiting until 
the haemorrhage has for the time ceased, be- 
fore continuing the exploration. 

Often the cystoscope may be used with 
little or no pain, but it is frequently neces-

cle causing much distress, or diffl 
hypertrophies where the results of operatio: 
have not as yet proved BO satisfactory. 

To one unaccustomed to the use of t 
&gt;cope it is easy to mistake a little fol 
of mucous membrane falling over the e 
trance to the urethra for a tumor, but furth 
experience will remove all doubt in that r&lt; 
spect. After entering well the bladder, it 
desirable to make the examination systemati- 
cally in order not to overlook anything, and 
this is done by carrying the beak directly to 
the fundus and drawing the instrument for 
ward until the urethra shuts off the lig 
from the prism. The superior segment 
about 6o c has been observed, and by repea 
ing the procedure, turning the instrument t 
the right about 6o°, then 120 , and finall 
180 , and so to the left, the entire bladd 
will have been explored. If nothing attrac 
the eye other than a pinkish-gray surfac 
the mucous membrane may be considere 
normal and our attention may be turned 
the ureters, which, as is well known, are see 
at the right and left angles of the trigonu 
the urethra marking the third angle. 

When cystitis of a mild grade is presen 
one may observe the congested vessels n 
unlike the condition observed on a congested

the more severe forms of ulcerative or tuber 
cular inflammation of the mucous membran 
the cystoscopic picture will be that of a dir 
gray surface with tags of pus hanging fro 
it or floating in the water with which 
bladder is filled. 

If there has been an obstruction to the flow 
of urine for some time — as the result of a 
stricture, for example — concentric hypertro- 
phy of the bladder will have taken place, and 
the thickened bundles of muscular fibre can 
be seen projecting through the mucous mem- 
brane, giving a basket like appearance to the 
entire surface. Then, again, the similar con- 
dition termed the sacculated bladder may

"exist, where one or more compartments are 
thrown into shadow, and into these pockets 
twe can thrust the lamp in search of foreign 
bodies which are apt to exist and are easily 
overlooked in this condition. 

A dark spot on the surface of the bladder 
[may on careful observation be seen to be a 
ragged ulcer, possibly covered with phos- 
bhated deposit or a growth tuberculous or 
[malignant. If an ulcer is believed to be 
bresent, the injection of a solution of iodide 
bf potassium into the bladder will prove 
whether there be exfoliation of epithelium, 
because if that be the case in the course of 
fifteen or twenty minutes the characteristic 
reaction of iodine can be obtained from the 
haliva with the starch test. Foreign bodies, 
[is pins, catheters, ligature knots, have been 
bbserved by means of the cystoscope. 

It is often objected that the cystoscope is 
comparatively useless because in most cases 
■here cystoscopy would be performed for 
bladder disease an exploratory incision would 
pave the advantage of allowing a complete 
operation at once if necessary, and would 
be at least beneficial on account of the per- 
fect drainage of the bladder. 

It must be borne in mind that we use the 
Lystoscope for diagnostic purposes, and not 
lis an operative procedure. This instrument 
Kill be allowed when the patient will not sub- 
mit to an exploratory operation, and as a re- 
sult of the examination it is often made clear 
whether an operation shall be made above 
■he pubis, through the perineum, or not at- 
1.11. 

I I would not for a moment desire to be under- 
Itood as wishing to substitute the cystoscope 
"or other means of diagnosis, but, as Doctor 
iVLeyer says, after all has been elicited that 
l:an be concerning a case, the resort to the 
lystoscope is the final act in completing a 
iliagnosis. 

No one is so skilled that his judgment may 
rot be often confirmed or changed by the 

ddition of more light. I have known cases 

yhere small phosphatic stones have been 
■nought before operation to be large calculi, 

.nd perineal section was made, when the 
. ystoscope would have without doubt demon- 

trated the size of the stones and probably 
jheir character so that lithotrity and evacua- 
|ion would have been found all-sufficient. 



Much can often be added to our knowl- 
edge of a bladder trouble by cystoscopy; 
sometimes very little. In suppurative dis- 
ease, usually the bladder can be douched out 
carefully and good vision obtained, but if 
there is present a growth bleeding profusely 
at the slightest touch, or if there is profuse 
haemorrhage from the ureters, vision is soon 
obstructed and the examination is unsatis- 
factory — but even in such cases good results 
may be obtained upon the second examina- 
tion after the patient has had complete rest 
and the bleeding has ceased. 

The irrigating cystoscope I have not used, 
but the experience of others has proven its 
value. 

In many subjects the study of the condi- 
tion of the ureters is of prime importance. 
They pierce the serous and muscular coats, 
and obliquely pass for some distance beneath 
the mucous membrane before entering the 
bladder; there the ureteral sphincter pre- 
vents the urine from trickling into the blad- 
der, but as often as the pressure in the pelvis 
of the kidney and ureter is sufficient the 
sphincter relaxes and the urine enters the 
bladder in little jets. Under different condi- 
tions, of course, these jets would be thrown 
out more or less often, at intervals of from 
twenty to sixty seconds usually, but both 
ureters should discharge their contents at in- 
tervals nearly alike — and When Doctor Meyer 
in one case found the jets from one ureter 
every thirty seconds and from its opposite 
every three minutes, he at once concluded 
that the secreting power of one kidney was 
much less than that of the other. It should 
also be noted whether the jet of urine is clear. 
In some cases of pyelitis, worm-like masses 
have been seen passing out from the ureters. 

As in urethritis the meatus is red and 
swollen, so a similar condition may be seen 
at the mouth of a ureter leading to an in- 
flamed kidney. Parting and prolapse of the 
ureter is not a very uncommon condition. 
The trigonum must be carefully examined 
for conditions secondary to kidney affections, 
for tubercular or other disease is apt to 
extend to contiguous parts. Evidences of 
severe disease of one kidney and of the cor- 
responding ureter, while the other ureter and 
its surroundings appear healthy, would place 
the surgeon in a position to operate boldly.

QONORRH(EAL CONJUNCTIVITIS.* 

N If. I IMPBEL1 , M.D., L.R.C.S (EDIN.). 

This subject is one of the few upon which 
the general practitioner and the specialist 
can meet on common ground, and each feel 
equally at home. Moreover, it is a subject 
in which all public-minded citizens, whether 
professional or of the laity, should be and 
often are deeply interested. — I would like to 
say further in this connection that such com- 
mon grounds of thought should be more 
assiduously cultivated. The strong leaning 
of medicine at this day and in this genera- 
tion is toward specialism, and, while this is 
good and beneficial to a certain extent, in 
my opinion it frequently goes too far; 
specialists, exhibit a tendency to become 
more and more exclusive, while the general 
practitioners are more and more alienated. 
Both thereby, undoubtedly, lose a great deal, 
and the former perhaps more than the latter, 
because they, as a class, need the broadening 
influence of minds possessed of extended 
and varied experience such as falls to the 
lot of the general practitioner or "family 
doctor" alone. 

lorrhceal conjunctivitisisa vital subject, 
one in which opthalmology has made decided 
advances and can show considerable improve- 
ments in results. It is not only engaging 
the minds of professional men, but has been 
brought to the observation of legislative 
bodies, and with beneficent results. Further, 
it is a disease that, more than any other, is 
responsible for the large number of blind, 
partially blind and deformed eyes with which 
our eleemosynary institutions are to-day filled:

inoth that, to a greater 

extent than any other, incapacitates 

tuns— denies them the light of heave 
removes from them t:. m : to secure an 

able living. What will be 
said when I assert that twenty-five to thirty 
ent. of the blind people of the I'nited 
States are in their deplorable condi: 
to the ravages of this that in the 

French Republic there are 40,000 blind, of 
whom iS.ooo (nearly fifty per cent.) are 
claimed as victims to gonorrheal ophthal- 
mia' To this may be added the undoubted 
fact that this is a filth disease — that it arises 
from vice and the unchaste and unclear 
ual lives of its victims or their progenitors; 
that it is largely preventable and almost 
wholly controllable ! Thus it will appear we 
are treading upon very important and inter- 
esting ground. 

Purulent ophthalmia may be defined 
acute specific infectious malady characterized 
by an inflammation of the ocular and palpe- 
bral conjunctivae. The aetiology is, of course, 
the implantation and growth in the conjunc- 
tival sac and conjunctiva of the gonococcu

similarly affected, or from urethral or vagin 
gonorrhoea occurring in the affected individ

Finally, it may be conveniently divided in 
ophthalmia neonatorum in the infant an 
ophthalmia gonorrhceica in the adult. 

It is the supervention of various compl 
cations that works so dire results and rende 
one anxious as to the final outcome of the 
case, and these are chiefly brought about by 
the extreme swelling cutting off corneal nu- 
trition, or infection of a corneal abrasion by 
the purulent discharge leading to a suppura- 
tive keratitis, perforation of cornea, pur 
iritis, and finally panophthalmitis and de- 
struction of the whole organ by purulent 
infiltration of all its delicate tissues. 

The prognosis is always good when the 
case is promptly seen and the patient placed 
under proper conditions of nursing, hygiene 
and treatment before complications have 
appeared; but after corneal infiltration has 
once taken place the prognosis must be very 
guarded. In any event, efforts to combat 
the disease should never at any time be re- 
laxed, since often astonishingly good repair

.will take place even under most unfavorable 
conditions. 

The symptoms of the malady are so well 
known that it would be a work of superero- 
gation to here enumerate them; the great 
swelling of the lids, the sudden onset and 
rapid progress, the thick purulent discharge, 
and the great chemosis, are unmistakable 
characteristics. 

The greatly increasing number of blind 
people from gonorrhceal infection has led 
ophthalmologists throughout all the United 
States to seek some means of checking its 
ravages; and among these may be mentioned 
Doctor Lucien Howe, of Buffalo, who in the 
New York State Legislature introduced a 
bill making it a misdemeanor punishable by 
imprisonment and a fine for any nurse or 
midwife to neglect to report to a medical 
man the appearance of a purulent discharge 
in the eyes of a new-born child. Many other 
States have similar laws in effective opera- 
Lion, and the time is not far distant when 
such legislation will be universal. 

What perhaps most concerns the practical 
physician is the management of the malady, 
and this may be divided into (a) prophylaxis 
and (b) treatment after the malady has be- 
some fairly established. As regards the 
former, it is the first duty of the physician to 
prevent the introduction of the germs into 
the conjunctival sac. In the case of a child 
still unborn it is well to give attention to the 
mother — to disinfect and keep disinfected 
the parturient canal; to exercise great care 
after. the infant is ushered into the world, 
avoiding in cleansing the eye and its environ- 
ments anything that can by any chance con- 
vey germs to the mucous membrane. Abso- 
lutely perfect cleanliness and asepsis is what 
should be aimed at and secured. Should the 
practitioner, however, be doubtful as to his 
abilities in this direction, there are two pro- 
cedures available: First, the method of 
Crede, viz., dropping into the conjunctival 
sac of the new-born a single drop of two- 
per-cent. silver-nitrate solution: Second, the 
Hegor-Kohn method, which consists of 
thorough disinfection of the eye and its sur- 
roundings by bichloride solution (i: iooo). — 
In case of an adult suffering from gonor- 
rhoea, it is usually enough to acquaint him 
with the severity of ocular infection and 



teach him the necessity of cleanliness and 
care. 

With these methods it is possible to very 
greatly reduce the number of cases of gonor- 
rhceal ophthalmia; but, pursued never so 
carefully, there would still remain cases of 
ophthalmia neonatorum, as well as gonor- 
rhceal ophthalmia in the adult. It is there- 
fore essential to know how to handle such. 

There is no place in the whole field of 
therapeutics where the old saying "Cleanli- 
ness is next to godliness" is so applicable as 
in the management of gonorrhceal ophthal- 
mia. Upon the thorough and systematic car- 
rying out of the physician's instructions as to 
the cleansing and disinfection of the conjunc- 
tival sac everything depends. But before 
entering upon the details of treatment I might 
say that the chief change which has taken 
place in the management of these cases of 
late years has been the employment of milder 
means; more dependence is now put upon 
thorough cleanliness and disinfection, and 
less upon strong astringents and surgical 
interference. Now a special nurse, or the 
equivalent of one, is detailed to take charge 
of the case. The eye is thoroughly cleansed 
every fifteen minutes, day and night, the lids 
being thoroughly everted and the mucous 
surface irrigated with boric acid and bor-ax 
solution; besides, three times daily, the lids, 
after eversion, are syringed with copious 
quantities of warm bichloride solution (i to 
10,000), half a pint to a pint being used each 
time. Once daily, also, a mild solution of 
nitrate of silver (five or ten grains to the 
ounce) is carefully applied. In the early 
stage, cold compresses are of value, but these 
should be discontinued as soon as the puru- 
lent discharge is well established or any anx- 
iety is felt about the integrity of the cornea. 
Should any corneal affection appear, atropine 
should be used. I would thoroughly con- 
demn any such procedure as conjunctival 
scarifications, because it is not good surgery 
to make a large number of raw and absorb- 
ing surfaces which are to be continually bathed 
in the conjunctival secretions. The galvano- 
cautery may be of value in controlling a 
sloughing corneal ulcer. 

In closing, allow me to refer to three in- 
teresting cases — one reported by Xeedham, 
and two of my own:

SPERMATO-CYSTITIS-A NEGLECTED 
COMPLICATION OF GONORRHOEA.* 

BY BURNSIDE FOSTER, M.D. 

My attention was first called to the seminal 
vesicles as the seat of trouble in certain 
genito-urinary disturbances by an article by 
Lloyd, of Birmingham, which appeared in 
The Lancet some time during the fall of 1891. 
Since then I have studied cases of a certain 
class from a very different point of view from 
any before entertained, and have acquired 
considerable information which was new, and 
which has enabled me to benefit my patients 
in a way which I had previously been unable 
to do. Recent articles by Fuller and Vaughan 
have also been of great interest and assist- 
ance, owing to new light on the subject and 
in corroborating my own observations.

the posterior surface of the bladder and the

Since I ha\ 1 

■':" to the routine examination of the 
seminal vesicles in all cases of posterior ure- 
thritis and epididymitis, I have become con-5 
vinced that the infection, to a greater or less 
degree, is much more frequent than I had 
previously had any idea of. Acute vesicu- 
litis undoubtedly does occur as a complica- 
tion of posterior urethritis independently of 
epididymitis or of prostatitis, but it is. I be- 
lieve, a rare affection. It is probably, how- 
ever, frequently overlooked, because the 
diagnosis can only be positively made by 
digital examination of the vesicles, a pro- 
ceeding which few physicians are accustomed 
to. When this condition exists the vesicles 
can be readily felt by the forefinger in the 
rectum, the patient standing with the body 
bent to nearly a right-angle, counter pressure 
being made with the other hand over the 
pubes. A sensitive oval fluctuating swelling 
on one side or the other, just beyond the 
posterior border of the prostate, will be felt. 
The size may be from two and a half to three 
inches in length and perhaps three-fourths 
of an inch in breadth. The feeling is very 
characteristic and cannot be mistaken, al- 
though a little difficult to describe. 

The more common disease of the vesicle 
is subacute or chronic inflammation, and 
this is seen long after the symptoms of 
the original trouble (gonorrhoea) have disap 
peared. I have never happened to see a case 
of this kind where there was not a previous 
history of gonorrhoea, but I can readily un- 
derstand how the condition might be caused 
by prolonged sexual excesses or masturba- 
tion, as has been the experience of other 
observers. 

The symptoms presented by individuals 
suffering from this affection are, as might be 
expected, various, and of course they depend 
somewhat upon the presence or absence of 
other conditions than the one I am now con- 
sidering. There will nearly always (always 
in my cases) be a history of posterior ure- 
thritis, and quite commonly of epididymitis;

! a slight but persistent urethral discharge, 
which has proved rebellious to all treatment, 
; is a constant symptom, and this is always ac- 
i companied by some form of sexual disturb- 
ance. The usual complaint is constant sexual 
&lt; desire, with diminished power. There may 
be frequent emissions unaccompanied by 
| pleasure or satisfaction, and often followed 
by a dull aching pain in the perineum. Af- 
:ter straining at stool the patient will occa- 
sionally notice that a little viscid yellowish 
i material escapes from the meatus. This 
[symptom is always the cause of much appre- 
hension, but is not necessarily of any import- 
jance, for it often occurs in perfectly healthy 
(individuals who indulge frequently in sexual 
^intercourse, and the exuded material may be 
ssimply prostatic secretion — in cases of vesic- 
ulitis, however, I have frequently found it to 
contain pus, a few blood-corpuscles, and 
Imore or less feeble or dead spermatozoa. 
[Frequent and painful erections, with involun- 
tary emissions, has been a prominent feature 
tin a few of my cases, and in one the seminal 
fluid was quite bloody. Unless there exists 
a posterior urethritis or cystitis, micturition 
may not be interfered with, although at times, 
[particularly after intercourse or ejaculation, 
iit is frequent and painful. A prominent fea- 
ture of the clinical picture of a typical case of 
'chronic vesiculitis is the severe disturbance 
of the nervous system. The patient is usually 
i worried, mentally depressed, and often pro- 
foundly melancholic. This is particularly 
the case when, as commonly happens, he re- 
llates that he has carried his woes from one 
doctor to another, has read everything he 
could find on the subject of sexual diseases, 
land has patronized all the secret remedies 
&gt;and quacks he could find the money to pay 
for. 

When a patient presents himself with the 
history and symptoms as above described, 
the first problem is of course the diagnosis. 
There are three essentials to a complete ex- 
amination of such a patient: Examination of 
the urine, examination of the urethra, and 
examination of the seminal vesicles by the 
rectum. Of the first two I shall not speak, 
as all are familiar therewith, but the last is 
usually neglected and without it an accu- 
rate diagnosis is impossible. It is usually 
possible after a little practice to demonstrate 



the normal seminal vesicles with the finger 
in the rectum, counter pressure being made 
with the other hand above the pubes. The 
diseased vesicle is always enlarged and can 
be readily palpated and some of its contents 
expressed, by gentle manipulation, into the 
urethra. The patient should present himself 
with several hours' accumulation of urine in 
the bladder, and the rectum empty. Before 
making the rectal examination a small amount 
of urine should be passed into a test glass, 
for the purpose of washing out the anterior 
urethra. The examination is best made with 
the body bent at a little more than a right- 
angle and supported by resting the palms of 
the hands in the seat of a chair. The right 
forefinger, if of ordinary length (the longer 
the better), inserted into the rectum, will 
reach well beyond the posterior edge of the 
prostate, and the vesicles will be felt, one on 
each side. The feeling of a distended vesicle 
has been well likened by Fuller — to whose 
article on this subject I desire to express my 
great indebtedness — to that of an engorged 
leech. The size may vary from but little 
larger than normal to that of a hen's egg. 
There is usually some tenderness, but unless 
the inflammation is quite acute there is not 
much pain complained of. By gently strok- 
ing or "milking" the distended vesicle, its 
contents may be forced out into the urethra, 
and at the conclusion of the examination the 
patient should again urinate into a glass, 
when this material can be obtained for ex- 
amination. 

The object of treatment in these cases is 
to restore the muscular tone to the vesicles; 
and to accomplish this they must be emptied 
at regular intervals, as, owing to their pro- 
longed distention, they have lost their normal 
tone and are unable to empty themselves. 
Various appliances have been devised to ex- 
ert pressure on the vesicles through the rec- 
tum, but none are as effectual as the forefinger 
of the surgeon properly applied. The patient 
should present himself at regular intervals, 
varying from five to eight days according to 
circumstances, and the vesicles manipulated 
by the surgeon after the manner above de- 
scribed. A little practice and the patient's 
sensations will determine the amount of force 
to be used. The relief which has followed 
the first two or three treatments has been

astonishing in nearly all i 
yet I have seen no bad results. All urethral 
D must be suspended, and if 
to wash out the bladder it 
ter not to use a catheter but to intro- 
duce a small tube into the opening of the 
urethra and allow the pressure of the fluid, 
evating the wash bottle, to overcome 
the sphir. This process of " milk- 

ing" or "stripping" the vesicle, as Fuller has 
termed it, should be continued as long 
as any distention of these sacs can tx 
— this time wiil vary from two to five or six 
months, — and in the vast majority of cases a 
:avorable result will be accomplished. 

I need not speak of the various indica- 
tions for tonic and hygienic therapeutics, 
which will of course be helpful as accessory 
to this method of treatment. But there is 
one caution which it is important to bear 
in mind: In a certain number of cases 
where the symptoms refer to the vesicles as 
the seat of trouble, it may be due to tubercu- 
and this must be carefully eliminated 
before attempting any local treatment. Digi- 
tal manipulation of a tubercular vesicle is 
sure to make the condition worse and to add 
greatly to the patient's danger and discom- 
fort. In addition to the other signs of genito- 
urinary, or perhaps general, tuberculosis, the 
vesicle has a characteristic feeling; instead 
of the smooth thin-walled sac, the wall is 
thicker and nodulated and may even have 
what might be described as a "snotty" feel- 
ing. Careful examination of the expressed 
material may show the presence of bacilli. 

I hope that those of my readers who have 
not been accustomed to use the method of 
examination and treatment described will be 
inspired to do so, for thus may be relieved 
a class of cases which have hitherto proved 
very obstinate and given the practitioner 
much trouble and anxiety.

PIONEER PRACTICE OF .MEDICINE IN THE 
NORTHWEST. 

BY P. A. WAI.I.i;. 

The subject I have selected is not new, but 
has about it this phase of origins 
each one's experience is unique, and if prop- 



ind inten 
ts that are like the old and oft-repeated 
story of the I 

-xian born, brought up, and 
educated in the city to undertake a task likef 

•vould be asdifru \ ill of im 

bilities as for a countryman to describe a soci-! 
cial gathering or the management of a 
great hospital in the city; and while, there-i 
fore. I should feel unquah: the latter] 

task. I may unostentatious 

qualified for this burden, havm. 
seen the light in a cow mtie," and all 

my days, except the few years of profe- 
al study, having been passed amid country! 
scenes. 

I came to the place where I am noirl 
located within two years of its first - 
ment by white people. We were then fifty 
miles from a railroad, and practically, though 
not nominally, fifteen miles from a postoffic 
from which our mail was brought by volun 
teer service once each week. The country 
was sparsely settled, but improvement was 
rapid, and though it was nine years before^ 
we had a railroad it was not nearly so long 
before we had efficient daily mail service and 
many other advantages of a civilized com- 
munity. — I perhaps need not say that poverty 
compelled a continuation of experiences like 
these, for had it been otherwise my stay in 
such a place would have been too short for 
narration. 

I considered myself well enough provided 
with education to serve as a backing against 
opposition, and with a determined will and 
the highest hopes I went to work to build 
for myself a practice and for my family a 
home. Instruments were scarce, and of effi- 
cient counsel there was none. What was 
done had to be done alone, and more often 
than I could wish results had to be left with 
a higher power. 

The territory over which my rides extend- 
ed covered an area of about ten 6y fifty 
miles. The roads are good at nearly all 
seasons; but the winter temperature is ex- 
tremely low and that of the summer very 
high, so that between 55" below zero and 
100" above the work of my life has been ac- 
complished. 

On the coldest night I ever saw, when the 
thermometer registered 55 ° below zero, I

rode fourteen miles and attended a miscar- 
riage. At 9 p.m. my work was done and I 
was ready to return home, but, the night 
being so cold, I thought best to stay until 
morning. The only bed in the house was 
occupied by the patient, and the nature of 
the case and the presence of the husband 
effectually precluded retirement, so I sat by 
the stove, which I all night plied with dry 
wood, and though clothed with heavy gar- 
ments, including a new buffalo overcoat, I 
secured so heavy a cold as to be prostrated 
for days. For this attendance I received the 
munificent sum of eight dollars, after waiting 
about a year and threatening forcible col- 
lection. 

I have often been called out of a warm 
room and bed at 3 a.m. when the thermometer 
registered 40 below zero, and, after hitch- 
ing up my own horse, have ridden eight or a 
dozen miles in the face of a fierce blast, and 
without freezing any portion of my person. 

I have run after patients until nearly worn 
out, only to be told I was welcome to my 
pay if I could get it. I have been cursed for 
diagnosing and reporting contagious dis- 
eases; have been discharged for being honest 
and truthful in my statements, and refused 
paying employment because I would not 
stoop to acts which the law holds to be 
criminal. In the face of all this I have not 
lost faith in humanity, for on the other hand 
there are always true men who honor an 
honest physician, and I often think of old 
Elijah — who, when he thought everything 
had gone against him, found seven thousand 
who had never bowed the knee to Baal, — 
and take new courage. 

There is a great tendency among fron- 
tiersmen toward perfection — in their own 
minds — in almost all lines of business. The 
uncouth rowdy generally knows all about 
the law, and exactly how a good sermon 
should be prepared and delivered; how the 
best actors equip for the stage; and how easy 
a matter it is to run a bank. As to medicine, 
they are "out of sight," and on the slightest 
provocation the most ignorant will set up as 
practitioners with no preparation whatever. 
While this is to an educated man wonderful, 
it is not half so strange as the fact that these 
impostors (and the greater the imposition the 
more following it secures) will so easily gain 



access to the confidence of men who hold 
themselves to be well informed. 

I am acquainted with a self-styled " Doc- 
tor " who bases his right to practice altogether 
on the fact that he "practiced" in the State 
prior to 1887, who cannot write his own name, 
and whose materia medica consists of golden 
seal, sweet-flag, liquorice, aicohol, and water; 
he is in continuous practice in our own and 
adjoining counties. This man puts up in a 
large bottle medicine that costs about twenty 
cents, fills the bottle with water, and furnishes 
it to parties at $2.00 — parties who refuse to 
go to an honest physician and pay fifty cents 
for a diagnosis and prescription. Another of 
the ilk is possessor of a glass lens, or some- 
thing similar, which he professes was made 
by a prisoner in some far-off country, who 
made only three and then died. This glass 
he places over a part and claims by its aid to 
"see right through a man" and actually 
view the morbid processes of the internal 
economy. I suppose he would read the in- 
most thoughts if he could read at all — which 
he cannot do, having never mastered the 
alphabet. To one of his patients he declared, 
as he held the "instrument" over the chest 
of the latter, that he could see clear to the 
essential procreative organs at will — though 
his statement was scarcely clothed in so ele- 
gant terms. This man came to our town 
during the "hard times" and took out there- 
from $118 in one day — this at a time when 
regular physicians were averaging about fifty 
cents a week cash business. Happily such 
creatures are "only remembered for what they 
have done," and, though for a time they run 
high and cause a great commotion, they very 
often have to move around and always to a 
lower sphere. 

Dishonest practitioners are the bane of the 
profession anywhere, but it seems much more 
so in a new country; but this is perhaps 
owing to the fact that country doctors are 
almost invariably at war with each other. 
City practitioners who go into dens and low 
places probably see more of squalor and 
filth than it is possible to find in country 
practice; but, on the other hand, it is possible 
to do a large business in the city and not 
reach a place where aseptic surgery could 
not be practiced successfully. In pioneer 
practice this is not so; in fact, aseptic habits

which is very often both suggestive and bi-

with such surroundings on the aseptic plan is 
simply out of the question; and a free use of 

ttion of bichloride and a firm reliance 
on a Divine Providence is about all there is 
left to do. 

There are some things about pioneer work 
which, while they might not seem pleasant at 
first, are really safety-valves in country prac- 
tice. In pioneer work a man is not expected 
at first to have an office. One room of the 
house serves the double purpose of sitting- 
room and place of business. His books, for 
want of a case, are packed on the floor or on 
a dry-goods box; and his instruments he can 
carry in his pocket and they are always with 
him. Those used for amputations can be 
made to serve the additional purpose of saw- 
ing the wood and cutting the bacon for 
breakfast. His horse he can use to draw his 
wood and plow his garden. The time be- 
tween cases can be occupied in cutting the 
wood, hoeing corn, cultivating pumpkins and 
potatoes, making fence, improving the lawn, 
and repairing his buildings; always, however, 
being careful to say to an unexpected patient 
that he is doing this for exercise and to re- 
lieve the monotony of his extensive practice. 

A country physician is expected to, and 
really should, know nearly everything in 
medicine — much more than is expected of 
city physicians who have so much better 
opportunities for special lines. He must 
practice midwifery; be able to diagnose and 
treat alone all the complications of labor — 
anaesthetize, use the forceps, turn, perforate; 
perhaps at a moment's warning, without 
counsel, and mayhap without proper instru- 
ments, open the abdomen or lose his patient. 
He must diagnose and treat at least all gynae- 
cological diseases, from pediculus pubis to 
ovarian tumor. He must extract teeth, pre- 
scribe for bald heads, barber's itch, and all 



skin i H&lt; must 

i tion, trephine 
ikull, reduce or o; .:; inguinal 

or femoral hernia. In short, he mus 
ready t&lt;&gt; meet at ,t moment's wan 
thing from a slight "cold imputation 

of the hip-joint; and woe be to him if his 
education or courage should fail, for country 
critics are sharper than a surgeo;. 
and no talk will be spared to make th( 
patent that he failed in such or such a 
while if he succeeds it is only a mat: 
cour-r. 

When he is through, and his horse properly 
stabled and fed, when he has cut the wood 
for the night and fixed other things in proper 
shape, he puts the whole day's work on the 
books, calls at the store, buys a little coffee 
and codfish to enable his wife to make a 
breakfast, has it charged (for money he 
rarely has, except at long intervals), and goes 
home to retire, only, perhaps, to commence 
the next day's work by turn of midnight. 

Books, journals and medical societies are 
few and far between, for expenses must be 
met, mouths must be filled, and clothing, in 
this rigorous climate, is not to be ignored. 
When all necessities are provided for, too 
often other things are out of the question. 

When collection time comes, what a fine 
variety he has at his command ! Oats, hay, 
flour, potatoes, meat, wood, straw, work, and 
in fact anything that can possibly be used or 
disposed of in any manner, is taken and 
credited on account. Did I mention money? 
No ? Well, he does now and then get money. 
Silver dollars without holes punched in them 
are sometimes paid to a country doctor: but 
this is a rare occurrence and is not ex- 
pected to be the rule. A short time since a 
man came to me and wanted to know if I 
could take railroad ties for a small bill. I 
told him I would do so, but he has so far 
failed to bring them. 

Now I have a word to say in behalf of the 
practitioner who does not follow strictly in 
what he knows to be the best course. Is it 
wonderful, after all the foregoing varied ex- 
perience, that a country doctor sometimes 
takes to drink— that he sometimes tries to 
drown his sorrows and perplexities in the 
flowing bowl, or stifle his feelings with the

too well known narcotic? Ought not sym- 
pathy and love to go out and environ the one 
who is thus degrading himself; and rather 
than condemn too soon, would it not be bet- 
ter to hold him with an encouraging notice 
or a favorable recognition and thereby lead 
him to take a more hopeful view of life and 
its advantages, and to see that with true per- 
severance he may at some future day be able 
to hire his wood cut, pay cash for his grocer- 
ies, and take a medical journal even though 
it cost no more than one dollar per annum? 

I would not have you conclude by this pa- 
per that I am discouraged or disheartened. 
On the other hand, I am full of hope for a 
brilliant future. Pioneer life in our part of 
the country is a thing of the past. The tele- 
graph and railroad bring us into close commu- 
nion with the world, and by their use any of 
the physicians of the city are within about 
fifteen hours of our village, two hundred 
miles away. 

An abundance of instruments, good libra- 
ries, and a reasonably appreciative commu- 
nity make the practice of medicine less and 
still less onerous; and I yet hope the future 
will bring that millennium when country doc- 
tors may counsel together without enmity 
and be so far reconciled as to bury the hatchet 
and not remember where it lies concealed.

A NOVEL METHOD OF ASSISTING UTER= 
INE INERTIA. 

BY FRANCIS PERCIVAL COWAX, M.D., CM. 

I wish to place before the profession a sin- 
gular and unlooked-for circumstance. It is 
sometimes strange how one discovers the 
different uses (not otherwise mentioned) of 
medicinal preparations, if only possessed of 
observant faculties; but when one unexpect- 
edly stumbles upon something useful and 
practical, he is apt to become reticent and 
await with pleasure, patience and expectancy 
the further outcome of investigation. Such 
were my feelings when I found by repeated 
experiments that Glycerin Suppositories are 
of more value than merely as agents for the 
cleansing of the rectum; in fact, I may say 
they are of greater value to the obstetrician 
in assisting prolonged cases of labor, due 



either to inertia or to the nervous tempera- 
ment of the mother whereby she becomes 
unable to assist herself. Having reached 
such a conclusion, I will now relate the pecu- 
liar incident that led to it. 

Possessed of a somewhat extensive mid- 
wifery practice, and having by repeated ex- 
periences learned the advisability of having 
the bowels thoroughly well cleansed, for the 
comfort of both patient and accoucheur, it 
has been my custom to carry a large bottle of 
Parke, Davis &amp; Company's glycerin supposi- 
tories. One day I was called in a hurry to 
attend a young woman with her first-born. 
Not having been previously engaged for the 
case, I found upon my arrival that the 
necessary preparations had been overlooked. 
After the usual cautions I proceeded to ex- 
amine, and found the os uteri well dilated, 
membranes unruptured, parts small, and 
pains of a very weak nature with long inter- 
vals between. Upon inquiry I elicited the 
fact that she had then been in labor about 
twelve hours, but it had not been considered 
necessary to send for a physician, the pains 
being so very weak. Thinking I had a long 
and tedious case before me, I adopted my 
usual routine practice of placing a glycerin 
suppository in the rectum. It had not been 
long in situ when my patient implored me to 
remove the " horrid thing," as it caused very 
severe pain. I assured her, however, that the 
suffering thus induced would cease as soon as 
the bowels moved. Presently, and much to 
my surprise, I discovered the pains were those 
of labor, the intervals being quickly short- 
ened. 

After eight or ten strong pains I again ex- 
amined and found little or no progress of 
the head; and at the persistent and repeated 
requests of my patient I removed the sup- 
pository — that is, what remained of it. Im- 
mediately the pains ceased and the intervals 
again became lengthened. After waiting for 
an hour or more, it suddenly occurred to me 
the glycerin suppository previously placed 
must have acted otherwise than expected — 
that in fact it might have stimulated the uterus 
to activity. Anxious to determine if such were 
the fact, I reintroduced a suppository in the 
rectum, assuring the woman that this time it 
must remain. As a result, I was soon re- 
warded by increased uterine contractions

MANKIND AND BACTERIA— A HISTORICAL 
LEGEND. 

BY E. B. WARD, M.D. 

Twas a million years, we may safely say — 

3, a hundred million years ago — 
That a cell dropped out of the Milky Way 

And fell to the earth, which was hot, you know- 
Just right for incubation. 
And the cell increased and it multiplied 

Like Hakes in a howling winter's storm. 
Till at last they were by some means allied. 
And took on action and shape and form 
As a certain kind of creation. 

And so the proliferation went on 

From lower to higher grade upon grade, 
And millions and cycles of years had gone 

While Xature worked at creation's trade — 
For she is no fool or a flunkey — 
Till at last, as she graded up the cell, 

She reached, as she fancied, the highest point, 
When from her fair lingers a creature fell, 

Supple and active in every joint, 

Hut it proved to be a monkey.

MISTAKEN NOTIONS ABOUT GLASSES.* 

BY F. C. HEATH, A.M., M.D. 

The mistaken notions of the laity on med- 
ical matters are proverbial, and some of these 
relative to the eye seem to be shared by a 
portion of the profession. I wish briefly to 
point out some common errors in regard to 
glasses. 

The general idea as to the object of glasses 
is not altogether correct. Most people would 
say they were for the improvement of vision, 
but the relief of eye-strain is a more import- 
ant indication in many cases. Not infre- 
quently the glass a person sees through best 
(especially on the first examination) is not 
the best for the eye; for example, a weak 
concave lens may give a hypermetrope sharp 
vision by exciting the ciliary muscle to over- 
action, or in case of spasm of that muscle, yet 



*Read at Mitchell and Delavan District Medical 
Societies. 



by adding to the work of the muscle it will 
increase the eye-strain. 

People are often in error as to the effects of 
glasses: they imagine that from an oculist 
or optician they can secure lenses that will 
give perfect, immediate and permanent relief, 
no matter how much they may have abused 
their eyes or how long the trouble may have 
continued; furthermore, they expect to con- 
tinue to abuse and overwork their eyes as 
before. But overworked eyes need rest as 
much as an overworked or strained arm or 
leg, and relief of the strain usually comes 
gradually; moreover, it generally takes time 
to become used to glasses, as the eye muscles 
do not immediately relax. 

Some object to wearing glasses from fear 
of becoming slaves thereto; they imagine 
they may always have to wear them and that 
after a time they can never see as well with- 
out them as before. This, however, is true 
of a portion of the cases only, more particu- 
larly those having high degrees of error, and 
in such, instead of an objection, it should be 
regarded as quite the opposite on account of 
the greater enjoyment of life and increased 
usefulness through relief of eye-strain and 
improvement of vision. The reason why the 
eye in some cases sees less without the glass 
than before, is because it becomes accustomed 
to allowing the glass to do for it some of the 
work it had formerly done for itself. In 
many cases, however, the vision improves 
either with the glass or without it if the glass 
has been worn for some time. Quite fre- 
quently it is discovered the eye needs the 
help of glasses for a short period only, and 
then, the work having lessened, the system 
improved, or the eye-strain being relieved, 
they may be dispensed with. — This is most 
likely to prove true in low degrees of error. 
With regard to near-sightedness, which pro- 
gresses in so many cases, the opinion of the 
best authorities is that it remains stationary 
where a full correction is worn from child- 
hood. 

Those who refuse to wear glasses on ac- 
count of the annoyance are guilty of exagger- 
ation, if they are not entirely mistaken. The 
annoyance is usually temporary and should 
have no weight in comparison with the advan- 
tages to be gained; in fact, it is no uncommon 
occurrence for a person to hunt for his glasses

d«&gt;ne in all cases of deft jht, whet; 

due • in the media, disease of the 

fundus, astigmatism, myopia, or high degrees 
I or far-sight — the reason in the 
named condition is, because the image 
formed on the retina from the object at the 
proper focal distance (so far away) is very 
small, and the patient prefers a large image 
to one more sharply defined, especially as his 
contracted pupil cuts off many of the circles 
of diffusion which would otherwise be con- 
fusing. There is also an apparent near- 
sightedness in cases of spasm of the muscle 
of accommodation, where the patient may be 
actually far-sighted when the muscle is re- 
laxed or in its proper condition. 

The question, " How is it that a child sees 
well with his grandfather's spectacles?" sug- 
gests another mistaken notion — that glasses 
go by age. Of course, old sight usually 
comes on at about the age of forty-five and 
increases as one grows older, near-sight is 
sometimes progressive, and some latent far- 
sightedness may become manifest as the lens 
loses its elasticity with advancing years; but 
aside from such considerations as these, 
glasses do not go by age, and the child sees 
with his grandfather's glasses only because 
both need convex glasses, one to bring back 
the near-point in old sight, the other to bring 
rays to a focus properly on his retina in far- 
sightedness. 

The frequency with which glasses are seen 
upon school children is so much an object of 
remark as to imply that they are often worn 
when not needed. This may be true in some 
cases, for with many rest and attention to the 
general health would so improve the eyes as 
to render spectacles unnecessary; but it is 
far more probable that more go without lenses 
who would be helped by their use, and re- 
lieved from headaches and nervousness, and 
enabled to see so much better as to enable 
them more successfully to compete with their 
companions. A large proportion of the pupils 
called dull are misjudged— they may either 
appear dull from defects of sight or hearing, 



or be actually rendered I . such 

handicaps 
The preferei 

ither than s; • often le; 

serious mistakes. Relief of eye-strain and 

ervation of sight are far more imp 
than any notions i ishion or 

appearance. It is important in n. st 
that patients look through the centre of the 
lenses, and that the axis of cylinders anil 
angles of prisms be maintained exactly 
dered. Hardly any eye-glass will answer this 
requirement, though the bar-spring comes 
nearest to doing so. 

In the use of protective glasses, mistakes 
are likely to occur. Colored glasses are ob- 
jectionable, allowing heat rays and irritating 
color-rays to pass through. Blue, which ex- 
cludes heat rays, is the least objectionable, 
and is frequently worn with comfort. Smoked 
glasses are to be preferred generally, as af- 
fording greater comfort. Too dark a glass 
may do harm, causing eye-strain from efforts 
to secure vision through it, and as a general 
rule it may be said no dark glasses should be 
used unnecessarily, lest they render the eye 
more sensitive to light than before. They 
serve a very useful purpose, however, in case 
of eyes actually diseased or those extremely 
sensitive to light. 

Perhaps the most mistaken idea about 
glasses is that anybody can fit them. Con- 
sidering the difficulty of accurate fitting, the 
harm from unsuitable glasses, the danger of 
having spectacles applied to diseased eyes 
needing other special treatment, and in short 
the fact that he who fits glasses should 
thoroughly understand the condition and 
needs of each eye and prescribe only after 
careful consideration of all the attainable 
facts in connection with the case, including 
search for concealed defects as well as mani- 
fest errors, every one should decline to rele- 
gate such work to druggists, jewelers, op- 
ticians, and pretenders of any stripe or kind. 
Accurate fitting requires the highest skill of 
the oculist, and "the best is none too good." 
He should have sufficient knowledge of medi- 
cine and diseases also to judge whether the 
symptoms complained of are primarily due 
to eye trouble, and how they can probably 
be best relieved. The most skillful man will 
find perplexing cases enough— what then is

to be expected of the incompetent and unre- 
liable? Gould is right when he says: "The 
optician should stand in the same relation to 
the ophthalmic physician as the druggist to 
the general physician. The one should be 
as much forbidden by law to prescribe spec- 
tacles as the other medicine."

TYPHOID FEVER. 

BY W. H. A. YOUNG, M.D. 

I desire to briefly state some of my experi- 
ences in this disease. It is not my purpose 
to give special symptoms or an elaborate 
history of typhoid fever, nor to determine 
whether or not it results from a bacillus in 
drinking-water, from adulterated milk, from 
cans rinsed with contaminated water, from 
microbes in the atmosphere, from oysters 
fatted at the mouth of a sewer, or from 
micrococci generated from the morbid con- 
ditions within the victim of its attack. 

I do not consider typhoid fever a conta- 
gious disease; neither is it transmitted from 
one person to another by simple exposure. 
As a rule, the patient will have been more or 
less indisposed for some days. When the 
physician is first called to prescribe for him, 
he complains of a tired, worn-out feeling, 
pain in the head and body generally, some- 
times chills, constipation, and insomnia. I 
have never been able to avert the disease, 
and not always able to recognize it positively 
until in its second week. When called to 
typhoid, if possible I place the patient in a 
sizable room, well ventilated, and remove 
the bed from the wall in order to allow easy 
access to all sides of it — I never submit to a 
feather bed. I commence treatment by re- 
lieving the bowels with a mild laxative and 
enema if required, and give the following: 
Tinctures of aconite and veratrum viridi, 
each five to ten minims, in four ounces of 
water, a teaspoonful every two hours, alter- 
nating with Euthymol, four drachms in four 
ounces of water, same dose. After the 
bowels are evacuated I give five grains of 
quinine, three minims of tincture gelsemium, 
and one minim of tincture nux vomica, in a 
solution of tartaric acid (five grains to ounce) ; 
order a sponge bath every morning; and rub 



the body over every night with a dry towel. 
If there is a tendency to diarrhoea, I use the 
following: Powdered rhubarb one and a half 
ounces, bicarbonate of soda one drachm, 
boiling water half-pint, sugar, a little brandy 
and essence of peppermint; a teaspoonful 
once every four hours. If more than two 
evacuations occur in the twenty-four hours, 
I add to each dose a powder of leptandrin, 
opium, and chalk or charcoal; if the stools 
are foetid, two drops saturated solution of 
carbolic acid to the Euthymol mixture previ- 
ously mentioned. If cough is troublesome, 
take two drachms fluid extract liquorice, 
fifteen minims fluid extract lettuce, ten 
minims fluid extract squill, one drachm es- 
sence of wintergreen, and simple syrup to 
make a four-ounce mixture, with which the 
throat may be moistened when there is an 
inclination to cough. Ten drops of tincture 
drosera may be added to the sedative mix- 
ture (aconite and veratrum) if desired. If 
the patient takes kindly to milk, I care for 
no other nourishment. I allow him water, 
crust-coffee and camphric tea for drink. I 
seldom give any stimulant until about the 
seventeenth day, or on approaching crisis, 
and even then cautiously. 

Following this course, I have never had 
haemorrhage or troublesome tympanites. It 
is essential that the physician place his hand 
on the abdomen and over the bladder every 
day, looking for soreness and a distended 
bladder — retention of urine will cause trouble 
and increase delirium. Following this course 
of treatment in a severe case of typhoid, the 
temperature will run from ioi° in the morn- 
ing to 104 in the evening. Everything else 
being even, ninety-seven out of every hun- 
dred should recover, convalescing in about 
four weeks.

DERMATITIS HERPETIFORHIS. 

BY J. J. MOONEY, L.S.A. (LOND.). 

Last summer a married woman, thirty years 
of age, while away at the seaside began to 
be troubled by a rash which made its appear- 
ance chiefly on the lower limbs. As she was 
only to be away ten days, she did not consult 
any one until she came back. 






THE MEDICAL AGE. 



On examination I found a 
scattered along the course of the external, 
middle and internal cutaneous nerve* 
legs, the largest being over the internal cu- 
taneous. Bach one was seated on a small 
red base, and all exactly resembled the ordi- 
I es of herpes. The eruption 
i burning pain, in addition to itching. 

In spite of treatment the vesicles dried up 
and scabbed off very slowly, taking nearly 
three months in the process; and they left 
patches of brownish discoloration on the skin 
i hat still persist. Patient was not pregnant, 
had no menstrual trouble, and seemed to be 
otherwise in good health, hence the onset of 
the eruption appeared to be connected chiefly 
with the change of air due to going to the 
seaside. 

This spring a younger sister of the patient, 
aged nineteen years, and also married, came 
over to America with her husband. On the 
voyage and after arrival she was a good deal 
troubled with facial neuralgia. Within a few 
days after landing, an erythematous rash 
made its appearance in patches along the 
course of the musculo-cutaneous and internal 
saphenous nerves of the leg, and a day or two 
later manifested itself on the arms, where it 
chiefly followed the course of the musculo- 
spiral and internal cutaneous nerves. There 
were no vesicles unless the patient yielded to 
the temptation to rub it on account of the 
itching. It persisted for several months, but 
has now almost disappeared without leaving 
any marks behind. This patient was two 
months pregnant at the time of coming over 
to America, and, though a little pale, was 
otherwise apparently in good health. 

These two cases are interesting as showing 
the family tendency, the liability to onset in a 
predisposed person on change of climate, and 
the general intractability, of the complaint. 
In both I adopted a general tonic treat- 
ment, iron and quinine, and iron and arsenic, 
with soothing local applications, but it seemed 
to run its own course in spite of all treatment.

MALARIA AND SO.1i: Ol \\\\\ MA ROSES. 

I wish to give you two formula? exceed- 
ingly useful in my hands, and th . 
prove of benefit to others, in case you con- 
r them worthy of pla 
■:n a pharmaceutical standpoint it is 
possible one might not consider the first very 
eligible, yet it has been most satisfactory in 
my hands, which is, of course, its chief rec- 
ommendation. 

I have frequently encountered cases of 
chronic malarial toxaemia in which quinine 
sulphate appeared to be of little benefit. The 
trial of Peruvian bark secured fairly good re- 
sults, but I found considerable difficulty in 
administering it. Finally I resorted to the 
best powdered yellow calisaya bark, and ex- 
tracted from it all that water and dilute phos- 
phoric acid would dissolve; the finished prod- 
uct represents ten grains of calisaya bark and 
fifteen drops of dilute acid (to which I add 
sufficient aromatics, sugar, etc., to make it 
palatable) to the fluidrachm. The result is a 
beautiful syrup, not at all disagreeable. 

As for the advantages of the foregoing, 
phosphoric acid can be taken internally for 
almost an indefinite period of time, and has 
not the objections of sulphuric acid, the usual 
solvent used for cinchona alkaloids. The 
preparation is a general tonic of value; it 
holds in solution the calcium found in cali- 
saya bark; and it possesses the advantage 
of offering the total active principles of the 
drug, which in my experience are more effi- 
cient than merely one of its alkaloids. I do 
not find the mixture in any way depressing, 
and it is most beneficial in certain forms of 
nervous disease and in low fever, as well as 
in malaria.* 

The successful ''special treatment" of 
nervous diseases consists chiefly in intelli- 
gently removing the pathological conditions 
from' the affected viscera. I have used 
large quantities of the following mixture in 
nervous trouble due to gastric derangement. 
Its therapeutic range is quite apparent. It 
has been three generations in my family, but 
I know nothing of its original source. Its 
composition is: Coarse ground rhubarb, 
coarse ground golden seal, coarse ground 
cinnamon, dried peppermint leaves, of each

one-half pound; alcohol (98-percent.), seven 
pints. Mix, let stand for five or six days, 
then pour off tincture; next percolate through 
the drug residue ten gallons of hot water. 
To the first-made tincture add one-half 
pound carbonate of potash and two ounces 
of gum camphor dissolved in one pint 98-per- 
cent, alcohol. Shake well together, add to 
the water filtrate from the dregs, and finally 
add twenty-two pounds of sugar, and again 
filter. 

This I find particularly valuable in the 
summer complaints of children. It is a sort 
of expansion of so-called "Neutralizing Cor- 
dial," formerly so much used, but to my mind 
a decided improvement over the latter.

A SEill-MONTHLY REVIEW OF HEDICINE. 



-ITBUSHED HY- 



ANTISEPSIS AND ANTNOPIUM. 

Editor Medical Age: 

The remarkable triumphs of the Wood- 
bridge treatment of aborting typhoid fever 
furnish an abundance of food for thought, 
particularly as it is an achievement hitherto 
deemed impossible. Twenty years since, 
every practitioner believed this malady must 
run its tedious course — a course that too 
often ended fatally; but Doctor Woodbridge 
loses no patients and aborts the course of 
the disease, all by means of a strictly rational 
and radical method of treatment. There are 
no palliatives, no anodynes, no opiates; all is 
consistent, antiseptic, and scientific. This 
to me appears the most glorious and un- 
equivocal stroke of Galenic genius which 
modern medicine has ever offered — that is, 
if we accept Doctor Woodbridge's report as 
it stands. Says Sir James Watson: 

There is one point in the treatment of fever of 
exceeding importance, and of much nicety: I mean 
the use of opiates. If they are given inopportunely, 
they are apt to puzzle and perplex the case. You 
do not know how much of the disposition to coma 
is owing to the disease, and how much is the con- 
sequence of the remedy. Again, you may usually 
augment the natural tendency to coma, and lull 
your patient into a fatal stupor. But when judi- 
ciously administered, opium will often save a pa- 
tient who would inevitably sink without it. 

If we intelligently seek intestinal antisepsis 
we may then bid good-bye to opium. The 
new method of treatment, moreover, suggests 
that galenicals may be more successfully re- 
lied on for the relief of appendicitis than the 
modern surgeon is at present willing to ad- 
mit.

THE INDEX MEDICUS. 

In the last issue of The Medical Age 
(page 436) mention was made of a desire 
expressed in various quarters for reestablish- 
ment of the Index Medicus. It will be remem- 
bered that a proposition was made, through 
the columns of the New York Medical Jour- 
nal, by Doctor Charles E. Sajous, that those 
interested in this valuable periodical should 
each subscribe twenty-five dollars annually 
towards its perpetuation. The remarks of 
our New York contemporary, coupled with 
our own on the occasion mentioned, seem to 
have borne good fruit, as we have just been 
informed by Mr. Geo. S. Davis that he has 
received checks for twenty-five dollars each, 
aside from that of Doctor Charles E. Sajous, 
from eight gentlemen. 

There is no doubt that there are a large 
number who are anxious to further this en- 
terprise financially, and who are only waiting 
for the initiative to be taken by others, and 
it is for this reason that we publish the fore- 
going list. The publisher, moreover, desires 
us to say that this money will be applied to 
nothing not the absolute expense of publica- 
tion, and that such portion thereof as may 
remain unexpended at the end of the year 
will be returned pro rata to these special sub- 
scribers. 

We shall publish the additions to this list 
as often as such occur, and respectfully re-

CONSTIPATION. 

This complaint, which, after all is said, is a 
symptom rather than a malady, is of almost 
universal prevalence in the United States, 
where so little attention is paid to the more 
healthful forms of exercise or those athletics 
which tend to the perfection of the economy 
as a whole. 

Sedentary life, more than any other one 
cause, is responsible for this condition. It is 
notorious that our people do not use their 
legs judiciously. The bicycle, the horse, the 
tram car, the railway — all the different modes 
of propulsion on land or water — are, from 
the standpoint of the hygienist, patronized to 
an inordinate degree, and tend to both favor 
and perpetuate this condition. As a result, 
Americans as a class are devoted to purga- 
tives. In proportion to population, in no 
country is there such an universal sale of 
laxatives — mineral waters, aperient pills, anti- 
constipation granules, cathartic wafers, anti- 
bilious pastilles, purgative pellets, etc., etc., 
ad nauseam. 

The table habits of the people likewise 
have much to do with constipation. First, 
those who indulge in malt and alcoholic 
liquors rarely do so upon a full stomach and 
at the termination of a meal, but employ 
these fluids as " teasers" and "whets" to the 



tken at any period fron 
tes before eating. — With 
that spirituous abomination "the i 
tail" is deemed a necessity; it has been in- 
ie forerunner of every banquet, 
having been brought from Scandinavia and 
ess of food is 
iseatial to the providing of fuel for the 
evolution of animal heat. Second, the food is, 
rule, badly cooked, imperfectly chewed, 
bolted, and rarely more than half-dig- 

result, the prim &gt;ecomes over- 

loaded—is clogged with a mass of material 
to no good end, and that continues to 
no purpose save decreasing the tonicity of 
the digestive tract. 

More cases of constipation are traceable 
directly to such improper digestion, with the 
resultant concomitant of imperfect peristal- 
sis, than to any other cause; and physicians, 
in treating these cases, too frequently com- 
mit the great error of prescribing cathartics, 
thereby securing to the patient temporary 
relief without in the least modifying the pri- 
mary cause. Those familiar with the char- 
acteristics of Abernethy will recall his remark 
to a well known gourmand who w,as a con- 
stant patient: "You d — d fool, you fill your 
guts to repletion and then come to me to 
empty them." To be sure, by means of a 
cathartic the effete mass is swept out of the 
intestine, but this very effort tends to still 
further weaken an already impaired function. 

Cascara Sagrada, which is perhaps one of 
the very best alteratives known to the mate- 
ria medica, owes its reputation not to its 
alterative action, but to its auxiliary prop- 
erties whereby it acts as an intestinal tonic — 
it strengthens muscular activity, stimulates 
secretion, and provokes peristalsis; yet this 
very drug has in many instances fallen into 
desuetude because it cannot create anew a 
function that has become practically obso- 
lete; its patrons continue their pernicious 
habits and then wonder why the remedy upon 
which they have so long depended loses its 
activity except as its doses are increased or 
it is fortified by some agent more drastic. 

What the average nineteenth-century Amer- 
ican appears to need is a food that requires 
neither trituration nor digestion— that will 
be assimilated without even a shadow of 
physiological effort; nothing else will meet

the demand of a class possessed of vicious 
habits which they will not endeavor to rem- 
edy. The majority of individuals learn no 
lessons by experience, but treat their stomachs 
and digestive apparatus as if made of steel 
.and practically unlimited in wear and tear 
'and power of recovery from abuse; yet the 
most perfect steam-engine could not undergo 
a tithe of the ill treatment that these unfor- 
tunates accord to their digestive apparatus 
■'without it speedily being relegated to the 
jscrap-pile. Dyspepsia, which has already be- 
icome known as the " national disease," covers 
ija multitude of sins, and has for its first evi- 
dence imperfect digestion and assimilation. 

The new remedy, Taka-Diastase, which 
Ihas been heralded as of especial value in 
[those forms of indigestion resultant from 
labuse of amylotic foods, has unexpectedly 
jdeveloped a newer and more valuable power, 
viz., of correcting impaired functional activ- 
ity arising from indiscretions of the table. 
Its use, within limits, insures within the in- 
Itestinal canal that digestion which should be 
the concomitant of perfect health and habits. 
Thus it promises to be one of the most active 
•remedies for those forms of constipation that 
(result from vicious table habits. 

It is an error to suppose that the greater 
jpart of digestion goes on within the stomach; 
the province of this organ is chiefly prepara- 
tory. Preparation having been • made for 
action by the juices of the duodenum, the 
[food passes the pyloric orifice, perhaps only 
ito be disappointed with the results that ac- 
crue. An imperfectly digested, fermenting 
imass next obtains, that may remain station- 
ary or latent, or be crowded on into the lesser 
iintestine, there to be relieved of the greater 
portion of its fluids, and then become a focus 
of disturbance as an impacted, semi-dry, fer- 
menting mass, with all the unfortunate sequelae 
of absorption into the circulation of poisonous 
gases and ptomaine toxicity that are thus 
developed. In such instances Taka-Diastase 
takes up the work which has been accom- 
plished but imperfectly in the duodenum, and 
by stimulating secretion and supplying its 
own fermentative energy accomplishes an act 
[of superdigestion — it completes that which 
should have taken place elsewhere. This 
superdigestion reduces the nourishment to 
proper consistency without external aid, as- 



sures assimilation, and finally provokes peri 
stalsis whereby the now faecal mass is forced 
onward to an extra-intestinal existence; thus 
the condition of constipation that would 
otherwise have accrued is overcome, and the 
result attained is physiological rather than 
artificial. 

As already stated, Taka-Diastase has ex- 
hibited remarkable results in this connection. 
In one instance a lady patient whose consti- 
pation was further complicated by dislocated 
kidneys, and who for three years had been 
unable to pass a single twenty-four hours 
without resort to an aperient, has secured 
perfect relief through Taka-Diastase. An- 
other in like condition, and a sufferer for 
years from haemorrhoids, and whose con- 
stipation was even more persistent, secured 
such relief as she never before had been able 
to attain. If space permitted, we might refer 
to half a score of males, business men, more 
or less sedentary in habits, who have found 
in Taka-Diastase a remedy that renders com- 
fortable lives hitherto considered only toler- 
able at best. 

Certain errors have been promulgated re- 
garding this new ferment: one, that it is in- 
active in the presence of acids; and another, 
that it is destroyed by the presence of an al- 
kali; consequently that it must be adminis- 
tered at a time when the reaction of the 
stomach is neutral. 

A greater error could hardly have been 
conceived, and it is based upon the theory 
that the chemistry of the test tube and that 
of the stomach must necessarily be identical. 
The chemist declares that an alkali must 
always neutralize an acid, and cites the well 
known chemical corollary regarding the com- 
mingling of these two agents; but his theories 
are entirely upset by the fact that while arti- 
ficial gastric juice in the test tube treated 
with bicarbonate of sodium is wholly neu- 
tralized, this alkali in the stomach, on the 
contrary, stimulates the flow of normal gas- 
tric juice and increases gastric activity; the 
same is true also of sodium chloride. Neither 
of these alkalies interferes with the action of 
Taka-Diastase, and the activity of the latter 
appears to be enhanced by the ingestion of 
fluids rich in malic acid. It has long been 
supposed, too, though without a shadow of 
authority, that digestion beyond the pylorus

mal secretion of the intestines is the same; 
and while there will be times even in a 
of health, when the intestinal tract will per- 
be practically neutral, it is positively 
alkaline except under conditions that 
are foreign to well-being and contrary to the 
purposes of the economy. 

Taka- Diastase, if administered prior to the 
:;on of food, is never so satisfactory as 
when the stomach has first been stimulated 
with a moderate amount of fluid followed In- 
more or less solid nourishment. In the con- 
stipation of dyspeptics and those of sedentary 
habits, this new medicament gives abundant 
evidence of being able to accomplish more 
with less tax upon functional activity than 
any agent hitherto known. 



EDITORIAL NOTES. 



"Wonders Never Cease!" 

A charlatan in central Michigan exploits 
an "invaluable pill, for many years manufac- 
tured by a well known Indian doctor who, 
etc.," and that is " warranted to cure piles, 
dyspepsia, kidney and liver complaints, female 
weakness, etc.," and in connection therewith 
has made such a notable discovery in physi- 
ology that we feel in duty bound to lay it 
before the readers of The Medical Age. 
He says: 

The gall of the liver is made from the impurity 
of the blood. This impurity is made daily for the 
ves of the stomach and kidneys, the stomach 
;he gastric juice of the gall to digest the food, 
and the kidney takes clear gal] to digest the water, 
taking from that the cloride of lime. This cloride 
of lime is a slime that feeds the rectum to 
nature's calls; without it we are troubled with o&gt;s- 
tiveness or constipated bowels; then the water is 
swc.it into the bladder by the heat of the body, and 
if the kidney does not distill it, it would sweat into 
the bladder without being distilled, and that would 
cause an inflammation of the bladder, and would 
collect sediments of sand and gravel. Until re- 
cently the pills have only been sold in the pri- 
vate practice of their inventer and by his special 
agents. The pills are now so extensively and favor- 
ably known that the proprietor has been induce 1 to

port of green ha;: : a fiction. 
As a matter of fact such colored hirsute 
adornment frequently appears among those 
employed in copper works and copper mines, 
and Bartholin drew attention to th 
far back as 1654. Recently a ca^e w, 
ported to the Johns Hopkins Medical S 
by Doctor Oppenheimer, as occurring in a 
man aged fifty eight who had been ex 
in copper works to very fine copper oxide for 
four years; he was rather uncleanly in habits, 
and was likewise "suffering from vague gas- 
tric symptoms." The hair was a "pale but 
distinct green," the color being more marked 
on the head and the beard, though, curiously 
enough, it pertained to the same growth 
throughout the surface of the body; the col- 
oring, moreover, was uniform. 

Little Difference.— 

Holloway, the arch quack, by some means 
upon one occasion thrust himself upon a 
company of gentlemen, and, presuming upon 
a slight acquaintance with Mr. ( xeorge Augus- 
tus Sala, requested the latter to introduce 
him to the author of "Vanity Fair." Mr. 
Sala did not relish the office, but finally 
the desired introduction. Thackeray mis- 
took the "Professor of Aloes" for a distin- 
guished military man and complimented him 
accordingly, whereupon Holloway, taken 
aback, blurted out who and what he was. 
Thackeray merely answered: "Oh! well, I 
made a very natural mistake, for you too 
must have killed thousands of people."

lology does not obtain better results than clin- 
|ical medicine in the great majority of cases, 
and, moreover, compromises the constitution 
of the patients." 

If the number of "straws" that are borne 
upon the breeze are indicative of anything, it 
is that the microbe fad has not only seen its 
best days, but is rapidly waning. 

Administration of Quinine.— 

This alkaloid undoubtedly exercises its best 
leffects in acid solution. But acid is some- 
times a drawback to the exhibition of the 
ijdrug in this form, while with many the intense 
[bitterness that supervenes becomes a perma- 
nent objection. By obtaining the crystals in 
their entirety, or after they have been reduced 
(to an impalpable powder, and enclosing in the 
[convenient gelatin capsule, the drug obtains 
[speedy release and solution in the stomach; 
solution will, moreover, be aided by the fluid 
imbibed in swallowing the capsule. 

Nuclein in Gonorrhoea.— 

Recently several instances have been re- 
ported to the editor of this journal wherein 
Nuclein has with unprecedented success been 
:employed in this malady — a malady that 
generally is a bete noire to practitioners. 

These statements are well substantiated 
but appear almost "too good to be true," 
'and it is to be hoped that subsequent events 
will prove this evidence based on something 
more than coincidence. In the meantime 
further developments are eagerly awaited.

In the legal controversy between these 
parties, the former scored a decided suc- 
cess, and the latter has been permanently 
enjoined from manufacturing "animal ex-

Columbia Chemical stock, and seeking to 
sell Sanitarium stock, the "Great Retired" 
endeavored to "do" the Chemical Company 
by depriving it of its rights of ownership in

Hahnemannianism versus Regular.— 

As to the doctrine of potentization, in view 
of the methods at present employed in the 
various Pasteur institutes and in the prepara- 
tion of the antitoxins, it would seem that 
there is nothing very strange, and certainly 
nothing irrational, about it. ... Granted 
even that this doctrine were rejected, it is a 
Hahnemannianism, not intrinsic in homoe- 
opathy, which, as its name expresses, has 
only to do with the principle guiding in the 
choice of a remedy. 

As to "curious" homoeopathic remedies, 
we grant that when it comes to advertising 
potentized moonshine we might hesitate to 
defend it, or might be willing to condemn it 
absolutely were it not that various " regular " 
physicians have demonstrated that of the 
solar light the red ray has the most beneficial 
effect upon the progress of smallpox. When 
reference is made to the preparations from 
the pustule of smallpox, we retort by pointing 
to the whole serum therapy over which there 
is at present so much jubilation, and we 
hardly know which to. prefer, the domestic 
cimex of the homoeopath or the testicular 
juice of the other side. If we have the pole- 
cat, they use musk. The number of such 
substances used has nothing to do with the 
relative absurdity or wisdom of their em- 
ployment, for if the principle of their allow- 
ability be acknowledged, the greater their 
number the more praiseworthy the one intro- 
ducing them. 

Personally we think the time for pitting 
the medical schools against each other is 
past. "By their fruits ye shall know them." 
We are perfectly willing to leave the whole 
question to the practical horse-sense of the 
public. We find extremists on both sides — 
ultra spectral rays — who need not bother us, 
though their influence is felt. We do not 
advocate amalgamation, nor anything like it, 
but we do advocate a standpoint above that 
of either sect, a higher plane, upon which the 
elect of all schools may even now meet, but 
which will ever remain a terra incognita, an 
unthinkable No-Man's Land, with all bigots, 
rank and file. — Hahnemannian Monthly. 

Butter vs. Margarine.— 

The great drawback to all efforts to pro- 
cure legislation for pure food comes from 
misguided though earnest advocates; and 
this is especially true in the contest that has 
been waged to secure control of the oleo- 
margarine trade. Instead of facts and argu- 
ments, fictions and vilifications have been

nutritive powers. — A pound of good oleo may

one of good butter. Were I eating glycerids

How Notoriety is Secured.— 

We learn from the American Visitors' A 
and Register, June 14th, 1895, that "Doctor 
Blank, the distinguished ophthalmic surgeon, 

of , U. S. A., is in London visiting the 

hospitals in view of demonstrating his im- 
proved operation for cataract." 

At what London hospital has he given a 
demonstration? The paragraph continues: 

"He is accompanied by his wife and son, 
and will leave for the Continent shortly. 
They will tour France, Germany, Scotland, 
Belgium, Austria, and England, in the interest 
of science, returning to America about Octo- 
ber 1st." 

This paragraph will injure Doctor Blank if 
he is a distinguished surgeon, and if he is 
not it will secure a certain degree of notoriety 
which may bring him clients. — Provincial

Book Reviews, 



Littell's Living Age. Price, 20 cents; $8.00 a year. 
Littell &amp; Co., Boston. 

At this time, while other magazines are 
pressing their claims to the favor of the pub- 
lic, LitteWs Living Age certainly should not be 
forgotten by those who know what its ser- 
vices have been in the spread of the best of 
periodical literature throughout the Conti- 
nent. The four issues of the month of July 
have been extremely interesting, dealing with 
almost every range of literature — fiction, 
poetry, science, travel, geography, astron- 
omy, etc. No better exhibit can be found of 
Lhe progress and exposition of thought in the 
different fields of literature, politics and sci- 
ence than by an appeal to Littell's Living Age. 
Each volume is a mirror reflecting the lead- 
ling literature of the months it covers. Con- 
sidering the vast quantity and high quality of 
;he contents of the yearly numbers, which 
'iform large octavo volumes of nearly nine 
hundred pages each, the price is extremely 
modest. The publishers, also, as an induce- 
•ment to those who may desire to make a 
tibial subscription, offer the twenty-six num- 
bers forming the half-year ending with June, 
: or $3.00. It is further offered, in considera- 
tion of $6.00 in payment for nine months, to 
jend the thirteen numbers forming the first 
quarterly volume of the year, free. 



Duting. Price, 25 cents; $3.00 a year. The Out- 
ing Company, New York. 

The August number opens with a strong, 
complete story, "In a Field of Buckwheat," 
Dy Jean Porter Rudd, in which the author ad- 
mirably draws pen pictures of Alpine peasant 
life. Other notable features are: "The Cup 
Champions of 1895," and " Polo in the West." 
In comparing the crack yachts the author 
displays a thorough knowledge of his sub- 
ject, and his comparisons are further ex- 
plained by a series of diagrams and by a 
lumber of fine photos of t^e gallant " De- 
fender" and the ambitious "Valkyre III." 
The polo article is profusely illustrated and 
:ontains much useful information on the 
progress of the dashing game in the prairie 
country. 



The Atlantic Monthly. Price, 35 cents; $4.00 a 
year. Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co., Boston. 

In the August issue appear: "A Singular

Phelps; "Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar," by 
Darwin E. Ware; "An Architect's Vacation," 
by Robert Swain Peabody; " Godfrey's Cove," 



by John H. Ingham; "Life of a French 
'Macon,'" by J. M. Ludlow; "A Talk I 
Autographs," by George B. Hill; "Thrift,"

Morse; and "The Seats of the Mighty," 
chapters xiv-xv, by Gilbert Parker. 



Travel. Price, 10 cents; $1.00 a year. Travel 
Publishing Company, Xevv York. 

This is the former or old Magazine of 
Travel under a new title and with a new- 
price. Instead of being $2 a year as it was 
formerly, it now enters the lists as a $1 mag- 
azine. It contains for July: "Jedburgh and 
Kelso," by Clinton Scollard; "Hunting from 
a Palace Car," by Abbie E. Marble; " Floren- 
tine Days," by Florence H. Morgan; "The 
Engineer," by J. P. Barnitz;

The contents of the August number are 
more attractive than ever, in the elaborate 
display of illustrative art as an ornamental 
accompaniment to a large number of inter- 
esting papers on a variety of subjects. We 
are sincerely appreciative of such artistic re- 
sult, and for this reason would desire this 
beautiful monthly to be on the table of all 
our readers. We also note that the publica- 
tion of a magazine purely literary in charac- 
ter has been undertaken by Mr. Jones, which 
latter fact alone ensures success. 



Lippincott's Magazine. Price, 25 cents; S3. 00 a

This lexicon is constructed on original 
plans, designed to give, in complete and ac- 
curate statement, in the light of the most 
recent advances in knowledge, and in the 
readiest form for popular use, the orthogra- 
phy, pronunciation, meaning and etymology 
of all the words, and the meanings of idiom- 
atic phrases in the speech and literature, of 
the Knglish-speaking people. It embodies 
many new principles in lexicography and 
contains 5,000 illustrations made expressly 
for this work. It is said to contain 301,865 
vocabulary terms, or about 75,000 more than 
any other dictionary of the language, and to 
have cost nearly a million dollars. 

It is impossible in the space at command to 
give the detailed and comprehensive review 
which so vast an undertaking deserves. But 
it is a work which should be on the shelf of 
every lover of literature, every student of the 
English language, every inquirer after the 
meaning and significance of words. 



The Aseptic Treatment of Wounds. By Doctor 
C. Schimmelbusch. Translated by Frank J. 
Thornburw M.D. Cloth; Svo; pp. 233. Price, 
&gt;2.oo. New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons. 

This work certainly fills a place in medical 
literature hitherto unoccupied in America. 
To be sure, several little monographs have 
been put forth, but always without any evi- 
dence of originality or direct knowledge on 
the part of the authors, being at best but 
mere compilations where even sound judg- 
ment was more or less at fault. This work 
of Schimmelbusch, however, covers the entire 
ground in the most complete and thorough 
manner; even the minute details are thor- 
oughly worked out, and the illustrations ren- 



der valuable aid in elucidating the character 
of the text. 

;e who have the fear of mici 
. before their eyes this worl 
undoubted a most excellent purpose; 

and even those who do not uphold all the 
minuteness of detail in wound I 

ment will find much that will add . 
the convenience of their work, even wi 
going into the extreint ilization.

Cloth; i2mo; pp. 461. Pr: 
.'. M. Scudder't Sons, Cincinnati. 

This is practically a compendium of the 
lectures delivered in the Cincinnati M&lt; 
Institute by Professor Locke, suppleni- 
by new therapeutical matter, pharmacologi- 
cal notes, etc. It is by no means an epitome 
of either materia medica or therapeutics, how- 
ever, nor is it intended to be. While the 
work is creditable in so far as it goes, we 
must deprecate the issuing of such, since 
the purpose is less the education of the 
student in medicine than the fitting of him 
for the final examination prior to graduation. 
It goes without saying, that our eclectic 
friends are not obliged to resort to such 
measures, and it is especially creditable to 
them that they are no way responsible for the 
origination of literature of this type. 






A Freak in Finance. By J. F. Cargill. Paper; 
i2mo; pp. 142. Price, 25 cents. Rand, McNally 
cV Co., Chicago. 

This, number 202 of the "Globe Library,' 
is a complete and thorough refutation of the 
heresies that are promulgated in the work 
known as Coin's Financial School. It takes 
up the very points which the latter work de- 
liberately slurs over, or entirely ignores, in 
the presentation of financial problems, and is 
as a whole a very complete and succinct ac- 
count of financial measures and their results 
during the last century, not only in the 
United States, i&gt;ut abroad. We wish this 
book could be placed in the hands of every 
man or youth throughout the country, inas- 
much as it presents a complete solution of 
the problems that are now worrying the 
masses.

We are informed by the author that, though 
this is a work of fiction, the plot is founded

jthe majority of the misdeeds cited are fairly 
chargeable to him, and he "actually did many 
jother things more remarkable, but too im-

exemplifies in some measure the claim of the 
late Doctor Charles Lever, who was wont to 
declare that truj:h was far stranger than fiction, 
jand that what was most improbable in any 
work was apt to be the very portion founded 
on fact. The book holds the interest of the

Cloth; 8vo; pp. 200. Price, 75 cents. Howard 
Publishing Co., Detroit. 

Another volume of Doctor Owen's transla- 
tion of the Cipher Story is at hand. The 
Iwhole theory, plan and process in the publi- 
cation of these curious and perhaps mar- 
vellous volumes have been so thoroughly 
[described that it seems useless to make fur- 
ther allusion thereto. This volume is a con- 
tinuation of Bacon's life in France, perfecting 
[the details of his parentage, etc., along with 
[much other matter of historical moment. 

A noteworthy fact in connection with this 
volume is that Doctor Owen never saw a line 
■ it until it appeared in print. The transla- 
tion was made from Doctor Owen's wheel by 
|poung ladies in the office. 



The Annual of Eclectic Medicine and Surgery 
for 1894. Volume V. By John V. Stevens. 
Cloth; 8vo; pp. 383. Price, $3.20. John V. 
Stevens, Chicago. 

This is a very complete epitome of ad- 
vanced medical thought and experience from 
an eclectic standpoint. The work embraces 
under one cover the most meritorious papers 
read at the meetings of the various State 
societies, which are thus preserved and form 
a valuable reference library of the researches, 
observations and experiences of the ablest 
eclectic practitioners. A voluminous and 
carefully arranged index is a very valuable 
addition. The work is one that can be recom- 
mended to any and every practitioner, as it 
contains a great deal of material of most 
practical value. 



Excessive Venery. By Joseph W. Howe, M.D. 
Cloth; i2mo; pp. 299. Price, $2.75. E. B. 
Treat, New York. 

This volume contains the substance of a 
course of lectures originally delivered in the 
Medical Department of the University of 
New York. In addition to the results of 
personal experience obtained in hospital and 
private practice, the author has added the 



peculiar methods of the treatment employed 
by various authorities in Europe and America, 
thus making a complete work of reference 
for both the student and practitioner. Al- 
though the volume has been before the medi- 
cal profession since 1887, it is perhaps the 
best of the books of its class, and certainly is 
devoid of many objectionable features that 
pertain to most. 



SKIASCOPY. By Edward Jackson, A.M., M.D. 
Cloth; 8vo; pp. 112. Price, $i.o». The Edwards 
and Docker Co., Philadelphia. 

This work was prepared in order to give 
more complete information regarding, and 
assist in the general adoption, of skiascopy 
as an essential part of the examination of 
ametropia. The claims made for this pro- 
cedure are: that it is the most active objec- 
tive test independent of the patient's intelli- 
gence, acuteness,. or cooperation; that it 
requires little more time than the use of the 
refraction ophthalmoscope or the opthalmom- 
eter, and moreover gives better informa- 
tion; finally, that it lays before the surgeon 
the refraction in each particular part ot the 
pupil as it is revealed by no other test. 



Thoughts on Religion. By George John Romanes, 
M.A., LL.D., F.R.S. Edited by Charles Gore, 
M.A. Cloth; i6mo; pp. 195. Price, $1.25. The 
Open Court Publishing Co., Chicago. 

The book will create a sensation, for it 
shows that Professor Romanes was possessed 
of an eagerness to believe, but was still un- 
able to overcome the objections made by 
science to religion. The volume consequently 
is an evidence of the importance of the re- 
ligious problem. Canon Charles Gore, of 
Westminster, publishes these notes in con- 
nection with his own editorial comments. 



De l'Agrandissement Momentane du Bassin. By 
Adolphe pinard. Paper; 8vo; pp. 59. G. Stein- 
heil, Paris, France. 

The author of this brochure briefly sets 
forth the anatomy and physiology of the 
sacro-iliac articulations before and after sym- 
physiotomy, the advantages of the operation, 
its technique, etc. 



Handbook of Diseases of the Eye. By Doctor A. 
Eugen Fick. 

This most complete, thorough, and compact of 
text-books has been translated by Doctor Albert B. 
Hall, of Chicago, and will speedily appear from 
the press of P. Blakiston, Son &amp; Co. Among its 
other merits it contains a number of very hand- 
some and practical colored illustrations that will 
greatly aid the student and be of much service to 
the practitioner. The price will be $3 to $4.

Therapeutic Brevities.

injuries are done to male or female by the

Kolb and myself have found that ai

on the breathing or. 
dumb bells and other e.v - s where the 
muscles are moved without progression of 
the body, tell most on the muscles; wh: 51 
climbing and long pedestrian feats it is the 
nervous system that is most given to suffer. 
There is not a cycle-rider of any age in whom 
the heart is not influenced so as to do more 
work, and although in skilled and trained 
Sts a certain balance is set up which 
equalizes the motion, such riders are not 
exempt from danger. I have known the 
beats of the heart to rise from eighty t&lt;i two 
hundred in the minute, in the first exercise of 
riding, an increase which, for the time, more 
than doubles the amount of work done — a 
very serious fact when we remember that the 
extreme natural motion of the heart allows 
it to perform a task equal to raising not less 
than one hundred and twenty-two foot-tons 
in the course of twenty-four hours — that is 
to say, over five foot-tons an hour. In the 
young the heart is undergoing its develop- 
ment, and is an organ which cannot without 
danger be whipped on beyond its -natural 
pace. What occurs with it under such cir- 
cumstances is that it grows larger than it 
ought to grow, that it works out of harmony 
with the rest of the body, and is then most 
easily agitated by influences and impressions 
acting upon it through the mind. I have 
many times seen this truth illustrated too 
plainly, and I doubt whether in the young, 
after extreme exercise, such as that which 
arises from a prolonged race, the heart ever 
comes down to its natural beat in a period 
of less than three days devoted to repose.

American Review, 



New Preparation of Cannabis. — R. Cowan 
Lees,*f Glasgow, has had excellent results 
from the use of a strong aqueous extract of 
the flowering tops of the female plant, of the 
usual strength of liquid extracts. It possesses 
the anodyne and soporific action generally 
ascribed to the resinous extract, although, in 
a modified degree; has the characteristic 
odor of hemp, and a beautiful deep-amber 
color; is miscible with water, and hence there

tion and constipation. The dose commonly I 
used is one-half fluidrachm (two grammes) for I 
an adult, though it may be increased to a full 
drachm. — British Medical Journal. 



Fruit in Dysentery. — I desire to draw atten- 
tion to the value of certain sorts of fresh fruit 
in chronic dysentery. Personal and profes- 
sional experience shows that such are of the 
greatest value. I may specify strawberries, 
grapes, figs, and, if they can be so classed, 
tomatoes, these being all seed-fruits as dis- 
tinguished from stone-fruits — of course they 
must be in absolutely good condition. For 
some years past I have made use of these 
largely in treating chronic dysentery and di- 
arrhoea, with most happy results. The idea 
is not original, but was impressed on me by 
the late Doctor Sausmarez Lacy, of the Island 
of Guernsey, who, I believe, had practiced 
this treatment for many years. — Doctor 
Arthur DeButts, in The Lancet (London). 



I have had fair experience with dysentery 
abroad, and when an acute case in a patient 
apparently otherwise healthy comes under 
my care, and threatens to become chronic, I 
look for malarial or scorbutic complication. 
Quinine in the one instance, or lime-juice 
with fresh fruits or vegetables in the other, 
quickly alleviates the symptoms. I believe 
most cases of chronic dysentery are, to a 
great extent, due to malaria or scurvy when 
contracted abroad. — Doctor J. S. MQJ 
Cut chan, in British Medical Journal. 



Alkalinity of Urine. — Alkaline urine is ren- 
dered acid by inhalations of amyl nitrite Aj 
such urine generally presents an excess of 
phosphates (when the alkalinity is not caused 
by fermentation in the bladder, by pus, or by 



THE MEDICAL AGE.

catarrh of the urinary organs), it is pretty- 
evident there is some disease of the nerve 
centres; hence, turning by the inhalation 
shows that the acid change is owing, most 
probably, to vaso-dilator influences, because 
this medicament has a powerful stimu- 
lating influence on centres which promote 
vaso-dilator influences, or bring such about. 
The effect is mostly on the arterioles and 
capillaries, whose walls relax and admit much 
larger quantities of blood, thus making the 
vascular areas hyperaemic. The influence is 
on the basilar brain and cord; the muscles 
are therefore largely supplied with blood, 
and their nutrition increased. Uric acid is 
also passed in large quantities under this 
stimulus. — Doctor Joseph Adolphus, in 
Atnerican Medical Journal. 



Abortion of Gonorrhoea. — Guiard's method 
of frequently washing out the urethra with 
weak solutions of potassium permanganate 
is certainly the most effective way to abort 
gonorrhoea. It requires a vessel of a capacity 
of about two imperial pints for holding the 
'solution; attached to this is a rubber tube six 
feet in length, fitted with a glass cannula and 
tap, so arranged as to be controlled by the 
same hand that holds the nozzle in the penis. 
If the inflammation is confined to the ante- 
rior urethra, only one or two drachms are 
allowed to flow in, and then immediately 
voided. About half a pint is the utmost that 
should be used at one sitting. The best re- 
sults are obtained with weak solutions — for 
example, i to 10,000, the maximum being 1 
to 5,000. There should be two irrigations on 
the first, second, and fourth days. On the 
third and last four days of the eight days' 
treatment, only a single washing-out is ad- 
vised. The results obtained are very satis- 
factory. The stains produced by the per- 
manganate solution may be remdved by a 
twenty-per-cent. solution of soda-bisulphide. 
— Charlotte Medical Journal, 



Lubricants in Gynaecology. — A lubricant 
should be aseptic and non-irritating, and 
glycerin is undoubtedly the best base, but a 
superior quality is essential. Dudley em- 
ploys a glycerin lubricant kept in metallic 
tubes like those which envelop oil colors. — 
The tube is essential, as an open jar of lubri- 
cant allows the compound itself to be con- 
taminated by the unclean finger of a careless 
operator. Dudley's compound consists of 
glycerin, starch, powdered tragacanth, boric 
acid, and oil of wintergreen. The finger or 
instrument upon which this is applied should 



.be dry, else it does not adhere well. It is a 
perfect lubricant, non-irritant, antiseptic, and 
deodorant, not greasy, and readily washed 
off; even after digital examination of ex- 
tremely foul and foetid malignant ulcerations, 
the odor (usually so persistent) may be re- 
moved by placing the hand under a stream 
of water. By its cleansing and healing 
effects it counteracts any tendency to chap- 
ping of the hands, a serious disadvantage in 
large private and out-patient practice. — 
Homoeopathic News. 



Chlorosis. — Carl van Noorden remarks: 
" Most chlorotic girls feel weakest and most 
worn out during the hours of the forenoon. 
The best remedy is the English fashion of a 
good hearty meal at the beginning of the 
day." He advises chlorotic girls to drink 
half a liter of milk of the best quality while 
still in bed, and to do it very slowly, taking 
fifteen minutes to ingest the quantity pre- 
scribed; half an hour later to rise and be 
rubbed with a dry, rough woolen towel. 
Then breakfast — a small cup of tea, one or 
two slices of buttered toast, and plenty of 
meat; two hours and a half later some bread 
and butter, together with two eggs, followed 
by a quarter of a liter of milk. A glass of 
sherry is now permissible if special reasons 
warrant it. The morning regulation of diet 
makes the forenoon hours quite comfortable. 
Fixed rules for other meals are of less im- 
portance. — Medical and Surgical Reporter. 



Nuclein in Tuberculosis. — Doctor F. W. Gar- 
ber cites ten cases of tuberculosis, one of neur- 
asthenia, one of follicular tonsillitis, and one 
of troublesome sinus with phlegmonous cellu- 
litis induced by a sloughing tendon leading 
from the second finger high into the palm of 
the hand, all benefited by Vaughan's Nu- 
clein. He concludes it is of value in incipient 
tuberculosis; whether positively curative or 
not he is yet in no position to say, but be- 
lieves by its early use it is possible, to give 
patients a longer lease of life and very much 
more comfort. If the patient be in position 
to take advantage of favorable climatic con- 
ditions, he has great faith in the complete 
restoration to health by the use of Nuclein of 
a large number of persons now dying under 
other treatment. — Medical and Surgical Re-

Phthisis Pulmonalis. — Carasso especially 
recommends Peppermint oil in conjunction 
with Creosote in pulmonary tuberculosis. 
He orders taken every three hours during the 
day:

Alcohol. 125 Gm.

Potassium Bichromate. — This drug has a 
specific effect upon catarrh of the bronchi, 
both in the acute and chronic forms, and will 
be found of great benefit in catarrhal condi- 
tions of any of the mucous membranes. In 
gastric catarrh it acts admirably, especially 
if tenderness on pressure over the epigastrium 
is a marked symptom. In chronic gastric 
ulcer great confidence may be placed in it; 
a very small dose, from one-sixteenth to one- 
twelfth of a grain, given upon an empty 
stomach, will answer the purpose. This 
agent will well repay careful investigation, 
and is without doubt a most useful remedy.

Duboisine as an Anti-fat. — In the adminis- 
tration of Duboisine, either by the mouth or 
hypodermatically for the purpose of observing 
its specific effects upon the various organs of 
the body and their functions, it has been ob- 
served that, for whatever purpose, or however 
administered, it induces emaciation. It is a 
sedative to the nervous system, and diminishes 
all excretion. It has an undesirable effect 
upon the stomach when taken for a long time. 
But the persistent and almost invariable loss 
of flesh suggests that in those conditions 
where adiposis must be reduced, this agent 
mav be valuable. — Medical Press. 



THE MEDICAL AGE.

Good Hints. — If a child has fever of any 
kind, or bowel trouble, always offer it water 
before giving milk or offering the breast. — A 
child often takes milk which its stomach re- 
pels, because it is thirsty: 

If the sick-room is hot, the temperature 
can be lowered several degrees by hanging 
up sheets which have been wrung out of cold 
water, and repeating when dry: 

The mouth and teeth should be washed 
two or three times daily with salt and water 
when there is fever, and the lips anointed 
with vaselin to prevent cracking. — V. E. 
Lawrence, in Medical Brief. 



Locomotor Ataxia. — It is vital that the affec- 
tion be treated in its incipiency, and to that 
end I would direct attention to the earliest 
symptoms, namely: Isolated paralysis of 
the external eye muscles; the occurrence of 
the Argyl-Robertson pupil; the appearance of 
optic atrophy with inequality of the pupils; 
vertigo and staggering; and, as sometimes 
coincident with these and most frequently 
closely following them, gastric crises or par- 
oxysmal vomiting; lancinating pains in lower 
extremities, and absence of the patellar ten- 
don reflex.— Doctor Reber, in Lehigh Val- 
ley Medical Magazine. 



Application of Leeches. — The application of 
leeches to the temple is often of great service 
in relieving pain and subduing inflammation 
in the eyes and their appendages. The leech 
is best applied by putting it in a large test 
tube partly filled with water. When this is 
tilted so that its open end and the mouth of 
the animal come in contact with the skin of 
the temple, the leech feels so much at home 
in his native element that he promptly bites 
the skin when he touches it, and sucks him- 
self full of blood. — Universal Medical Journal. 



The Murphy Button. — Doctor John A. 
Wyeth, before the Tri-State Medical Asso- 
ciation, expressed the opinion that the safest 
method for intestinal anastomosis is to be 
found in the Czerny-Lembert silk suture. 
The main objections to the Murphy button 
he finds in the small calibre of the lumen of 
the bowel at the point of union, the weight 
of the button pressing on contiguous tissues, 
and the liability of obstruction from plug- 
ging. — Pittsburg Medical Review. 



Treatment of Goitre by Thyroid. — Professor 
Bruns has just published the result of his 
treatment of twelve persons affected with 
goitre by ingestion of Thyroid. Of the 



total number, nine were either cured or con- 
siderably relieved. Four children between 
the ages of four and twelve were also com- 
pletely relieved; in a fifth case the goitre 
was accompanied by a cyst, and while the 
former was removed the cyst remained un- 
affected. — Medical Record. 



Taka- Diastase in Diabetes. — Lepine records 
the result of the treatment of four cases of 
diabetes mellitus with a ferment prepared 
from malt. In all there was distinct improve- 
ment. The excretion of sugar averaged in 
each about 140 grammes every twenty-four 
hours, but under the use of Taka-Diastase 
the average was reduced to 70 grammes. 
Taka-Diastase is not diuretic; it has no in- 
jurious effects, but the improvement is only 
temporary. — Medical Week. 



Vesical Lrritability. — Doctor Schun de- 
clares that when irritation of bladder arises 
from excess of phosphates in the urine, the 
following alleviates the frequent desire to 
urinate: 



B Benzoic acid, 8.00 gramme. 
Borax, 7.50 gramme. 
Water, 225.000 gramme. 



■Le Scalpel. 



Localized Meningitis. — Place a small can- 
tharidal blister (one inch square) upon the 
point of greatest pain, and keep the resultant 
sore active by the compound resin-cerate for 
three or four days. Occasionally a second 
blistering is necessary, but no internal medi- 
cation is required. — Doctor Burr, in Phila- 
delphia Polyclinic. 



Varicella. — In adults, in many instances, 
this malady is more likely to be overlooked 
than in a child, because the general symp- 
toms of malaise are not so prominent. Adults 
will, in most instances, go about their daily 
work, and only occasionally is the tempera- 
ture found to be high. — Doctor Cantrell. 



Obstinate Tonsillitis. — Sodium sal icy late 
should not be overlooked in treating obsti- 
nate attacks of tonsillitis, as some rheumatic 
element is possible. — Gaillaras Medical Jour- 
nal. 



Vomiting of Pregnancy. — The latest remedy 
is a twenty-per-cent. solution of Menthol in 
olive oil. The dose is ten drops on sugar 
when the nausea appears. — Journal of Mi i-

characteristic manner when the lower end

hands. The question naturally arose as 
to whether this was a case of incipient Bright's 
disease or of mechanically produced albumi- 
nuria. An eminent London authority on renal 
(and many other) diseases decided in favor of 
the second alternative, and advised the con- 
tinuance of the pad and belt which the patient 
was wearing. The symptoms generally im- 
proved; albumen was frequently absent from 
the urine, and the patient was mentally re- 
lieved by the knowledge that the indefinite 
symptoms were due to a mechanical condition 
and not to some mysterious disease. It is 
now three years and a half since I first saw 
him, and I gather from his letters that the 
mertfal and bodily conditions are both more 
satisfactory now than then. 

My first female case was an ayah traveling 
in Europe. She was seized with renal colic, 
and the attack was followed by a copious dis- 
charge of gravel. She had had one or two 
similar attacks previously, and the kidney was 
very movable. I attributed the accumula- 
tion of gravel and consequent colic to dislo- 
cation of the kidney. A pad was applied, 
but I have no further record of the patient. 

I met with another case in a young lady 
traveling with a trusted maid as companion. 
The maid had been instructed to pay as little 
attention as possible to the complaints of the 
young lady. The latter called on me one day 
complaining of pain in the right iliac region. 
She had a history of recent gastric catarrh.

Recently I have met with two ca^&lt; 
movable kidney, both in young wome: 
both associated with localized pain, neuralgia,, 
and derangement of bowels. One patient 
family history of malignant dis- 
much relieved w '.ainedl 

the cause of her symptoms. The second hadj 

e ideas of incipient something, am 
glad to know that even if the symptoms were 
progressive there was a fairly certain means 
of permanent cure. 

The following considerations seem to me 
worthy of attention: 

That though the individual symptoms — 
namely, localized pain, mental depression,' 
neuralgia, and intestinal irregularity — are 
indefinite, yet when associated they form a 
fairly characteristic clinical picture: 

That the pain is often not in the kidney 
itself, but in the structures irritated by its 
abnormal mobility, of which the genito- 
crural nerve appears to be an important one, 
and may possibly be the afferent tract where 
reflex neuralgia is a prominent symptom: 

All my female cases (possibly excepting 
the ayah) were nulliparous women, and 
have been unable to trace any causal rela- 
tionship with tight lacing; on the other hand, 
four of the cases occurred in patients who 
had indulged in violent exercise, such a&lt; 
running down the Righi to Viznau, donkey- 
riding, pony-riding, and pedestrianism gener- 
ally: 

What treatment short of operative inter- 
ference is likely to lead to permanent relief 
or cure? The prospect of wearing a pad 
indefinitely is not satisfactory; to forbid ex- 
ercise is paving the way to troubles innumer- 
able; and to treat symptoms is to beg the 
question of treatment altogether. Recently 
I have prescribed exercises with a view to 
strengthening the lumbar and abdominal 
muscles, together with a liberal diet and ap- 
propriate treatment of the digestive organs.

Cemeteries and Typhoid. — Whether a 
burial ground shall or shall not be a danger 
to the health of the surrounding population

may change in course of time. When inter-

ments are carried out with proper care, and 
the ground is covered with grass and trees, 
there is no danger to be apprehended from 
emanations; even in the ground air the pre- 
dominant gas is carbonic acid. The chief 
danger consists in the probable contamina- 
tion of the ground water and water supply, 
and this is directly connected with the nature 
of the soil as regards its permeability to air 
and water, and its richness or otherwise in 
the bacteria of nitrification. In light, sandy 
loams decomposition and the resolution of 
the corpse into salts and gases proceeds so 
rapidly that almost every trace of the soft 
parts is gone in a dozen years or less, with 
little or no offense; while, on the other hand, 
in a cold, stiff clay, a putrid, stinking mass 
remains for fifty years or more, and in a dead 
earth, such as one meets with in the heart of 
cities, there is no decomposition at all; in 
St. Andrew's (Holborn) churchyard, bodies 
buried two hundred years ago were found 
"sandwiched" between the crushed coffins, 
little more disintegrated than those buried just 
before the graveyard was closed twenty years 
before the excavations. In clay soils, seams 
of sand act as drains, carrying the soakage 
from the graves to the nearest water-course, 
and especially when the cemetery is on a 
hillside; and deep interment, far from re- 
ducing the danger, greatly intensifies it by 
removing the corpse beyond the nitrifying 
influence of the bacteria. Doctor F. Levison, 
of Copenhagen, has recently called attention 
to the recurrence of epidemics of enteric 
fever in a particular quarter of Copenhagen 
where the houses abut on the only partially 
covered outfall sewer, which receives with 
other sewage the drainage from a large 
cemetery. The severest by far of these epi- 
demics broke out in 1880, when during some 
works the sewage — having been dammed 
back — left a semi-dried and most offensive 
deposit; the next heaviest occurred in 1884. 
Fliigge has called special attention to the 
relation between the sand seams — or land 
springs, as they are called in this country — 
and.wells; and Levison considers that only 
forty-five of the six hundred and fifty ceme- 
teries in Denmark are objectionably situated, 
while of those around London we doubt if 
there are three. — Sanitary Record. 



rien {para-pylorique) the formation develops 
in the first portion of the duodenum, and 
presents a symptomatology almost identical 
with that of pyloric cancer. In cancer sous- 
vaterien (prce-Jejuna/e), besides the symptoms 
accompanying stenosis of the pylorus, there 
are signs indicating a reflux of bile and pan- 
creatic juice into the stomach. In cancer 
.peri-vaterien the symptoms approach more or 
less to one or the other of the above forms. 

Among the cancers peri-ampullaires the au- 
thor groups not only the cancers of the duo- 
denum which affect the ampulla of Vater, but 
those also which are situated in the neigh- 
borhood, and those which in their develop- 
ment involve the ampulla. Some of these 
cannot be distinguished clinically from the 
ordinary examples of duodenal cancer, but 
some may be distinguished by evidences re- 
sembling pancreatic carcinoma. 

Pathologically, these growths usually pre- 
sent narrowing or contraction of the gut at 
the level of the cancer, with dilatation above 
it, sometimes involving the stomach itself, 
and frequently accompanied by insufficiency 
of the pyloric valve. Histologically, there 
appear to be as many varieties of cancer of 
the duodenum as there are different kinds of 
cells entering into the formation of this seg- 
ment of the digestive tract. 

In diagnosis the difficulty varies according 
to the position of the new-growth. In the 
form immediately beyond the pylorus it is 
usually impossible, but in the other situations 
it is sometimes possible. Primary duodenal 
cancer has to be differentiated from supra- 
duodenal, or pyloric, and infra-duodenal sten- 
osis, and those conditions of constriction 
dependent on extrinsic causes, such as com- 
pression by surrounding structures. 

The topographical diagnosis is of the great- 
est importance from the point of view of 
operative interference, which differs accord- 
ing to the seat of the growth in the duodenum. 
But when the diagnosis is impossible, explor- 
atory laparotomy constitutes the first measure 
necessary for surgical intervention, which, 
however, in the greater number of instances 
cannot be more than palliative. — Adriex Pic, 
in Revue de Medecine. 



Duodenal Cancer. — Primary cancer of 
the duodenum, like primary cancer of the 
intestinal tract generally, has, in the large 
majority of cases, an annular form, and thus 
most frequently produces stenosis; the sten- 
otic symptoms vary according to the level at 
which the growth occurs. In cancer sus-vate-

The Juices of the Stomach. — Doctor 
Fremont, of Vichy, has recently been con- 
ducting experiments on dogs with a view to 
determining the properties of the various 
juices secreted by the stomach. He estab- 
lishes continuity between the oesophagus and 
the duodenum, and, as soon as the adven- 
titious channel is in working order, applies 
ligatures round the cardiac and pyloric ori- 
fices of the stomach, with which a fistulous 
communication can now be made from the 
outside. The animals support this in a sur- 
prisingly nonchalant way, and M. Fremont 
was consequently able to carry out direct ob- 
servations regarding the mode of action of 
several medicaments, as well as on the di- 
gestibility of various articles of food. For 
instance, lie was able to show that bicarbon- 
ate of soda excites the pouring forth of the 
gastric juice; subnitrate of bismuth has the 
effect of diminishing all the secretions in 
quantity; a milk regimen serves to lessen the 
amount of watery exudation; finally, these 
animals tolerated a two-per-thousand solution 
of muriatic acid.

Fi RILS &lt;&gt;i ACROBATISM. — Clowns and 
tortionists are not a long-lived class. Not 
only do they strain nature unduly in the ex- 
ercise of their avocations, but, as a rule, they 
also demand too much from their dig 
and excretory organs in the matter of alco 
hoi. Professor Ouenu recently relieved a 
clown of two aneurysms by extirpation, onel 
being situated on the right iliac artery andP 
the other on the left femoral. In the first 
case the external iliac artery had to be tied 
above the tumor as a preliminary measure, 
as well as the profunda, the muscular, and 
the circumflex iliac below; in the second, not 
only were the same vessels ligated both 
above and below, but the femoral vein was 
also resected for a considerable portion of its 
course. The clown recovered, but had to 
abandon acrobatism. — Provincial M

Academy of Medicine, described a ptomaine 
extracted from the urine of a cancerous pa- 
tient — a white substance, which crystallizes 
in needles, and dissolves in water with an 
alkaline reaction; it gives a brown reaction 
to Wessler's reagent; moreover, it is highly 
poisonous, and injected into the veins leads 
to fever and death in about three hours. It 
is not present in normal urine. — British J/c.i-

THE HONROE DOCTRINE APPLIED TO THE 
PHYSICIAN. 

BY ORVILLE W. OWEN, M.D.* 

Is it not about time for the medical profes- 
sion to insist that the fundamental principle 
of non-interference by Europe should be in- 
corporated in our medical journals, when from 
fifty to sixty per cent, of published articles 
are taken from European sources — when in- 
ventions and discoveries made by American 
physicians are either passed by or slightly 
noticed, until some foreigner republishes 
them as his own; when American graduates 
are treated with undeserved contempt, until 
a course has been taken in Germany or 
France? Is it not time to call a halt, and 
force recognition of our own merits ? 

If the medical profession of this great 
country is so poor in mental endowments that 
editors must look for articles in European 
centres, let us find it out. But that of all 
the professions ours should be the one that 
has not advanced, is as untenable as any 
other fiction. 

America has advanced in one century as 
far as Europe in ten centuries; within our 
borders mental growth has kept pace with 
natural progression, and to-day our country 
and our people stand before the world as the 
brightest types of inventive skill and educa- 
tional growth. But if we as a profession are 
the one exception to the rule of progression, 
then shut us out, build a wall around our 
pitiable brains, and let us vegetate, "unknown, 
unhonored, and unsung." Tear from our 
hearts and brains the names of those that 
have raised our profession to the zenith; cast 
out our heroes; wash from the slate the 
names of our MacDowells, Batteys, Simses; 



*Deciphererof Sir Francis Bacon's Cipher Stories. 



raze from our escutcheons the Hamiltons, 
Senns, Shurlys, and men of that ilk; send 
into oblivion the Mitchells, Elliots, Thomases, 
and the host of other American physicians 
famous in their day and age. If I write 
strongly upon this subject, it is because I 
think strongly. There is no wish upon my 
part to deny the great work accomplished by 
foreign physicians — far from it; let us give 
them all due credit for their discoveries in 
the realm of medicine and surgery, but not 
one iota more. 

That our editors do discriminate is easy of 
demonstration. I counted the articles, ex- 
cerpts, and reviews in a leading American 
journal for the first five months of 1894, and 
the following was the result: Germany was 
credited with 105, Belgium with 1, Russia 1, 
France 61, England and her provinces 37, 
Italy 2, South America 1, United States 61; 
total, 269. From European sources, 207; 
from the United States, 61; balance in favor 
of Europe, 146. 

A case or two showing the injustice done 
our physicians may not come amiss. An 
eminent laryngologist of Detroit published 
an article some time ago in an Eastern jour- 
nal, which was translated and republished in 
a Parisian journal, and in the meantime our 
erudite American editors passed the original 
by without notice. But, behold ' when re- 
translated from the French, our faddists 
scattered it broadcast east, west, north, and 
south. The writer first published the carbo- 
hydrate treatment for uric-acid diathesis, in 
the Detroit Clinic. One single American 
editor republished it and its forty-nine re- 
ported cases. Some two years later a Ger- 
man physician published as his own in a 
Berlin journal this same treatment, even to 
the exhibition of magnesia sulphate, but gave 
no credit to America or Americans; he knew 
us and our craze for foreign articles too well; 
and he was not disappointed, for his article

( )ne could go on citing case after case, ad

sources, yet each and every one primarily 
given to the profession by our own people. 
But. alas! until the seal of Germany, France 
or England has been affixed, our editors pass 
them by as unworthy of notice. The time, 
however, is approaching when the rank and file 
of American practitioners will marshal under 
the Monroe-doctrine banner, and force the 
medical journals of this great country to take 
the same stand for the profession as the pub- 
lic press takes in matters political. Woe to 
the statesman who recedes a step from the 
old doctrine; such a storm from editorial 
pens breaks o'er his head, that the in-rushing 
tidal wave of public opinion buries him deep 
in a political grave. All hail to the time 
when our medical journals will take the same 
stand; then, and not till then, will the fad- 
dism that to-day is rampant fall into oblivion; 
then will the Xestors of the medical profes- 
sion in these United States take the high 
position that belongs to them by right; then 
will the journal that first inaugurates this 
new order of fair play become preeminent, 
and its editor earn and enjoy the praise and 
honor of the whole profession. 

There is an easy and safe remedy for this 
growing evil, and it lies with the medical 
profession to employ it. Refuse to subscribe

LOCALIZED NEURITIS OF THE BRACHIAL 
PLEXUS. 

i:\ WILLI \M C. S . :.I&gt;. 

The following interesting case of neuritis 
of individual strands of the brachial plexus 
is worthy of careful consideration — fi; 
account of its extreme rarity; second, be- 
cause such are in many instances erroneous- 
ly diagnosed and consequently improperly 
treated; third, to direct attention to this form 
of neural disease and to warn against the 
assumption that all pain about the joints is 
of rheumatic or neuralgic character. 

John S , age 32, height five feet eight 

inches, weight 150 pounds, complexion dark, 
constitution strong, healthy, robust. Father 
and mother are living and healthy, aged 70 
and 68 years respectively. # Grandparents 
lived to old age. No history of cancer, 
syphilis, tuberculosis or insanity in near or 
distant relatives obtainable. Nothing of 
note transpired in his early life. Worked at 
various occupations until his twentieth year; 
then enlisted in the British Army and was 
sent to India, where he contracted gonorrhoea 
and syphilis, secondary symptoms appearing 
in due time. He was appointed instructor in 
the Army gymnasium, which offered him un- 
usual facilities for the acquirement of the 
alcohol habit, which he willingly accepted. 
Returning to England in 1889, he shipped in 
a steamer bound for Panama. Here he was 
taken with malarial fever — which has at ir- 
regular intervals afflicted him ever since. 
Besides malaria he has within the past three 
years been afflicted with rheumatism and has 
been unable to accomplish any work. 

He entered hospital January 16th, 1894, 
and was discharged as improved twice, but 
would soon return with jaundice, nausea, and 
muscular pains. Despite treatment the pa- 
tient did not gain flesh, anaemia increased, 
and he would often be compelled to remain 
in bed for several days with tinnitus aurium 
and headache. During such attacks he 
would vomit a greenish fluid. 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 






About January ist, 1895, he began to 
improve; general health was good and he 
suffered no pain. He was discharged from 
hospital February 15th, and returned Feb- 
ruary 23d. Complained of severe pain in 
right shoulder. Was put on rheumatic treat- 
ment, but no special notice was paid to this 
shoulder for some days. When this part was 
examined there was found much tenderness 
in region of joint. 

March 29th this man came under my per- 
sonal care, complaining of severe pain in the 
region of the shoulder-joint, just over the 
acromion, extending into the supra-clavicular 
space, then radiatipg toward the occiput; also 
pains about the scapula and upper part of the 
hunierus. On account of weakness and stiff- 
ness he was unable to use the right arm as 
dexterously as the left, although he is right- 
handed. Passive motion of the shoulder- 
joint did not cause pain. Pressure over 
the acromion process and over the supra- 
clavicular region (Erb's point) was extremely 
painful, while pressure through the shoulder- 
joint evoked hardly more than the normal 
sensitiveness. Disturbances of sensation, as 
to pressure, pain, heat, and cold, were en- 
tirely wanting. 

The wasting of the muscles about the right 
shoulder-joint was at once evident. The 
right shoulder had lost the characteristic 
roundness and fullness; it was angular and 
the acromion very prominent, due to the 
atrophy of the deltoid muscle. The right 
shoulder was from one to two inches lower 
than the left; the scapular muscles, supra- 
spinatus and infra-spinati, markedly atro- 
phied, the spine of the scapula being brought 
thereby into undue prominence. The tra- 
pezius and rhomboids, major and minor, 
and levator anguli scapulas, also participated 
in the wasting, as demonstrated by the droop- 
ing of the shoulder and inability to draw 
it backward and upward. The serratus 
magnus likewise was affected, as shown by 
the " angel's wing " appearance of the scapula 
when the arms were extended forward, the 
scapula, especially the posterior border, pro- 
jecting from the chest- wall. 

When the arms were extended, the right 
offered much less resistance to pressure than 
the left; when raised over the head the right 



arm was easily brought downward, while the 
left required much more force on the part of 
the examiner. 

The atrophied muscles were soft, flabby, 
and when brought into play non-resistant. 

Circumference of left arm at nine, six, and 
three inches respectively from the acromion, 
9/i, 9%, and 11 inches; right arm, 8 1 /,, 8%, 
and 10X inches. Distance from sternum to 
vertebral column three inches below the right 
acromion (passing over the affected joint mus- 
cles), 18 }£ inches; distance over the left 
shoulder, same measurement, 19^ inches. 
Distance over shoulder on a level with the 
lower border of the second rib, right side, 8 
inches; the same on left side, 8^ inches. 
Semi-circumference of chest three inches 
above nipple, right side 17^ inches, left side 
i8^§ inches. Muscle irritability over the af- 
fected muscles lost. An electrical examina- 
tion was not made. 

It will thus be seen that, according to 
measurements, active and passive motion, 
external appearance, and by palpation, the 
deltoid, trapezius, rhomboids, levator anguli 
scapulae, supra- and infra-spinatus, and ser- 
ratus magnus especially, were all affected by 
some lesion having the same symptomatic 
sequelae in common. Along with this condi- 
tion there were present subjective pain and 
pain on pressure over the nerve trunks, and 
absence of muscle reflexes or muscle irrita- 
bility. 

The muscles of the lower arm and hand on 
the right side were unaffected, thus proving 
conclusively that the brachial plexus in toto 
was not implicated, but only individual 
strands. The nerves supplying the affected 
muscles come from the fifth and sixth cervical 
nerves, which form the outer cord of the 
brachial plexus. 

The aetiology — whether the neuritis was 
the effect of a toxic agent, traumatism, or 
pressure of some inflammatory process— must 
be left unconjectured. Any one of the agen- 
cies which he has combated would t&gt;e suffi- 
cient to provoke a neuritic process; and to 
eliminate any one as the supposed cause 
would be open to question. 

The patient improved under treatment, but 
left the hospital before full recovery.

unless the headache be confined to a certain

ebral vomiting and vertigo are character- 
istic, the latter being more pronounced in 

bellar than in cerebral growth. — Fre- 
quency and severity of convulsions may give 
some clue to the progress of a tumor, indi- 
cating its site if they affect regularly the 
same group of muscles. Choked disk, mostly 

ble, denotes the presence of a growth 
and is often combined with optic neuritis; in 
the latter case the lesion is apt to be on the 
side where the least swelling occurs. Doctor 
Senn, citing five cases of cerebral tumors, 
remarks that in three neuritis was present, 
all of which were fatal. While this may 
have been coincidental, he holds that neu- 
ritis might arouse suspicion of serious com- 
plication (advanced stage?), and deems it 
preferable that the diagnosis be made before 
the onset. In rare instances we meet with 
monocular choked disk, indicating tumor in 
the opposite hemisphere. 

Paresis of single or more muscles suggests 
pressure, but may be the result of infiltration 
of pathogenic matter in nerve tissues. Of 
greatest importance is the presence of hemi- 
anopsia, pointing to a lesion of the cuneus 
on the same side. This eye symptom alone 
may lead to correct diagnosis of tumor. — 
Birdsall and Weir report a case where it was 
the only decisive symptom besides the minor 
ones of diplopia for distance, numbness of 
right leg, and staggering gait.* 

Doctor Ranney's test of hemianopsia rec- 
ommends itself: The patient presses one lid

Mental disturbances, hallucinations, delu- 
sions, word-deafness, [word-blindness, para- 
phasia, agraphia, in brief one or more con- 
ditions of sensory aphasia, may be found 
with tumor. If the growth invades s; 
centres, the cortical motion centres, or the 
nerves extending from them, the location 
can be reasonably well diagnosed; moreover, 
if several centres have been successively at- 
tacked, the lesion is traced by irritation and 
paralysis. Aphasia is a symptom of tumor 
in the third frontal convolution of either side, 
according to right- or left-handed habit. If 
blindness develops rapidly, leading to inter- 
nal hydrocephalus, accompanied by the usual 
pressure symptoms, the lesion is likely i 
pons or cerebellum. Coexistence of impair 
raent of sensation with hemiplegia, is con 
sidered by Ranney an almost positive diag 
nostic sign that the exciting cause is withi 
the substance of the brain and not upon 
surface. 

The anterior portion of the frontal lobes, 
the temporo-sphenoidal lobe (except part of 
left side), a great part of the parietal and 
occipital lobes, and to a limited extent the 
cerebellum, may be affected by a tumor of 
large size without any localizing symptoms 
whatever, as it does not interfere with the 
special senses and "only manifests itself by 
headache, vomiting, choked disk, and con- 
vulsions. If the tumor lies in the cortex, 
there may be tenderness on pressure over its 
seat, and in some instances a local rise of 
temperature; the absence of anaesthesia, and 
affection of motor centres in this part of the 
brain, are of great diagnostic value. In a 
single and small tumor the localizing symp- 
toms are confined to one centre, with ins 
nificant or no intracranial pressure. — If mul- 
tiple and far-apart centres are involved, and 
the pressure symptoms are very marked, it is 
either a multiple or an exceptionally large 
tumor. Displacement of the eyeball, which

occasionally occurs in a tumor of anterior 
fossa of the base of cranium, indicates pene- 
tration through the superior arch of the 
orbital cavity. 

Previous history of syphilitic or tubercular 
infection, or of traumatic injury, is valuable 
as to the nature of the growth. Tubercular 
tumor is apt to be multiple, and usually oc- 
curs before the twenty-fifth year; sarcoma 
and glioma are usually confined to mid- 
dle life and old age. — Parker states as a 
differential point between gummata and 
other tumors, that in the former no optic 
neuritis is observed; considering the fact 
(according to Allen Starr) that more than 
half of all tumors are tubercular, the import- 
ance of inquiry in this direction is obvious. 

Differential diagnosis between tumor and 
abscess is guided by the comparatively slower 
development of tumor — time varying from 
several months to two years. Again, there 
is subnormal and fluctuating temperature in 
abscess, while tumor seldom produces rise or 
fall. Absence of choked disk speaks for ab- 
scess. The greater percentage of cerebral 
abscesses is due to aural suppuration or to 
chronic inflammation of the ear where the 
mucous membrane is destroyed, the bone 
laid bare, perhaps carious, and filled with 
septic discharges of a pathogenic character. 
(Roehrer.) 

Barker classified the different pathological 
conditions which may be derived from pri- 
mary suppuration into: General septic men- 
ingitis ; plastic phlebitis of the sinuses ; 
pyaemia alone or connected with phlebitis ; 
abscess of cerebellum; and abscess of cere- 
brum. 

Aural disease at times produces an abscess 
within an inch of the inferior surface of the 
brain, the cortex remaining intact; but most 
abscesses are situated in the temporo-sphe- 
noidal lobe between two vertical lines, the 
anterior of which passes through the tragus 
and the posterior two inches back of it, press- 
ing on Broca's convolution, producing motor 
aphasia. Abscesses due to ear diseases are 
either encapsulated or diffuse, differing from 
other cerebral abscesses by being covered by 
a circle of an inch and a quarter above and 
behind the meatus, the " dangerous region." 
(Barker.) In diagnosis, consider sudden ces- 
sation of chronic ear discharge, nausea and 



vomiting, initial rise of temperature followed 
by subnormal fall yet always higher over the 
abscess, dull ache in temples, neck, and mas- 
toid region, frequent pulse (contrary to other 
brain abscesses, where it may be as low as 30 
to 40), foul tongue, and foetid breath; optic 
neuritis and choked disk may be present. 

In cerebral abscess, ptosis, anorexia, vom- 
iting, loss of control over bowels and bladder, 
convulsive epileptoid twitching, and paraly- 
sis, may be observed, the latter as localizing 
symptom. The headache may be over the 
lesion, but oftener first general and then 
frontal. If not coped with, the dullness 
gradually deepens into coma, and the temper- 
ature may rise preceding lethal termination. 

Von Bergmann's diagnostic advice demands 
consideration from an aetiological standpoint, 
as a primary or idiopathic brain abscess is 
unknown. — He distinguishes acute cortical 
abscess directly beneath the site of wound, 
resembling diffuse traumatic meningitis, and 
a later form occurring even months after and 
not in direct connection with the injury. 

In cerebellar abscess, muscular rigidity of 
the neck and occipital headache may be ob- 
served; vertigo and vomiting, unsteady gait 
and muscular incoordination indicate seat 
of lesion in the middle lobe. Pressure on the 
lower part of the Rolandic region is mani- 
fested by paresis or paralysis of the opposite 
side of the face, and subsequently arm and 
leg. If the latent part of frontal or occipital 
lobe (excepting cuneus) is affected, localizing 
symptoms are reduced or absent. Immobile 
pupil is important as to the side of the lesion. 

Cerebral abscess arising from ear disease 
differs in temperature from pyaemia (which is 
subject to acute fluctuations and at times 
rigor) and from meningitis (which induces 
high temperature, earlier dullness, coma and 
delirium, photophobia, contracted pupils, and 
rigid cervical muscles — it develops within 
three or four days, while the formation of an 
abscess occupies a week). 

The differential diagnosis between cerebral 
and cerebellar abscess is not clearly defined, 
but Barker finds the favored seat of the latter 
lesion at the outer and anterior part of the 
lateral lobe, bordering petrous bone, and 
marked by characteristic lowered tempera- 
ture in the evening and sluggish but perfect 
cerebration. Extra-dural abscesses are diag-

ture is associated, there is rarely an elevation, 
and the ridge margin is sharper and more 
irregular; a decisive diagnosis can be best 
reached by antiseptic raising of a horseshoe- 
ped flap, especially if the scalp is much 
en. 

In S4 ibscess, sclerosis, and even 

necrosis, may follow contusions. If they in- 
volve the brain they are considered concus- 
sions, or more properly lacerations of the 
brain — derived by direct or indirect force. 
Nausea, vomiting, giddiness and confusion 
succeed in slight cases, while more serious 
concussions are indicated by feeble, fluttering 
heart, cold clammy skin, sluggish drowsy 
cerebration, involuntary passing of faeces and 
urine, vertigo, and sometimes cerebral irrita- 
bility; coma, meningitis, or encephalitis may 
precede death. 

All signs of fractured base may be present 
with concussion, and again concussion can be 
connected with fracture as in the case re- 
ported by Barrow,* of compound comminuted 
depressed fracture of skull with laceration 
of brain, accompanied by opisthotonos, facial 
(and later general clonic) convulsions, left 
motor paralysis, twitching of left orbicularis 
oculi, drawing of left mouth-angle, retraction 
of head; neither headache nor discharges 
from nose or ear were present. Depressed 
fracture produces immediate symptoms; 
hemorrhage gradual. 

Fractures, single or multiple, may occur in 
any portion of the cranium, and likewise may 
extend from vault to base. Compound frac- 
tures are open to germ infection and result- 
ant septic meningitis. Direct violence affects 
the vault, indirect violence (as a fall) the

ed by percussion which produces a

pth, in case of depression of funnel 
shape, can be felt by touch. The rare case 
of rupture of the dura is revealed by I 
cape of cerebro spinal fluid and tense trans- 
lucent swelling. 

Compound fractures are detected by both 
sight and touch. Coagulated blood of a 
pericranious slit or oozing from Wormian 
bones is at times mistaken for a fracture, but 
the simple test of sponging suffices, as the 
dark blood line of linear fracture does not 
yield to washing; again, the saw-shape of 
suture assists discrimination. 

A blow struck above or in front of the left 
ear may shatter the inner table, manifested 
by intracranial irritation, inflammation, pos- 
sibly palsy of speech and right arm; hemi- 
plegia, aphasia, even temporary insanity,* 
may be symptoms of complicated fracture. 
In the opinion of Doctor Rey, a fracture can 
result in general paralysis, which in his ex- 
perience followed a badly united frontal 
bone. 

Depressed fractures date at times from 
operative child-delivery, causing ptosis, par- 
alysis, etc. 

Lesions of the base can affect one, two, or 
in very rare cases three, fossae, f and are most 
frequent in the middle and most dangerous 
in the posterior fossa. Canes, knives, um- 
brellas, etc., thrust in orbit, nose, or eyeball, 
often cause fracture of the base, proven by 
the escape of cerebro-spinal fluid or by long- 
continued bleeding from the ear with watery 
discharge, which is aggravated by violent 
respiration and change of the position of the 
head — bleeding from a wound without frac- 
ture being easily controlled. 

Compound fracture with unruptured tym- 
panum shows no symptom of discharge, 
though treacherous in its communication 
with the air through naso-pharynx and Eu- 
stachian tube. The orbit ought to be a

special object of examination, as the folds 
of the upper lids tend to hide the entrance 
point of injury. A fracture of the orbital 
plate, punctured or unpunctured, can be 
diagnosed by blood under the conjunctiva of 
eyeball and, somewhat later, of the lid. 

Ecchymosis of the mastoid region, spread- 
ing in crescent shape, is a localizing symptom 
of the lesion in posterior fossa. 

A notable rise of temperature announces 
the complication of suppuration or menin- 
gitis; if excessively high (io6°-io8°), of 
lethal laceration of the brain. The average 
temperature after a shock is subnormal, suc- 
ceeded by a rise to ioo°-ioi°, relapsing soon 
to normal or subnormal. 'Exploratory in- 
cisions are often made, and the escaping 
fluid in all cases examined. 

An important diagnostic point is mentioned 
by Wyman: the presence of "sense-interval" 
(intermitting stunned and conscious condi- 
tions) in fracture of the base. 

Wounds of the brain are produced by 
swords, knives, shots, etc., through channels 
before named, else open fontanelles of chil- 
dren and large parietal foramina of adults. 
Wounds of the head may be complicated by 
laceration of the brain, fragments of bone 
and hair, serious haemorrhage, simple, com- 
pound, punctured or unpunctured fractures. 
If a foreign body enter the latent region of 
brain, it may remain there for years with 
barely a symptom of trouble, while the pene- 
tration and presence of it in the speech centre 
would be followed by motor aphasia. 

Word-blindness and apraxia warn one to 
look for injury above and behind the ear; 
and palsy of face, arm, or leg, to search in the 
cortical centres. The symptom of hemian- 
opsia calls for rigid examination of cuneus. 
Wounds of the anterior portion of brain and 
skull offer more hope than those of any other 
cerebral region. 

The symptoms of gunshot wounds do not 
differ materially from others, but can be less 
exactly localized on account of their exten- 
sion, the small entrance point standing in no 
proportion to the injury of the brain and to 
the dimensions of the ball exit. 

Delvet and Dragon* divide suicidal shots 
into four series: Ball lodged in the substance 



of one brain hemisphere: Ball traversing both 
hemispheres and landing in opposite wall of 
the skull: Same conditions, but ball turning 
back and lodging in brain substance: Hall 
passing clear through. 

The second and third are most frequent, 
and the experimentors found the dura almost 
always torn at the point of reflection of the 
ball. 

A shot may but graze the outer table, 
merely Assuring it, or may communicate the 
shock to the inner table, producing fracture. 
All injuries are followed by headache, which, 
if severe and unchecked, develops into en- 
cephalitis, coma, and death. Of diagnostic 
value is the minute inquiry into circumstances 
and time of injury. 

If the cicatrix of any wound is tender, 
producing radiating pain, and the pressure 
becomes aggravated, it may cause months or 
years later epileptoid fits which time and 
habit confirm into epilepsy. Bergmann dis- 
tinguishes: Reflex-epilepsy, caused by affec- 
tion of peripheral nerves, only indirectly 
affecting the cortex: Epilepsy resulting from 
lesion of cortex itself. 

Alteration in the texture of cortical tissues 
from fatty or other degenerative changes 
may produce epilepsy. If the lesion lies 
over motor centres, and the fits are confined 
to the connecting muscles, their close mutual 
relation is obvious.

CASE OF CONGENITAL CYANOSIS. 

BY H. W. MCLAUTHLIN, M.D. 

Joseph H , aged 5^ years, born in the 

United States, is a twin child whose mate 
died a few minutes after birth. Nothing of 
importance in the family history; parents liv- 
ing and in good health; was always puny 
and delicate, and from the first it was noticed 
his nails were curved and -blue. When five 
months old had entero-colitis, and during 
his first and second summers was subject to 
attacks of diarrhoea; when four years old, 
had whooping-cough severely. Never had 
rheumatism. Mother thinks he began to 
talk and that he cut his teeth at the usual 
time, but he did not walk until two-and-a- 
half years old, and exhibited weakness of the 
ankles for a considerable time thereafter. 

General cyanosis was first noticed when

violently: at the time when these n 
made he had never lost consciousness no: 
had convulsions or twitching. Each attack 
from five to fifteen minutes, and was 
apt to recur after an interval of several min- 
it the conclusion of which he became 
very drowsy, falling asleep, and awaking 
in his normal condition except, perhaps, for 
slight headache, nausea, or both. He com- 
plained greatly of being cold, and the feet and 
hands were always chilly to touch. Appetite 
generally poor, and bowels always consti- 
pated. He plays but little, always guarded-* 
|y, and has dyspnoea on the slightest exer- 
tion. Always had some cough, and takes 
cold easily. Is drowsy and sleepy much of 
the time, and especially after a meal. Easily 
irritated and often peevish. Seems bright 
and learns quite readily. Skin always dry. 
Has never had oedema or dropsy. Urine 
shows nothing abnormal. 

Physical examination showed him to be 
considerably emaciated: face of a bluish 
color, as well as the hands and feet; lips, 
tongue, interior of mouth, ends of fingers 
and toes of a bluish-black color; nails 
clubbed and curved; veins on chest promi- 
nent; temperature normal; pulse 104, small, 
but equal in both wrists. Heart dullness ex- 
tending one inch to the right of the sternum, 
the apex beat being seen, felt and heard 
most distinctly in the sixth intercostal space, 
about two inches to the right of the nip- 
ple and one-half inch to the left of the 
sternum. No murmur at the apex, but a 
systolic sound heard clearly over the base, 
loudest in the second and third intercostal 
spaces, apparently equal in intensity on both 
sides of the sternum, and faintly heard in the 
neck and near the lower angle of the left 
scapula; both aortic and pulmonary second 
sounds apparently exaggerated. Examina- 
tion of the other organs gave negative re- 
sults, except a slight enlargement of liver.

a mild attack. While walking slowly on the I

almost black, the heart beat violently but 
irregularly, and he would have fallen II 
supported. The breathing was panting. I &gt;n 
taken tO a convenient place and al- 
lowed to lie down, drowsiness supervened; 
he lay quietly for some minutes, the blueness 
gradually lessening. Pain was slight in this 
attack, but his mother stated that shortly I 
after, on again attempting to walk, the at- { 
tack recurred and more severely. 

The patient has since had one attack of 
convulsions, which occurred about June 1st. 
For a few days previous he had been more I 
quiet and had been more troubled by dysp- 
noea and cyanosis. The convulsions were 
general, and he was unconscious for some 1 
minutes. When seen a few hours later, he I 
seemed perfectly natural. 

Although the diagnosis of congenital heart 
lesions may be easy, in a given case it is 
generally difficult and often impossible to 
determine the exact lesion. The condition 
is due to arrested development, to endocar- \ 
ditis in fcetal life, or to both. The arrest in 
development may take place at any stage in 
the growth of the heart. If, however, the 
heart remains in a very rudimentary state, t 
the child can survive only a few hours, or, 
at the most, a few days. If the arrest in de- 
velopment occurs at a later period, as is 
generally the case, the normal mechanism 
may be more nearly complete; the cardiac f 
partitions may be deficient, or the large ves- 
sels misplaced or even transposed. — Thus the 
aorta may be displaced to the right, arising 
in part or wholly from the right ventricle, 
while the pulmonary artery may arise from 
the left ventricle. Eustace Smith says:* 

When the aorta is merely displaced to the right, 
without malposition of the pulmonary artery, we 
usually find some obstruction to the passage of J 
blood from the right ventricle through the latter. 
The artery is too small, or its valves are incom- 
plete, or the blood is prevented from passing freely 
into it by some constriction of the ventricle near its 
outlet, or its channel may be entirely obliterated, 
in all of which cases the foramen ovale must re- 
main open or the circulation could no longer be

carried on. The blood, being unable to find its 
way in sufficient quantities to the left side of the 
heart through the lungs, continues to follow its 
original course through the opening in the auricu- 
lar septum, and the foramen ovale remains open. 
If, however, the aorta arises sufficiently to the right 
to allow the escape of blood through it from the 
right ventricle, the foramen ovale and ductus arteri- 
osus may cease to be pervious. 

Constriction in the pulmonary artery, with defi- 
ciency in the septum of the ventricles, so that the 
aorta communicates with the right ventricular 
cavity, is the commonest form of congenital mal- 
formation of the heart. Sometimes the descending 
aorta arises from the pulmonary artery, being ap- 
parently a continuation of the ductus arteriosus. 
In this case a small ascending aorta arises from 
the left ventricle to supply the head and neck by 
the usual vessels. 

On the other hand, the defect may consist, 
not in the patent fcetal openings after birth, 
but in too early closing of same before birth; 
and should such be the case with the foramen 
ovale, all the blood must pass through the 
pulmonary artery and the ductus arteriosus, 
whereby the right heart becomes immensely 
hypertrophied, the left side being unnaturally 
small. Or if the ductus arteriosus closes too 
early, the aorta may arise from the right ven- 
tricle and give branches to the lungs, the 
pulmonary artery remaining rudimentary. 
The congenital lesion may also be a narrow- 
ing of the openings of the large vessels or 
defective valves arising from either malfor- 
mation or fcetal endocarditis, which almost 
always attacks the right heart, this being 
more active than the left in fcetal life. In all 
cases the heart, especially the right side, is 
greatly hypertrophied. 

In attempting to diagnose the exact condi- 
tion which exists in the heart in these cases, 
one is at once placed at a formidable disad- 
vantage in that, instead of having, as usual, 
a heart of which he knows the structure, the 
number and situation of its openings, and the 
number and working of its valves, and in- 
stead of having a normally directed blood- 
current — in which conditions the physical 
signs have, consequently, a definite meaning 
— he has to deal with an organ in which the 
number and position of the openings and the 
direction of the blood-current are unknown 
except by conjecture. Certain rules, how- 
ever, may be borne in mind: In the first 
place, some forms of congenital defect are 



quickly fatal; an infant whose heart consists 
of only two cavities will probably not live a 
month. Transposition of the aorta and pul- 
monary artery also brings death within two 
or three years, and generally within one year; 
and the same is true where the aorta arises 
from the pulmonary artery.— If the child has 
survived three years, the above conditions 
can be excluded. 

Some contraction at the orifice of the pul- 
monary artery is the most common lesion, 
probably associated with patency of the fora- 
men ovale and, perhaps, with a connection 
between the aorta and right ventricle and 
patency of the ductus arteriosus. The phys- 
ical signs of this condition are a systolic 
murmur heard over the base of the heart, 
especially over the pulmonary valves, not 
transmitted into the large vessels, associated 
with enlargement of the right side. The fact 
that in the case reported the murmur was ap- 
parently transmitted to the large vessels, 
seems to indicate there might have been 
other pathological conditions present than 
those just noted. 

An open foramen ovale is seldom a solitary 
abnormality, although congenital cyanosis 
without a murmur, or with a very faint one, 
and no enlargement of the right heart in a 
child at least three years old, points to such a 
condition. Hochsinger says: 

The entire absence of murmurs at the apex, with 
their evident presence in the region of the auricles 
and over the pulmonary orifice, is always an im- 
portant element in differential diagnosis, and points 
rather to septum defect or pulmonary stenosis than 
to endocarditis. 

Ostler adds that stenosis, obliteration, and 
atresia at the pulmonary orifice, or stenosis 
of that portion of the right ventricle adjoin- 
ing it, with or without imperfection of the 
ventricular septum, patency of the foramen 
ovale and persistence of the ductus arteriosus, 
constitute the most important group of all 
congenital heart affections; and 119 of the 
181 cases of congenital heart anomalies col- 
lected by Peacock came under this class, as 
did also eighty-six per cent, of those cases 
living beyond the twelfth year. DaCosta 
corroborates. But all authors seem to agree 
that an exact diagnosis cannot be made, and 
that other conditions than those diagnosed 
are liable to be present.

Hunter attributes it to inten.se mixing of the 
with the un oxygenized blood, a view 
that has been proved incorrect. In the first

. the decree of cyanosis is 
not dependent on the amount of venous 
blood contaminating the arterial current. 
gagni and Peacock were the first to show 
the true cause to be intense general conges- 
tion, due to stasis of blood in capillaries 
dilated by # long-standing congestion, aided 
by imperfect aeration of the whole mass of 
blood. 

The prognosis of these cases depends 
largely, of course, on the degree of obstruc- 
tion to the circulation, but is generally very 
unfavorable. One-half the cases die in the 
and only about one-third survive the 
second year. On account of the constant 
and intense venous congestion, the functions 
of all the organs are imperfectly performed; 
the child is poorly nourished, thin in flesh, 
and constantly liable to catarrhal troubles of 
the respiratory and digestive tract. The es- 
tablishment of respiration at birth, the erup- 
tion of the teeth, weaning, and the diseases 
peculiar, to childhood, are always, at best, 
trying periods, while in a child with a con- 
genital heart malady they are periods of 
great danger. And yet, occasionally, these 
cases do live to adult life. Cyanotic children 
often die in convulsions or from heart failure 
during attacks of syncope. Pneumonia and 
tuberculosis are rather frequent complica- 
tions, and DaCosta calls attention to abscess 
of the brain occurring in cases of malformed 
heart without apparent cause. Certain symp- 
toms are especially unfavorable, such as fre- 
quent attacks of syncope, great drowsiness, 
convulsions, or other signs of brain irritation, 
as well as symptoms of renal disease.

temperature and inclement weather, while at 
the same time the advantage of fresh air, in 
ip the general health, is to be borne 
in mind. Again, on account of the mal- 
nutrition, care as to diet is essential, that the 
patient may, on the one hand, be as well sus- 
tained as possible, and, on the other, that he 
may be guarded from the ills arising from 
his natural tendency to gastro-intestinal 
catarrh. An occasional mercurial, to relieve, 
to some extent, the overloaded portal sys- 
tem, is judicious. Freedom from excitement 
and over-exertion, and speedy and careful 
attention to all ailments, however slight, are I 
important. Owing to the natural dryness of I 
the skin, a bath should be given at least once j 
daily, followed by brisk friction. For violent j 
attacks of palpitation, digitalis maybe guard- 
edly tried, and for the attacks of syncope and 
dyspnoea stimulants and ammonia are in- 
dicated. 

The urine should be watched in order that 
the appearance of albumen, or other evidence 
of renal disturbance, may suggest prompt 
treatment.

TRAUMATIC INJURIES OF THE EYESJ 
BY H. MOULTON, M.D. 

In these days of preventive medicine, dis- 
eases of the eye have received due attention, 
but little is heard of prevention of injuries, 
which, in reality, can often be more easily 
guarded against than the maladies per se } for 
they have more tangible causes and can be 
more readily foreseen. For instance, a man 
entering upon a certain occupation knows 
beforehand that all who engage in that pur- 
suit are liable to receive injuries to their eyes, 
(irinders of tools, for example, are liable to 
suffer frequent accidents from the impact of

flying particles from the wheels; these par- 
ticles, in dry grinding especially, are hot, and 
do more or less damage to sight, according 
to the portion of cornea struck and the depth 
to which they penetrate. All these injuries 
can easily be prevented by the simple plan 
of wearing plain protective spectacles of 
glass or mica. So too of many other occupa- 
tions. 

Mr. Simeon Snell, of Sheffield, England, 
in 1894 read a paper before the British 
Medical Association, in which he dealt very 
fully with the relative liability of certain 
trades to produce eye-injuries. With us, 
in the Indian Territory, many of these 
causes are yet of no concern — we see noth- 
ing of injuries arising from exposure of 
the eyes to the intense glare of electrical 
welding, where the chemical rays set up 
a severe inflammation of the conjunctiva 
with swelling of the lids and involvement of 
the cornea. But there are two occupations, 
aj least, which concern us and are among the 
most fruitful sources of eye-injury. One is 
that of grinding, or " saw-gumming," which 
is connected with every saw- mill in the Ter- 
ritory; the other is coal-mining; and we can 
all testify to many an injury derived from 
one or the other of these sources. The col- 
liers, perhaps, suffer less frequently than the 
mill-hands, but the injury is apt to be more 
serious; the particle of steel from the pick or 
drill, or the bit of coal, is larger, flies with 
more force, and more often penetrates the 
tunics of the eye; as a matter of fact, the 
particles from the emery wheel seldom per- 
forate. Snell, corroborating Fuchs, declares 
the wearing of protective glasses among 
such workmen should be made compulsory; 
and Magnus would prohibit the employment 
of one-eyed men in occupations dangerous to 
eyesight. The great obstacle in the way of 
glasses is the objection of the men them- 
selves; and though some of the objections 
are valid, the obvious advantages are so 
great and the experience of those who have 
tried them is so favorable that I think it 
behooves the medical profession to bring 
the facts more critically to the attention of 
both patients and the general public. 

Many of the more serious accidents, how- 
ever, occur without reference to occupation 
— such, for instance, as the wounds inflicted 



by scissors in the hand of the child, by the 
stick of kindling-wood under the axe of the 
careless man, or by the stray bird-shot from 
the muzzle of a companion's gun. Against 
these we can suggest no definite precautions; 
and yet, in England, I am told, some sports- 
men, when shooting, habitually wear heavy 
protectives of crystal one-quarter of an inch 
in thickness, set in stout steel frames, fitting 
closely to the margins of the orbit, and that 
are said to be absolutely shot-proof. This 
•seems to speak better for the discretion of 
John Bull than for his marksmanship. 

It is an error to exhibit carelessness re- 
garding the lighter injuries; there is no eye- 
wound so slight that it may not result 
seriously! To illustrate: August 3d, 1893, 
a grinder of tools in one of the furniture 
factories of Fort Smith received simultane- 
ously in both eyes many fine particles from 
his wheel. They apparently did but little 
damage to the cornea, none penetrating be- 
yond the superficial layer; yet, two days later, 
a double iritis developed, which ran a severe 
course, fortunately terminating in recovery. 
The iritis was clearly induced by the trauma- 
tism, there being no other cause to account 
for it. 

When the grave responsibility of deciding 
what to do with an eye which has recently 
suffered a perforating injury confronts one, 
he is apt to be confused by the apparently 
contradictory testimony that enters into the 
clinical histories of other and similar cases. 
Eyes considered convalescent and safe have 
at last been the cause of sympathetic blind- 
ness in the fellow optics. So, too, many an 
experienced ophthalmic surgeon has advised 
enucleation, which has been declined, and 
the injured eye remained harmless for a life- 
time. Experience is a great teacher, but has 
not yet taught everything. Of course, where 
sight is destroyed and the mutilation is 
great, or where the wound is in the ciliary 
region, with grave complications, or when a 
large foreign body cannot be extracted, de- 
cision is usually easy. In most other cases, 
and sometimes even in these, there is a grow- 
ing tendency to ask the question: "Cannot 
the eye be saved, if not with sight, at least 
with a good appearance ?" 

Since the general acceptance of the theory

St difficult, often, is the question whether

most important in that the body is liable to 
carry with it the infection, thus accounting 
for the fact that most of such cases, undis- 
turbed, lead to sympathetic trouble. Some- 
thing may depend, also, on the character of 
the foreign body: Glass is apt to be aseptic, 
while iron is not: Fuchs speaks of the dan- 
gerous nature of copper and brass; but at 
the Eighth International Ophthalmological 
Congress, such eminent authorities as Leber, 
Knapp, Xoyes, Roosa, Kipp and Meyer de- 
clared foreign bodies of brass and copper 
are apt to be aseptic, and hence, if small, 
likely to be tolerated. 

The difficulty of determining the presence 
of a foreign body is enhanced by its peculiar 
location, by blood in one of the chambers, 
by cataract, etc. A gentleman, on turning a 
corner, into the face of a wind which was 
blowing with almost the force of a hurri- 
cane, was forcibly struck in the right eye 
by a small object. The eye felt as though 
it had sand in it for a day or two, and 
then was apparently all right for a week or 
more. Suddenly it began to inflame and 
become sensitive to light. When I saw the 
case, seventeen days after the injury, I 
found iritis, and over the upper temporal 
quadrant of the periphery of the iris a de- 
posit of lymph, millet-seed in size, and ap- 
parently enclosing a small foreign body as of 
sand or glass. There was no mark on the 
cornea to indicate its point of entrance, which 
I supposed to be in the limbus and thus in- 
visible. Atropine was instilled, and I ex- 
pected, as soon as the inflammation should 
subside, to perform iridectomy and extract 
the foreign body with the piece of iris re- 



\ much to my surprise, both the 
&lt;&gt;f lymph and the supposed foreign 
body irere quickly absorbed. After con- 
tinuing the atropine for three weeks the 
patient was considered well. 

however, a re] . i arred. This 

time the case was under the care of an able 
oculist in a distant city, who found a flake of 
lymph on the base of the iris at its inferior 
nasal quadrant. From the history, and not 
knowing the location of the previous lesion, 
he supposed there was a foreign body, prob- 
&gt;t .^lass, imbedded in the iris at the seat 
of the nodule. He, too, expected to operate 
after the subsidence of inflammation, and was 
disappointed in the same way as myself. 
The case afterwards recovered permanently 
under anti-syphilitic treatment. The ap- 
pearances, without a coincident and mis- 
leading history, would have led to a correct 
diagnosis in the first place. 

As a general rule, an eye containing a for- 
eign body that cannot be extracted by tie 
magnet or other means must be sacrificed. 
While a small body sometimes remains in the 
background of the eye harmless for life, and 
sometimes justifies conservatism, yet Knapp, 
in his Archives,* after presenting a series of 
cases, says: "These show again that foreign 
bodies in the background of the eye, though 
apparently tolerated, can never be treated." 

To accomplish the prevention of infection 
of the injured eye, the wound is thoroughly 
cleansed, all possible foreign bodies being 
removed; then antiseptic treatment is ap 
plied, and the rent closed with sutures i 
necessary and practicable. Observe at the 
same time the rules of treatment demanded 
by a wounded lens, prolapsed iris, etc., if any 
of these conditions are present. Doctor P. 
D. Keyser, of Philadelphia,! reports two 
cases of injury to the ciliary body treated in 
this way, and my own experiences in this 
direction have also been most favorabl&lt; 
it is said that sympathetic trouble never de- 
velops in less than two weeks from the time 
of injury, there is ample time in which to 
make the best of conservatism. The rational 
method will often, when intelligently applied, 
save eyes which would otherwise be lost.

THE MEDICAL AGE. 



493 



Abadie and Darier, of Paris, who are lead- 
ers in sub-conjunctival therapeutics, advocate 
the doctrine that sub-conjunctival injections 
of corrosive sublimate will prevent and cure 
(among other things) certain infectious pro- 
cesses within the eyeball, resulting from per- 
forating wounds. If thus the infection of 
the first eye can be prevented or cured, of 
course, on the basis of this theory, no infec- 
tion can be transmitted to the fellow, and 
sympathetic ophthalmia will be prevented. 
Some apparently remarkable cures have been 
reported, yet numerous failures warn that the 
method cannot always be depended upon; it 
has not been much used in the United States. 
At the recent Congress at Edinburgh the 
subject was reopened by Darier; and while 
he, Deutchman and Dupour strongly advo- 
cated the injections, Bach and Guttman as 
strongly condemned them. Abadie recom- 
mends the injections for a time, when, if un- 
successful, he would proceed to enucleate. 
This would seem to be justifiable to a degree 
perhaps, provided the practitioner always 
keeps within the golden time limits of safety. 
De Wecker and others, in accordance with 
the theory that the infectious material finds 
its sole path of transmission to the other eye 
in the optic nerve, seek to obliterate this 
path by resection of this nerve. With this 
operation has been waged what is termed 

a campaign against the abuse of enuclea- 
tion;" but numerous failures under the most 
favorable circumstances have been reported 
by Rohnur, Marschall, Krones, Schweiger, and 
others.* There certainly must be some other 
path of transmission than along the optic 
nerve; at all events there is a possibility of 
failure in resection, and if successful the 
recovery is tedious and painful. To offset 
these objections, there is only the cosmetic 
argument left, whereas on the side of the 
radical operation there is the prospect of an 
almost certain success, quick recovery, and a 
permanent removal at once and forever of 
the source of infection. In this light, who 
would not prefer enucleation ? 

At present one feels safe in rejecting resec- 
tion as a substitute for enucleation, if the 
object is the prophylaxis of sympathetic 



ophthalmia. Of most value is the antiseptic 
method, supplemented by the electro-cautery 
to the wound if need be. Next in value will 
perhaps be proven to be the sublimate injec- 
tions. 

All patients that are treated conservatively 
must be warned that they are forever in 
danger, especially if they have foreign bodies 
in their eyes. It may be possible in future to 
reduce the number of enucleations, but if 
practitioners wish to secure sleep at night 
they will in many cases continue to remove 
injured eyes for a long time to come.

SOME SUGGESTIONS REGARDING RESPI = 
RATION. 

BY W. B. RUSSELL, M.D. 

According to Dunglison, this is a function 
the object of which is to place materials — 
the mixture of venous blood with lymph and 
chyle — already in the circulation in contact 
with atmospheric air, in order that the vivi- 
fying qualities peculiar to arterial blood may 
be acquired. The organs for executing this 
function are, in mammals, birds, and reptiles, 
the lungs. 

In man, respiration consists of mechanical 
and chemical phenomena: The mechanical 
are inspiration and expiration; the chemical, 
the formation of a certain quantity of car- 
bonic acid, the absorption of a quantity of 
oxygen, and the disengagement of a quantity 
of water in state of vapor. 

In healthy animals, respiration is easy, 
full, gentle, regular, and without noise; in 
man at the rate of about thirty-five per 
minute in the first year of life, twenty-five 
during the second year, twenty at puberty, 
and eighteen in the adult. 

The air of respiration has been divided 
into: First, the residual, or that which cannot 
be expelled from the lungs, but remains after 
a full and forcible expiration — estimated at 
120 cubic inches: Second, the supplementary 
or reserve air, that can be expelled by forci- 
ble expiration— say 130 cubic inches: Third, 
the tidal or breathing air — about 26 cubic 
inches: Fourth, the complemental air — that 
which can be inhaled after an ordinary inspi- 
ration — which amounts to 100 cubic inches. 






THE MEDICAL AGE. 



This gi i air 

ordinary inspi- 
n a medium nan, We have 

likewise nor: ent respira- 

I ration, impaired respira- 
tion, irregular respiration, oppressed respira- 
tion, ration, regarding which 
special remarks are required. 

[ration is one of the most, if 
not the most, vital of the functions. Life 
lid be impossible without air that contains 
gen in sufficient quantities to properly oxy- 
genate the blood and complete the chemical 
change necessary to supply every organ and 
part of the economy with the elements of 
nutrition, and in a form to be easily assimi- 
lated and renew broken-down and waste 
tissue or cells and keep up the standard of 
waste and repair. If this respiration is not 
properly performed, one or more or all of the 
several functions of the system are placed at 
a disadvantage, and as a result we have vari- 
ous forms of disease. 

And yet respiration is not wholly of the 
lungs, neither is all the oxygen employed in 
the chemical changes of the economy ab- 
sorbed through these organs. The skin and 
stomach are two vital assistants that deserve 
attention. It is well known that the destroy- 
ing of a certain amount of cuticle — the exact 
amount is somewhat of a moot question— by 
burns or other means, or even closing the 
pores and emunctories by paint or varnish, is 
to entail certain death; also it is essential 
that a constant supply of water be had by 
way of the stomach in order to keep up the 
seventy per cent, which the economy requires 
as a standard. 

Personally I consider deficient respiration 
the corner-stone, so to speak, of a large num- 
ber of maladies, and the function that in a 
vast percentage of cases requires first atten- 
tion; notably many of the chronic cases and 
those of so-called debility or neurasthenia are 
of this class. When a patient, male or female, 
from fifteen to twenty-five years old, regard- 
less of employment, has "nothing in particu- 
lar the matter," but complains of a tired, 
languid feeling, with poor appetite and con- 
stipated bowels — or perhaps irregular diar- 
rhoea; presents either scanty and high- 
colored, or copious and very light-colored, 
urine, with low or high specific gravity; is 



B, or perhaps flushed, red-faced and full- 
blooded, thin and anemic, or corpulent and 
bloated; sic ly and requires an hour 

or two in the morning to get into work: 
condition, and further pn isily 

pressed pulse and is "just good for noth- 
ing.'"- -then I look especially to the respira- 
tion, and likewise inquire carefully as 
habits of life outside of busim 

This class of patients pass from the hands 
of one physician to another, perhaps with, 
many different phases of diagnosis as there 
are prescribers, but do not get any better. 
Here, oftentimes, defective respiration pure 
and simple is the fault, and nothing more. 
The respiratory murmur is short and weak, 
and the amount of air inspired, even if forced, 
would not amount to more than ten cubic 
inches, and gives the "impression of being 
about one inch long;" if the patient has been 
obliged to ascend a flight of stairs and is ex- 
amined immediately, the respiration is more- 
over labored, and an even smaller amount of 
air enters the lungs, while the pulse is rapid 
but without force, and the heart weak as to 
action though normal as to sound. The tongue 
may tremble when extended, and be coated. 
Here the first essential is to teach the 
individual how to breathe. I immediately 
direct him or her to take three steps of 
twenty-four inches each on inspiration, and 
three more on expiration, for from ten to 
thirty minutes, three or four times a day; 
this, if persisted in for a few days, will usually 
work wonders. Now I increase the number 
of steps to six, and order the patient to bathe 
every evening in salt water, making the bath 
sufficiently strong with the Turk's Island 
product to equal in specific gravity sea water. 
This bath should be had every night on retir- 
ing, and be followed by a thorough rubbing 
of the back, arms, chest, and legs, with a 
coarse linen towel which has been previously 
dipped in a saturated solution of salt and 
water and made dry without wringing. Like- 
wise give from three to four quarts of pure 
spring water every day until the secretion of 
the kidneys is normal both as to color and 
specific gravity. In one week the patient 
will be better in everyway, and the insomnia, 
headache, constipation, palpitation and other 
ills relieved.

resort to drugs is often a material aid and 
more effective than prayers and the Bible. 
It is often advisable that the nervous system 
be stimulated, especially the sympathetic. 
The remedies I employ in order of value are: 
Marching and breathing exercise; salt bath 
and salt towel; plenty of cold water inter- 
nally, and a cup of hot water before meals; 
belladonna, gelsemium, cactus, strophanthus, 
convallaria, digitalis, for the circulation; salts 
of soda or potassium, phosphoric acid, nitro- 
muriatic acid, phosphate of soda and lime, 
ignatia, nux vomica, chloride of gold and 
sodium, etc., as tonics. Alcoholic stimulants 
are better avoided, and even tea and coffee 
should be employed very moderately. The 
diet should be liberal and highly nutritious — 
beef (chopped or scraped), mutton, chicken, 
game, butter, eggs (raw, soft-boiled, poached, 
and scrambled); any quantity of bread and 
farinaceous articles if there is no special 
contra-indication in the way of indigestion; 
all kinds of ripe and well cooked vegetables, 
such as potatoes, spinach, young peas, rice; 
egg and milk puddings and ripe fruit for 
dessert; pure water, warm fresh milk, cream, 
as beverages. Pork, veal, salt meats — ham 
excepted, — hashes, stews, cooked oysters, 
pickles and spices, pastry and preserves, 
thick gravies, and all made dishes, are better 
avoided. 

Case. — Mr. B , aged 34, came under 

my care in May, 1887, "nearly dead," as he 
said, with consumption. Percussion and 
auscultation certainly revealed all the evi- 
dences of phthisis, which were supplemented 
moreover by frequent attacks of haemorrhage. 
I ordered him stillingia liniment, and like- 
wise gave a small bottle of ergot for internal 
administration. Then started him to breath- 
ing, to taking salt baths with the towel treat- 
ment mornings, and spring water. I took 
him to New Hampshire for two weeks in 
August, and kept him constantly out of doors 
climbing hills. He gained from the very 
first, and is now selling teas and coffees on the 
road, apparently in the very best of health. 

I could cite numerous cases like the fore- 
going that have improved from the outset, in 
many of which there were even complications 
and serious structural changes. These pa- 
tients recover under the arousing of will 
force and making extraordinary efforts to 
pass a large amount of air through the lungs. 



As before remarked, I often find it conven- 
ient to give some small doses of medicine for 
the mental effect if nothing else, and such 
can often be utilized in correcting structural 
changes. I also insist upon a generous diet. 
As a whole, I am well satisfied with the re- 
sults. 

I do not wish it understood, however, that 
I am possessed of a belief that drug remedies 
are not of value — the contrary is very often 
the case, and they may afford most timely 
and able assistance. But I do wish to em- 
phasize the fact that sufficient attention is 
not paid to the gymnastics (so to speak) of 
the lungs, i.e., teaching the patient to breathe 
naturally and normally. I cannot recall hav- 
ing ever seen any literature calling attention 
to this vital question.* One very often meets 
patients who are not strong, who are not 
really ill but debilitated — patients one of 
whose lungs on percussion exhibits a sound 
from a quarter to a full note higher or lower 
on the musical scale than its fellow; again, 
one side will vary in the height of key while 
resonance will vary in the same location; 
and yet there are no rales either mucous or 
crepitant — only general debility. Such a 
condition is often diagnosed incipient phthisis, 
yet the whole trouble may arise from defi- 
cient respiration. The lungs or a portion 
thereof lie dormant with no seated trouble, 
but in a condition exceedingly susceptible to 
disease processes. In the majority of in- 
stances the patient will be easily relieved by 
change of climate or following the foregoing 
instructions. — The climate change, however, 
is only beneficial in the degree that it en- 
forces lung gymnastics, for when one goes 
to a mountain or seashore resort he falls into 
the prevailing fashion which compels every 
one to keep out of doors, to take long walks 
and drives, climb hills, and go in bathing — 
in fact, the mind is kept busy and the body 
active. The result is fuller respiration, which 
in turn brings increased thirst; an improve- 
ment in appetite follows, and thus general 
activity of the economy soon secures a new 
lease of life.

Editorial. 



EPISODIC MEDICINE. 

Medicine is nothing if not episodic. Its 
history through more than thirty centuries 
proves this. Every few years a new idea or 
new principle is enunciated that succeeds for 
a time in dominating, perhaps to the exclu- 
sion of everything else, medical practice, 
possibly with some benefit, but often with 
material detriment to both practitioners and 
patrons. 

It is within the memory of many living 
when most heroic venesection was considered 
a sine qua non in the treatment of each and 
every malady regardless of character or 
cause; when a case of lancets and a roll of 
bandage constituted the physician's passport 
to success; but like many another "fad," 
blood-letting was so completely overdone as 
to be practically annihilated in the rebound 
from this extreme. Then came starvation 
diet! "Live on a sixpence a day and earn 
it" was the watchword whereby all inflam- 
matory processes were to be reduced and 
the seeds of disease starved out. With the 
reaction, which was only as yesterday, it was 
deemed essential to stuff the patient to re- 
pletion with stimulants and nourishment. 
Finally came a revamping of part of the old 
humoral doctrine, disguised under the title 
of Microbic Pathology, which has not only 
run riot, but led every tyro upon whose 
sheepskin the dust has not had time to accu- 
mulate, to consider it his duty to speedily 
discover a bacillus; just now the microscope 
and culture-tube are in the ascendant, while 
the principles upon which the medical art is

and we have not only a plethora of new dis- 
\treines of absurdity, but

- danger* tally 

so in medicine. If modern practice is right, 
that of our forefathers during three thousand 
must bave been erroneous — deadly 
wrong, in fact — and we must be greatly wiser 
than our fathers and entitled to the profound 
gratitude of the human race for our su; 
knowledge and skill. But, unfortunate 
this nineteenth century the question is not as 
to the truth of an assertion, but whether it ema- 
nates from a recognized source of authority 
— and so every possible effort is put forth to 
become an "authority." It must also be 
recognized that the influence of so-called " au- 
thority" annually slays its millions of human 
beings; its pernicious effect upon human life 
in its individual and collective relations is 
felt in every clime. Yet, does anyone really 
believe that we are so entirely unlike our 
fathers and grandfathers as to require dia- 
metrically opposite treatment to that which 
served their purpose ? Surely the whole race 
cannot change in this essential particular 
every decade or so; and as regards a large 
number of diseases it is notorious the per- 
centage of fatalities has not lessened, but 
with some, on the contrary — pneumonia, for 
instance — has rather increased. Is it rational 
to suppose that seven radical changes have 
taken place in the economy of the entire 
human race from 1S00 to 1S95 ? If not, 
then why such wondrous vacillation both in 
therapeutics and pathology 5 And now ap- 
parently we are upon the verge of another 
change that perhaps may result beneficially. 

The future fad promises to be hajmoscopy, 
which inclines to regard the circulation as the 
source of disease and the medium through 
which it is to be arrested or eradicated. This, 
to be sure, will be a revamping of another 
branch of the old humoral pathology, and 
somewhat on the lines laid down by Sauls- 
bury in the fifties, but it has the advantage 
of fitting into theories long ago advanced 
(and which were ruthlessly interrupted by so- 
called microbic pathology) and of being a 
logical sequel to well established discoveries. 

Hayem discovered the third corpuscle as 



THE MEDICAL AGE.

long ago as 1878, terming it the haematoblast, 
and claiming that it constituted an anatom- 
ical element of normal blood and was a true 
cell. Recently Doctors Watkins, Holbrook 
and others have pointed out that the haema- 
toblasts, or their accompanying platelets, are 
probably the first haematic indications of 
morbidity — claims that are further substan- 
tiated by Ephraim Cutter as the result of a 
long series of original researches. Even 
when all other symptoms may be absent it is 
claimed that the platelets evidence a de- 
pressed condition of the economy, inviting 
disease; it is possible also that the haemato- 
blasts are natural material essential to the 
nutrition of bacilli. If this is true, the mi- 
crobe will be speedily relegated to its proper 
place as a secondary factor in pathology, for, 
despite the claims made, careful pathologists 
long ago realized that germs are not the fons 
et origo malt, but sequences thereto. 

Those who have watched medical progress 
must have recognized that until the develop- 
ment of the microbic fad the scope of patho- 
logical teaching was much wider and of 
broader conception than now obtains. Up 
to Cohnheim's death, pathological art was 
progressive; then morbid anatomy exclu- 
sively reached the ascendant, the fact being 
sedulously ignored that pathology does not 
deal with death merely, and that its real soul 
and essence is Life! Bacteriology, which 
is a sequence of morbid anatomy, carried the 
physician away from the dead-house to the 
laboratory, and it must be admitted it has 
been of some benefit in that it awakened a 
spirit of experimental inquiry. Bacteriology, 
however, is very far from being pathology, 
and even in so far as it applies to disease it 
is merely adjunctive, while beyond this it be- 
longs to the domain of botany ! While every 
bacteriologist should be a pathologist, and 
every pathologist possess an adequate knowl- 
edge of physiology as well as complete mas- 
tery over morbid anatomy, there is no step 
more to be reprobated than the present tend- 
ency to follow German and other Continental 
enthusiasts and become mere specialists in 
the art of growing bacteria and in immuniza- 
tion — in this respect Americans have cer- 
tainly "out-Heroded Herod." 

While we have no desire to convey the im- 
pression that morbid anatomy is not related 



to pathology — for, as it has ever been, it is 
still an important practical factor therein, 
alike from the student's, investigator's, and 
practitioner's point of view — this much must 
be insisted upon, namely : That the morbid 
physiology of the body and of disease has 
been too much neglected. Year after year 
has seen new text-books without number 
purporting to treat of pathology, that, bar- 
ring a trifle of histology, are devoted ex- 
clusively to bacteriology; indeed, since the 
appearance of Cohnheim's classical work 
nothing has appeared of note that deals 
directly with diseases and their processes, 
and modern students of medicine do not 
realize what the term pathology means — it 
is the old story of giving a stone when bread 
is required. Many of these volumes also are 
merely annotated picture-books whose chief 
merit is— to use the words of Kanthack — 
that they "bring home to us in a painful 
manner the decline of pathological anatomy." 
Further, bacteriology has assumed such pro- 
portions that it endeavors to swamp every- 
thing else; in many institutions it is the 
only study that receives adequate or even 
notable attention. It is notorious that in 
the majority of German and American medi- 
cal schools the chair of Pathology is occupied 
by a bacteriologist, and that even Hygiene is 
taught by the " germ-hunter." The result is 
that sound pathological anatomy has been 
crowded into obscurity and practically for- 
gotten. The chief aim is to render every- 
thing subservient to the microbe, and seek 
contentment in that mediocrity which the 
cultivating and growing of germs opens to 
those incapable of doing real pathological 
work. "Bacteriology," to again quote Kant- 
hack, "satisfies those who are devoid of 
capacity for original research, inasmuch as 
it may be practiced as a fireside game." 



In this connection it seems proper to refer 
to the latest fad in therapeutics, namely, 
serum therapy, announced a year ago with a 
great flourish; and yet, with the remembrance 
of tuberculin and other like fiascos, a large 
number of medical men have exhibited a 
commendable conservatism in regard thereto, 
while would-be "authorities" have rushed to 
the opposite extreme. It has been insisted

even ar the light of calm, impartial 

criticism. At first it was declared the aver- 
mortality from diphtheria had always 
reached* eighty per cent., a statement laughed 
to scorn by men possessed of practical ex- 
perience with the malady. Then the claimed 
ratio of fatalities began to decrease until 
the extreme was placed at twenty-five or 
&gt;ly twenty per cent. — an average that 
1 recognized as excessive even for 
the days when diphtheria was a little-under- 
stood malady. Finally the promoters of the 
new therapy found themselves in a dilemma, 
inasmuch as "authority" declared this treat- 
ment assured a death ratio of just about 
twenty or twenty- five per cent., which was 
tantamount to a declaration that serum pos- 
sessed no curative influence whatever. 

Now came the information from a no less 
esteemed source than Doctor Lennox Brown, 
of London, that the serum was especially apt 
to exercise a deleterious effect on the kid- 
neys, even to a fatal sequel — a report twice 
supplemented by the same author with 
new but equally definite evidence, and subse- 
quently corroborated by scores of practi- 
tioners. In spite of all, however, under the 
morbid stimulus of those seeking notoriety 
and gazettes as "authority," this form of 
therapy has continued to fight its way with 
more or less claimed success up to the pres- 
ent date — in some localities it seems to have 
gained prestige, in others to have lost ground 
rapidly; and now twelve months after its 
introduction its true status is apparently as 
uncertain and ill-defined as on the day of its 
birth. Deaths attributable thereto, more or 
less circumstantially narrated, have appeared 
from various parts of the globe. The demise 
of a young girl in Brooklyn is laid directly 
to this agent, and the evidence adduced led 
the New York Medical Journal — which had 
previously exhibited a predilection in its 
favor — to assume an attitude decidedly con- 
servative and verging closely on distrust.

and therefore produces new elements of de- 
composition." Surgeon Cardeiro, U. S. Navy, 
originally favorably impressed with the serum, 
finally concludes: " We have not the slightest 
basis upon which to found an expectation 
that fewer children will die in the future of 
this disease on account of the serum treat- 
ment." These gentlemen are corroborated 
by Samuel Treat Armstrong, whose evidence 
is equally unassailable. Doctor Winters, 
moreover, openly charged, and sustained by 
evidence, that statistics have been juggled 
with and manipulated in the interests of serum 
therapy, and that cases which never had diph- 
theria were listed as recoveries under the use 
of this medicament. Those who have read 
Doctor Winters' monograph as published in 
the New York Medical Journal cannot but 
feel that an important factor has been over- 
looked in the consideration of serum treat- 
ment, and that is the globucidal power of 
alien serum on the blood of the animal or 
human being into which it is injected. — Thi 
fact was substantiated as far back as 1875 b 
Landois, who found the serum of the dog, 
the horse and the rabbit dissolved the re 
blood-globules of other species with great 
rapidity. Sterling, in his translation of Lan- 



: 



THE MEDICAL AGE.

dois' Physiology, declares: "If the serum of 
one animal is transfused into the blood of 
another animal of different species, the blood- 
corpuscles of the recipient are dissolved, and 
if the change becomes general, death may 
occur," a conclusion identical with that of 
Darenberg. 

Both Hayem and Lazet observed that small 
emboli were produced when the serum of the 
ox was injected into the circulation of dog 
or man, and the act further induced conges- 
tion of the kidneys and suppression of urine. 
In man the serum of the dog decomposed 
both red and white corpuscles, and solid con- 
cretions were formed from the debris. But all 
this is not new: it was well known and demon- 
strated again and again by Claude Bernard. 

It is, however, unnecessary to cite the in- 
numerable medical men who, in all parts of 
the United States, Canada, Great Britain, 
Germany, Belgium, Italy, and Sweden, have 
contributed evidence as to the scores of fatal- 
ities due to the so-called curative serum— their 
name is "Legion." Again, in the Montreal 
City Hospital, and in all the hospitals of Great 
Britain save one, the use of the medicament 
has been abandoned for cause, and this is 
equally true of a great many hospitals upon 
the Continent. At this writing the lay press 
announces that, before the Ontario Health 
Association — composed of the ablest medical 
talent in Canada, and which has just closed a 
successful session at Belleville, — the assertion 
was distinctly and emphatically made, and not 
contradicted, that "the alleged remedy is an 
utter failure." 

Further, in the eagerness to uphold this 
form of therapy, it is charged — though with 
what measure of truth we are not able at this 
writing to determine — that in certain locali- 
ties people suspected of exposure to diph- 
theria have been forcibly quarantined, de- 
tained, and injected, their cases being later 
tabulated as recoveries though there had 
never been any manifestation of any disease; 
the cases of tonsillitis that have been diag- 
nosed diphtheria may be numbered by the 
thousand. It is notorious that in certain 
bacteriological laboratories every case sub- 
mitted for test has been unhesitatingly diag- 
nosed as diphtheria, though a large number 
of these were free from any malady what- 
ever. As has been frequently pointed out, 



it is impossible to distinguish under the 
microscope the Klebs-Loeffler bacillus from 
certain other bacilli, neither can this organ- 
ism be positively differentiated by cultiva- 
tion; further, it is frequently present where 
there is no evidence of morbid process — it 
has even been found in the throat and on the 
fauces of patients two months after conva- 
lescence from diphtheria. 

It is also claimed that individuals have 
been unduly hustled into contagion hospitals 
and subjected to all the annoyances that 
must necessarily result from such arbitrary 
and uncalled-for methods, including loss of 
time, injury to business, etc. If this is true 
it is evident that microbic pathology is be- 
coming desperate; even if but a half-truth, 
such measures must have bred many cases 
of injustice that can only react against the 
medicament and its upholders. If serum 
therapy is possessed of any real practical 
value, it is certainly in great danger of being 
speedily smothered under the remembrance 
of the arbitrary measures adopted in its be- 
half and that are foreign to the candid sense 
of every individual, medical or lay, and 
equally foreign to the principles of law and 
good government. 

Per contra, it must be said there still 
continues to accrue evidence in support of 
serum therapy, though the fact is generally 
ignored that its promoters persistently con- 
tinue to employ and to advise the older 
and more classical modes of treatment* As 



*The following, excerpted by the Medical 
from Munchener Medicinische IVochenschrift, is a 
characteristic report: 

Furth reports results obtained at the clinics at 
Freiburg in the treatment of 100 cases of diphtheria 

with the antitoxin In conjunction with 

the injection of the antitoxin other measures in usual 
employ at the clinics were not omitted. Thus, the air 
of the wards containing the severe cases was kef 
stantly moist by means of the steam-spray; local 
cations or insufflations of precipitated sulphur 
chinolinbenzyl ' rhodanate were made thn 
times a day; children able to do so used potassium 
chlorate or potassium permanganate as a 
inhaled frequently a solution of carbolic acid; an ice- 
collar was applied; bits of ice were swall 
pain was present; and in 'eases of involvement of the 
nose, irrigation of the nares with antiseptic solutions 
-was practiced. Among the ioo cases thus treated 

there were twelve deaths Thirty-one 

required tracheotomy The opinion is 

expressed that antitoxin is a specific in the treatment 
of diphtheria with which no other therapeutic 
measure is to be compared.

remarked In these col- 
umns, the value of any medicament as a 
. be determined only 
. and no claim! 
lade in connection with an 
.:ment, for then the evidence 
led is that which is chiefly lacking. 
It mo imembered, moreover, that with 

disease which will 
brief a period manifest the extren 
malignity ami of hastening convalescence as 
diphtheria; that there is no malady which in 
its ch will in so short a time de- 

p such startling ranges of temperature, 
even from that which denotes impending dis- 
solution down to a degree that positively 
guarantees convalescence. Indeed there is 
no disease (croup perhaps excepted) that 
permits its victims to appear in such perfect 
health for days and hours up to within a few 
moments of the time they are laid in their 
coffins — it is no uncommon experience to see 
a child running about the house and playing, 
and three hours later enveloped in a shroud. 
One thing must be insisted upon, however, 
in behalf of serum therapy — that a large 
number of accidents accredited thereto are 
undoubtedly the results of imperfect methods 
of employment or improper selection of the 
agent; that much of the same sort of evidence 
that is cited against it is equally applicable in 
the reverse sense; and that those opposed 
thereto, in their desire to make good their 
cause, ignore the fact that some of the 
sequehe laid at the door of serum therapy 
are apt to obtain to any severe case of diph- 
theria — albuminous urine and evidences of 
some form of nephritis. Doctor Clarence 
A rev recently pointed out in the Medical 
A r ews the fact that all antitoxin serum, re- 
gardless of its manufactured source, is sub- 
ject to deterioration by age — though this is 
sedulously ignored or denied by interested 
exploiters; and it is well known that pur- 
ported serum was placed upon the Ameri- 
can market practically coincidently with the 
announcement of its discovery, which alone 
ought to be sufficient evidence that it was 
quite a different material from that employed 
abroad and which required months for manu- 
facture. Indeed, the exploiting of one medi- 
cament under this title has called forth the 
scathing criticism that "alleged barbarians 



Q their arrows with such mater: 
Unfortunately there is no law to pn 

the veriest knave from advert- | put- 

ting upon the market a false pr&lt; 
claiming for it all the advantages that l 
to the real— the advertising columns of our 
medical journals are full of such. 

There- are a number of serums in the mar- 
ket known to the initiated to be spurious; 
and yet so anomalous is the attitude of our 
government thereto, and so clumsy the • 
ings of the law, that even mentioning their 
names while pointing out their false claims is 
to render one amenable to prosecution under 
the charge of "maliciously attempting to de- 
stroy a beneficial enterprise." The f.: 
mains, however, that the status of serum 
therapy is far from being what its pro- 
motors desire; that, as already remarked, 
its real value — or its real uselessness for that 
matter— is yet to be determined. The final 
verdict, moreover, must come through the 
labors of honest and unbiased persons who 
will experiment with the medicament per se 
without adjunct remedies, and who will care- 
fully collect and tabulate the results of an 
exhaustive series of clinical reports; there 
must be eliminated, moreover, "diphtheria 
waves" such as dominate different seasons. 
It is to be feared, however, that the pro- 
motors of serum therapy, in their anxiety 
to raise it upon the highest pedestal, have 
overreached themselves, and that the med- 
ical profession will not have the patience 
to give that examination which is neces- 
sary to determine its true character, and 
moreover will not accept without the grav- 
est suspicion the results of even the most 
thorough trial, should such be made. The 
publication of evidence either pro o; 
based upon a single case, or even a group of 
half a dozen cases, proves nothing; and this 
fact invalidates a large amount of evidence 
that has been advanced, both negative and 
positive. It is only by studying cases in 
series in an honest and upright way, both 
with and without serum, and in the same 
wards, with an earnest endeavor to learn 
"the truth, the whole truth, and nothing 
but the truth," regardless of the immediate 
results, that the medical profession can ob- 
tain such reliable data as shall for all time 



THE MEDICAL AGE.

secure its confidence and likewise determine 
the status of this (or any other) medicament. 

Again, rural death statistics must be sep- 
arated from the mortality rate in hospitals, 
since those seeking the aid of the latter are 
for the most part of the ill-fed, ill-nourished 
class — a class that offer conditions most fa- 
vorable to the excessive virulence of any mal- 
ady. There is something to be said, also, in 
favor of the assertion of a prominent Cana- 
dian practitioner, that after many years of 
experience he is inclined to doubt the value 
of any form of medication in diphtheria, and 
would be no way surprised if all remedial 
agents employed up to date should ulti- 
mately prove to be injurious — a statement 
echoed by a number of hearers. Another 
gentleman of equal prominence asserted he 
had lost no cases for a number of years — in 
fact, not since he abandoned all medication 
other than a teaspoonful of whiskey and 
water every one or two hours. 

Whatever the real status of serum therapy, 
we must plead for more honesty in therapeu- 
tics, in clinical reports, and in statistics.

In the search for new remedies for malig- 
nant and wasting diseases, it would seem that 
the best practical results thus far have ac- 
crued to another agent, namely, the Nuclein 
derived from yeast, as recommended by 
Doctor Vaughan, which certainly, whatever 
its value may be, has succeeded in securing 
for itself a surprising amount of positive tes- 
timony. Perhaps one of the reasons why such 
satisfactory results have been obtained is that 
nuclein has been experimented with chiefly 
"upon its merits," and not as a result of asser- 
tions backed up by long tables of erroneous 
statistics which no one has either the time or 
wish to sift. Yeast or "barm," as an empir- 
ical remedy purely, in days gone by won for 
itself golden opinions in typhus, diphtheria, 
consumption, and other maladies; and now its 
nuclein derivative recommends itself in that 
its relations toward disease are apparently 
of a physiological character purely. But 
even nuclein is not without some few detrac- 
tors, largely the result of misunderstanding. 
The editor of the American Medico- Surgical 
Bulletin classes it with antitoxin, and sur- 
mises "this agent and its physiological com- 
pounds behave like strong acids," whereas 



it is a well known fact that both nuclein and 
nucleinic acid are of the weakest acid charac- 
ter; he likewise essays a chemical formula 
(C 29 H 49 N 9 P 3 22 ), that is necessarily val- 
ueless, since such varies in accordance with 
the source whence the nuclein is obtained; it 
is, moreover, incorrect to consider albumen 
alone as the most important constituent of a 
living substance, the cell, since nuclein-albu- 
men, nuclein, and nucleinic acid each play an 
equally important role. The readiness with 
which nucleinic acid combines with albumin- 
ous bodies, may explain its supposed proper- 
ties, in part at least, for H. Kossel declares a 
one-half-per-cent. solution of nucleinic acid 
is capable of destroying in a very brief period 
of time the germs that accompany cholera, 
typhoid, and pyaemia. He further deems it 
highly probable that nucleinic acid is one of 
the substances which the economy has at its 
disposal for the express purpose of antago- 
nizing alien organisms. 

Neither is nuclein to be classed as a " purely 
artificial product of the analytic laboratory," 
as has been charged. Nuclein-albumen, from 
which nucleinic acid is derived, is a constit- 
uent of young living cells, whether of the 
animal or vegetable kingdom; thus we have 
nucleins as a component part of the cell 
nucleus. Again, true nuclein is insoluble in 
alcohol, and acid in reaction, quite different 
from the material that has led to adverse 
comment — there are so-called nucleins in the 
market which present characteristics diamet- 
rically opposite to those just outlined, but 
such are not entitled to the name and pos- 
sess none of the attributes that belong to 
nuclein proper; in other words, any value 
that may be possessed by an alkaline nu- 
clein, or markedly alcoholic nuclein solution, 
is that only which may be derived from any 
medicament through what in modern days is 
termed "suggestion." Neither can nuclein 
be in any way compared with alkaloidal sub- 
stances that are employed hypodermatically: 
These latter are, so to speak, emergency 
products; are rarely used more than once or 
twice in any case, or at most not employed 
continuously for more than a few hours; are 
dissolved in small quantities of water, and 
injected in strong solution for immediate 
effect. Per contra, nuclein demands to be 
employed constantly and persistently in large

Synthetic Caffeine.— 

Th:&gt; chemical problem has apparentl 
been .solved by E. Fisher and I &gt;. Arch, \vh 
claim to have secured a true product. It is 
fortunate, perhaps, that the synthetic sa 
as yet be produced only at a cost consider- 
ably greater than that of the natural and 
vegetable alkaloid; and while the result may 
be of scientific importance, we fail to seel 
where or how it can be of practical value; 
synthetic caffeine certainly is not needed as 
an addition to either therapeutics or materia 
medica. 

Apomorphine versus Tobacco.— 

Doctor Waugh recently heralded Apomor- 
phine as a specific for the tobacco habit, 
giving in doses to the point of slight nausea. 
The weed, he says, " will get very rank about 
the time nausea begins to be felt." 

This is not according to our experience. 
On the contrary, many devotees to nicotine 
find a chew of tobacco effectually quells and 
overcomes slight nausea, whether due to 
apomorphine or other cause. 

Brief Wisdom.— 

The theory of medicine has been cultivated 
until the practice is lost in a nebulous haze. 
The object of medicine is to cure disease, 
not to ascertain, experimentally, how much 
the human organism will endure before it 
succumbs, nor to pervert facts for purposes 
of self-glorification or self-advancement. 

Acknowledgment.— 

The editor of The Medical Age acknowl- 
edges an invitation to be present at the 
seventh annual convocation of the Tri- State 
Medical Society of Alabama, Georgia, and 
Tennessee, at Chattanooga, October Sth, 9th, 
and 10th. An attractive programme is prom- 
ised. 

Cold in Pneumonia. — 

Doctor Thos. J. Mays records seventy-four 
cases of congestion of lungs treated with ice- 
cold applications, with only two deaths. This 
is certainly suggestive.

Items and News, 



Necessity of Frequent Visits.— 

The Supreme Court of California (Todd v. 
Myers, 40 Cal., 355), in an action brought by 
a physician for professional services — the 
defense being that the visits were too fre- 
quent and not necessary — rules that: 

The defendant having admitted the employment 
of the plaintiff as a physician to treat his wife and 
children, the plaintiff was the proper judge of the 
necessity of frequent visits, and in the absence of 
proof to the contrary the court will presume that 
all the professional visits made were deemed neces- 
sary and were properly made. 

It would be a dangerous doctrine for the 
sick to require a physician to be able to 
prove the necessity of each visit before he 
can recover for services. This is necessarily 
a matter of judgment, and one concerning 
which no one save the attending physician 
can decide. It depends not only upon the 
condition of the patient, but in some degree 
upon the course of treatment adopted. — The 
Sam tartan. 

Neurasthenia.— 

The modern tendency to attribute ill-health 
to nerve weakness is shown by the rapid in- 
crease in alleged nerve bracers. Patent med- 
icines and medicines which are not patented 
flood the markets, all claiming to furnish 
nerve food or nerve stimulant. Some of 
them are helpful, others are worse than use- 
less. Give the nerves a fair show and they 
will get on without these aids. Live ration- 
ally, work rationally, play rationally, and the 
nerves will take care of themselves. Run 
the physical machinery beyond its capacity, 
or abuse it in any way, and the nerves will 
sound the warning. When they do, do not 
give them something to silence them, as one 
might a fretful child, but heed the warning 
and mend your ways of living or working. — 
Exchange. 

A Unique Prescription.— 

A gentleman in Virginia, exerting himself 
one day, felt a sudden pain, and, fearing some 
internal injury, sent for a negro who made 
pretensions to medical skill. The negro, 
having sagely investigated the case, prepared 
and administered a dose with the utmost con- 
fidence of speedy cure. No relief being ob- 
tained, however, a physician was sent for, 
who inquired of the negro what he had given. 
" Rosin and alum, sir ! " " What did you give 
them for?" continued the doctor. "Why," 
replied Sambo, "de alum to draw de parts 
togedder, and de rosin to sodder 'em." — 
Healthy Home. 



An Interesting Experiment 

Doctor Schleich, of Berlin, recently gave 
an interesting demonstration at the Sydney 
(New South Wales) Hospital. He induced 
local anaesthesia by the injection of a saline 
solution into the tissues surrounding the part 
to be operated upon. The theory is that the 
pressure of the fluid paralyzes the nerve ex- 
tremities, and therefore removes all chance 
of pain. The demonstration was altogether 
satisfactory, both to the patients operated 
upon and to the attending surgeons.— Aus- 
tralian Journal of Pharmacy. 

Negroes and Phthisis.— 

During the slavery days, physicians used to 
say that the African race did not have con- 
sumption. Since 1865, however, this malady 
has become very common, and during ten 
years I do not remember to have been with- 
out a case among the colored people; it is 
more common among them than among the 
whites, and appears to be of the acute variety. 
Tubercular negroes seldom last longer than 
six months. — Doctor J. Atkinson, in Medi- 
cal World. 

Shall We Deserve This Epithet?— 

The Medical Cuckoo is the American phy- 
sician that rushes to the public to proclaim 
to the world the "infallible" value of every 
sensational fad sprung in a foreign country. 
When will American physicians (and Ameri- 
can girls) overcome their sensational, mawk- 
ish yearning for exotic oddities ? Let's be 
original; we have the brains in America. — 
North American Medical Review. 

Science.— 

Do you believe that science consists in a 
long-winded, pointless argument written to 
show how much one knows about something 
that "ain't so?" — Medical Brief . 

Headache of Pregnancy. — 

This symptom should always be regarded 
with suspicion. It is frequently evidence of 
uraemia and threatening eclampsia. — New 
York Medical Times. 

Worthy of Consideration.— 

Doctor Gould suggests the use of the pre- 
fixes dui, tri, quadri, quinti, sexti, before the 
word para, to designate the numerical posi- 
tion of a multi-para. 

A Free Translation.— 

Sir W T illiam Gull was wont to say the true 
translation of the Greek proverb " Know thy- 
self," was "Test your urine." — Medical Times.

Most works on obstetrics relate to the en- 
tire subject of parturient women; this there- 
fore is something of a departure in that it 
deals only with surgical obstetrics. The vol- 
ume is graphic in style and discusses in regu- 
lar order such topics as obstetric asepsis and 
antisepsis; obstetric dystocia and its deter- 
mination; artificial abortion and the induc-

B. Saunders, Philadelphia. 

This book claims to be a manual for 
mothers and nurses, and gives evidence of 
considerable painstaking on the part of the 
author. Nevertheless we can but deprecate 
the publication of such works, since, while 
such advice is all well enough in a general 
way, when it is supplemented by condensed 
a?tiological and pathological information with 
set formulas in the way of therapeusis, it be- 
comes pernicious, and tends to most danger- 
ous domestic quackery.

Doctor Burnett has earned considerable 
reputation in the treatment of the gouty, and 
this little work fully exemplifies his ideas 
both as to management and pathology. He 
justly remarks that to attain success it is 
necessary to have a clear idea of what con- 
stitutes the various parts of gout, and also 
differentiate between its pre-deposit and post- 
deposit symptoms.

Therapeutic Brevities. 

Abuse of Opium. — Our text-books recom- 
mend opium in almost all diseases as a cure- 
all. In painful maladies the sufferer demands 
prompt relief, and as opium is the long-used 
and abused analgesic it is the first agent sug- 
gested to the anxious sympathetic physician; 
[hence its almost constant use in daily prac- 
tice. Then, in epidemic visitations, where 
lithe physician is overrun with professional 
»; engagements, he is often led to give an opiate 
■I to quiet his patient so that he may get greatly 
needed rest; but it is well known that this 
ndrug is rarely curative in any disease, and 
I often does great harm, as it locks up most 
'of the secretions, and in many cases tends to 
I congestion of the brain. And the oft-repeated 
Huse of the drug is productive of one of the 
| most degrading habits known. The prac- 
Itice of giving opiates for coughs has an evil 
l ( tendency, as opium, in any form, locks up 
(the excretions, thus retaining detritus in the 
^air-passages, greatly to the patient's deta- 
il ment. Ammonium chloride is a much better 
Band safer remedy in coughs. The headaches 
for which opiates are often taken can be 
l! readily relieved by acetanilid. Gastralgia 
| may be relieved by hydrocyanic acid alter- 
nated with sub-carbonate of bismuth, and, if 
of a colicky character, will yield to pepper- 
t mint. — Doctor I. J. M. Goss, in Courier of 
I Medicine.

use of Amyl nitrite. Artificial respiration 
practiced simultaneously helps the entrance 
of Amyl into the system. All other methods 
of treatment should be secondary, since such 
require more time and more assistance from 
others. In the case of a young woman with 
valvular heart disease to whom I reluctantly 
administered chloroform, the breathing sud- 
denly became shallow; the face dusky; the 
pulse a mere thread, and it even seemed to 
disappear for many seconds. The operation 
was stopped and Amyl nitrite instantly em- 
ployed; and as soon as it entered the system 
by means of the still feeble respiration, the 
pulse rapidly returned and became strong 
again.— Doctor W. M. Killen, in British 
Journal of Dental Science. 



Influence of Syphilis on Tabes Dorsalis. — 
Possibly a third of the cases of locomotor 
ataxia may be of syphilitic origin. This 
malady, when it appears twenty or thirty 
years after primary syphilis, and is not pre- 
ceded by any decided syphilitic manifesta- 
tion during this interval, is probably not 
syphilitic. So-called syphilitic ataxia has no 
definite characteristics of its own, such as 
belong to cerebral syphilis, and antisyphilitic 
treatment as a rule does more harm than 
good; in any case in which this form of 
treatment does no good in fifteen to twenty 
days, I believe it useless to persevere with 
it. On the whole, I surmise the importance 
of syphilis as a cause of tabes has been 
greatly exaggerated. — Doctor Cardarelli, 
in British Medical Journal. 



Codeine. — This is my favorite medicament 
for pains in the stomach and alimentary 
canal generally, also in kidneys, bladder and 
other hollow organs. It is a prime remedy 
where the ganglionic system of nerves is in- 
volved, even if the heart is the seat of the 
trouble. Gelsemium and Codeine work ad- 
mirably well together. Recently I treated a 
case of uterine and sympathetic bladder 
trouble successfully with this combination; 
the symptoms were pain, frequent and scanty 
passages of urine, and inability to rest or 
sleep; patient was worn out with the con- 
stant strain upon her. The combination 
afforded prompt relief. — Doctor Joseph 
Adolphus, in American Medical Journal. 



Amyl Nitrite in Syncope. — Those who meet 
with threatened cardiac syncope during 
operations should rely upon the immediate 



Chronic Catarrh of Respiratory Mucous

Cream of Tartar in I — I have 

employed Cream of Tartar in 280 cases of 
gonorrhoea, On account of its mild action 

it is f s rvii e in urethral injections, even to 
five a day; it subdues the inflammation, ar- 

tbe discharge, and is possessed of emi- 
nent antiseptic anil absorbent properties. In 
profuse suppuration in wounds or cavities 
with necrosing walls itVill yield good results 
if applied locally. In buboes, chancres, and 
syphilitic ulcerations, as well as in balanitis, 

a good local application. Finally it is 
cheap, devoid of odor, painless, and easily 
handled. — Doctor Oteri, in Journal de .1/ d- 
tcitu de Paris. 



Epilepsy. — After an experience of twenty- 
one years, I regard Ammonium muriate as a 
specific for all forms of epilepsy not arising 
from traumatism. I employ the granulated 
salt, filling a half-pint bottle half-full, com- 
pleting the filling with water, and prescribe 
for an adult a tablespoonful every three 
hours. I give to both children and adults 
all the stomach will bear, prescribing often- 
times in connection with elm-tea, mint-water, 
or gum arabic. I aim to so saturate the sys- 
tem with the salt that the perspiration will 
yield it plentifully. — Doctor H. J. Coox, in 
Medical World. 



Uterine Affections. — Cornutine citrate, an 
alkaloid of ergot, is a brownish amorphous 
powder, readily soluble in water; Lewitzky 
regards it as one of the most certain means 
of exciting uterine contractions. Meisel finds 
it useful in urethral, vesical, and uterine haem- 
orrhage.

Plantago in Toothache. — It is not too 1 

to say that about seventy per cent, of the 
cases of toothache that come under our 
notice may be : ully treated by 

tago, while a goodly number of the remain- 
ing thirty per cent, may be greatly relieved 
and benefited thereby. Preferably should be

with a brush or feather. 

It worked very well in a distress 
marked face for one of my patients.— 
tor Brodnax, in Medical Summary. 



Constipation. — Contraction of the external 
sphincter muscle has much to do in producing 
constipation. If there is fissure, the muscle 
is spasmodically contracted. Frequently 
there is contraction from other causes. If 
there is found a tight sphincter in constipa- 
tion, as is very often the case, much is to be 
gained by divulsion or stretching. Often 
when divulsion has been performed for some 
disease of the rectum, the constipation has 
been cured also. — Louisville M &lt; nthly.

Asphyxia from Illuminating Gas. — A hypo- 
dermatic injection of Xitro-glycerin, one- 
hundredth of a grain, is said to speedily

effective in poisoning from charcoal fumes 
or natural gas. The remedy has the merit 
of being physiological, at all events.— Kn. ]

How to Employ Empty Capsules. — It should 
be borne in mind, in employing empty cap- 
sules, that the advantages of these conven- 
ient aids to medicine are in a large measure 
lost when the contents are made in the form 
of a bolus or pill mass with excipients, or 
when the capsule is packed tightly. In select- 
ing a capsule for the administration of pow- 
ders, etc., it is always desirable to choose a 
large size in order that the contained medi- 
cine shall be in as loose form as possible. 



Typhoid Fever. — Keep the patient in bed 
[until for an entire week the temperature has 
been normal, and feed him exclusively on 
(Sterilized liquid diet as long as he remains 
! on his back: 

At the beginning of the disease give ten 
grains of calomel on alternate days: 

Give one grain of carbolic acid and three 
! drops of tincture of iodine, every four hours, 
during the entire illness. — Doctor Gusta- 
vus Elliot, in Yale Medical Journal. 



Passiflora for Odontalgia. — Recently a pa- 
tient came to me suffering intensely with 
toothache, and appealed for relief, if pos- 
sible, without extraction. Passiflora sug- 
gested itself as being a possible soporific, so 
I saturated a pledget of cotton and filled the 
cavity of the tooth, with the result of almost 
instantaneous relief. Since that time I have 
made numerous like experiments with the 
same absolute results. — Doctor Spees, in 
Georgia Eclectic. 



Silk versus Catgut. — Kocher, of Verne, uses 
antiseptic silk sutures exclusively, having 
abandoned catgut seven years ago. In 471 
operations for goitre, silk was used, and 
eighty-five per cent, healed by first intention; 
while in 108 cases in which catgut was used, 
suppuration occurred in fifty-three per cent. 
Lauenstein recently collected samples of cat- 
gut from different manufacturers, and out of 
106 specimens founc} twenty of dangerous 
character. — Times and Register. 



Carbolic Acid in Gonorrhoea. — One drop of 
Phenic acid duly diluted, and ingested three 
times daily — gradually increasing the dose 
of acid to three minims, — and an injec- 
tion of ten grains to the ounce of water, 
affords most excellent results. Indeed, I 
have cured cases without any resort to this 
. or any other injection, in from eight to four- 
| teen days. — Doctor Benj. Brodnax, in Cin- 
cinnati Medical Journal. 



"Toadstool" and "Mushroom" Poisoning. — 
It is not unlikely that some of the deaths 
ascribed to the eating of poisonous fungi may 
have been really caused by varieties naturally 
edible, but rendered poisonous by being grown 
on manure heaps of miscellaneous filth, which 
supply to it not only the richest nourishment 
but also poisonous exhalations, which the ar- 
rangement of its " cap" permits it very readily 
and effectually to absorb. — The Lancet (Lon- 
don). 



Hay Fever. — One teaspoonful of Syrup 
Hydriodic Acid (P., D. &amp; Co.'s) every 'two 
hours in water, will sometimes arrest an at- 
tack of this distressing malady within twenty- 
four hours.— Richmond Journal of Practice. 

[This is practically the " iodide treatment," 
and offers great advantage over iodide of 
potassium in that it is less likely to disturb 
the stomach. — Ed.1 



Chorea. — Put the patient to bed, regulate 
the diet carefully, prohibit all stimulants, in- 
cluding tea and coffee, and give Fowler's 
Solution in ascending doses to the point of 
toleration. In addition it is well to accus- 
tom the patient to a series of systematic 
exercises, such as will tend to give control of 
coordinate movements. — Jour?ial of Materia 
Medica. 



Cotton-root as a Hcemostatic. — Cotton-root 
bark is a reliable and harmless haemostatic, 
is available in metrorrhagia, haemoptysis, 
haematuria, and epistaxis. It may be given 
in doses of twenty to thirty minims of fluid 
extract for several days. There are no dis- 
turbances of digestive organs. — Doctor 
Markevitsch, in Medical Standard. 



Spermatorrhoea. — 

3 Cornutine citrate, % grain. 
Kaolin, 100 grains. 
Tragacanth mucilage, to make mass. 

Make 50 pills: One to be taken morning and 
evening. 

— American Medico-Surgical Bulletin. 



Saw Palmetto in Pelvic Diseases. — Sabal 
serrulata is a good remedy in pelvic conges- 
tion, if employed in doses of ten drops every 
two hours. It secures successful results in 
peritonitis, even when the disease is compli- 
cated with cellulitis. — Professor Elbridge 
C. Price, in American Homceopathist.

dition. \ ever 

know anything of the Ts'o-pun, an old 
Chm&lt; - iledica; the majority merely 

know how to write out a few old stork pre- 
scriptions copied OOt ae antiquated 
■uent that came down to the family as 
an heirloom. A man engaged ifl the kiang- 
nan Arsenal as a petty overseer, on being 
dismissed from his post, stole some secret 
from a Buddhist priest ami 
then hung out a sign informing the public 
that he was ready to guarantee a perfect cure 
for any ailment. 

In the district of Ching-poo there are two 
villages, Mang-ho and Tsung-ko — each hav- 
ing a family of doctors, celebrated all over 
China, and during an illness of the Empress- 
Dowager one of them was called to Peking, 
but Her Majesty, fortunately or unfortu- 
nately, did not ask him to prescribe. The 
patients that go to these places are either 
hypochondriacs or incurables, and I have 
never seen one that had either functional or 
organic disease who returned cured. 

One sometimes hears of the Imperial Col- 
lege of Medicine in Peking, and a foreigner 
is sure to make an egregious mistake, sup- 
posing it is some institution like the Royal 
College of Physicians and Surgeons in the 
West. It is only a handful of self-styled 
doctors who have no lectures to give, and do 
not write articles for medical journals, as 
there are no readers; a Chinese medical stu- 
dent in the proper sense of the term has 
never existed. 

The Chinese apothecary does a large busi- 
ness, for the doctors prescribe large bowlfuls 
of decoctions for every complaint; conse- 
quently he must have a large supply of herbs 
and roots to meet the demand, and so ran 
sacks creation for odds and ends. Of the 
drugs one may have some idea by reading 
the following advertisement: 

Recently Hongkong and the provinces of Kwang- 
tung being visited by the plague the Provincial 
High Authorities have published a prescription 
called Plague Cure which is infallible. Our shop 
has already prepared this medicine for the two 
great benevolent institutions in Canton, where it has 
been used with invariable success. In this prescrip- 
tion there is one ingredient called Son of Stone Drag- 
on, which is found in the mountains in the province 
of Chekiang. Through the agency of our branch 
office in Hangehow we have obtained a superior 
variety of this stony son of a Dragon, and together 
with other valuable drugs we have made this mix- 
ture. During the compounding, we have reverently 
said a thousand pra\ I v we offer this medi-

1 wonder who discovered such potent vir- 
tues in a little lizard, which in its native 
province of Chekiang is always regarded with 
disfavor. 

For various female complaints and diseases 
"Dragon" and "Phoenix" pills are largely 
sold, coated with wax, either white or yellow, 
and of the size of an Fnglish walnut; their 
efficacy is of course lauded to the skies; no 
doubt they are composed of such drugs as 
aloes, myrrh, etc. The Chinese druggi- 
their anxiety to make money, also advertise 
drugs to restore the virile power in a profli- 
gate, and cause the sterile to bear offspring.* 

But there are stuffs which the Chinese 
druggists do conscientiously collect, with 
milch expense and labor, but which are 
nevertheless inert and useless — as tigers' 
bones, bears' paws, deer's horns, etc. Tigers' 
•bones are ground into powder and used in 
plasters for internal injuries; bears' paws are 
boiled to a jelly and used as a powerful alter- 
ative for the weak and aged; deer's horns are 
sawn into thin discs, boiled down, and given 
to renew wasted vitality. — A young horn is 
considered as particularly valuable when it 
is a little ruddy and somewhat translucent. 

When every available drug has been pressed 
into service and found wanting, the China- 
man resorts to superstition, or, if I may be 
pardoned, to a "faith cure!" — for humanity 
is much the same the world over. But the 
great danger is, that they often resort to the 
fetich first and neglect a rational medication. 
Unfortunately also superstition often retains 
its victims long in its thraldom, but sometimes 
it gives a sort of pleasant rounding to the 
recovery of an important member of a family 
— as, for instance, when a father gets well 
from severe illness because his filial son cuts 
a piece from his arm and embodies it in the 
prescribed remedy. Every year the Peking 
Gazettr gravely makes honorable mention of 
filial sons and dutiful daughters-in-law who 
have maimed themselves in loving devotion 
to parents.

THE MEDICAL AGE.

In the region of Hein Fung in the early 
fifties there was a local rebellion in the 
Shanghai city. During that atrocious period 
many a man was slaughtered and butchered, 
and his gall-bladder taken out and invariably 
swallowed by some savage chieftain with the 
idea that it would brace up his courage — this 
latter being said to reside in the gall. The 
Chinese word for bravery means a large gall. 
In the History of the Three Kingdoms, 
mention is made of a distinguished general 
[|who, on an eye being struck out, immediately 
picked it up and said: "This is made of my 
father's essence and my mother's blood; I 
dare not throw it away." And forthwith he 
swallowed it. 

These are instances showing that from 
3time immemorial the people of China have 
had a notion of the peculiar virtue o'f the 
human body; and not only so, but even ex- 
crementitious and effete matters are some- 
jtimes used. Thus solid faeces are moulded 
into the shape and size of a chestnut and 
hermetically sealed in a jar and buried in the 
ground for a number of years, then taken 
out again, when they have a gray color and 
no odor, and are carefully covered with gilt 
and stowed away to be called for by some 
[eccentric medico, when they are euphemisti- 
cally denominated "Golden Beans." A 
human placenta is sometimes cleaned, cut 
up in pieces, and given to a white duck to 
feed, and after a few days the latter is killed, 
cooked, and given to the patient. Cat's 
placenta is roasted to ashes on a tile and 
taken in a warm drink, for consumption; 
young boy's urine is taken in samshu and 
sugar, though parents generally object to 
this, having an idea that it will have a reflex 
action in shortening such a boy's life. Of 
course there are many other things infinitely 
more unspeakable that are or may be used, 
in the despairing hope of life, but the fore- 
going I know from personal observation. 

But are there no Chinese drugs and reme- 
dies that are worthy to be rescued from 
oblivion? Certainly. Many have already been 
naturalized in the Western pharmacopoeias, 
such as rhubarb, camphor, mercury, musk, 
etc. And there are some empirical methods 
that will surely reward a trial, but are either 
not known or are ignorantly sneered at be- 
cause of Chinese origin. For instance: when 
a child has eaten too much or otherwise 
brought on discomfort to the abdomen, noth- 
ing is so effective as to put from two drachms 
to an ounce of pi-siau (native sulphate of 
soda) in a thin cotton band and apply to the 
abdomen; next morning the stuff has almost 
entirely disappeared (very likely by absorp- 
tion, evaporation, or mechanical loss), the 



abdomen has subsided, and the child is well. 
This is a pleasant way of using a cathartic, 
is easily done, and is effective. Another 
empirical method is scraping or pinching the 
skin for mild cholera, sunstroke, etc. This 
consists of scraping the back till it is striped 
like a zebra— it looks barbarous, but its effect 
is instantaneous. In the sickly months of 
the summer, when one feels out of sorts, 
with perhaps a touch of colic, first let his 
spine be scraped clear down to the lumbar 
region, then the median line in front, and 
either side of the ribs, and he will feel the 
charm right away; of course, this is nothing 
more than counter-irritation, and brings the 
blood to the surface to be redistributed, but 
no medicine in the pharmacopoeia can give 
such rapid and happy effects under the cir- 
cumstances. A milder method is, pinching 
the skin of the neck till it is covered with 
red vertical stripes. There can be no mis- 
take in these methods being useful, as I have 
experienced their benefits myself many times 
in these nearly twenty years. With the ex- 
ception of these few gleams of phosphores- 
cence, it is all darkness in the medical horizon 
of China. — Doctor Suvooxg, in China Medi- 
cal Missionary Journal. 



Evolution of the Corset. — Doctor Have- 
lock Ellis remarks if would be interesting to 
trace the origin and development of the 
modern waist in women. The Greeks of the 
finest period knew nothing of it. During the 
period of decadence women began to com- 
press the body with the apparent object of 
emphasizing the sexual attraction of a con- 
spicuously large pelvis. Hippocrates vigor- 
ously denounced the women of Cos for 
constricting the waist with a girdle. The 
Romans adopted this practice from the de- 
praved Greeks, and Martial often alludes to 
the small waists of women of his time. Ga- 
len speaks in the same way as the modern 
physician regarding the evils of tight lacing. 
Since then matters have changed but very 
slightly. The apparent development of the 
pelvis has been further artificially exagger- 
ated by that contrivance which in Elizabethan 
times was called a "bum-roll," and more re- 
cently a "bustle." The tightening of the 
waist does not merely emphasize the pelvic 
sexual characters; it also emphasizes the not 
less important thoracic sexual characters. 
As Doctor Louis Robinson expresses it: "It 
is very likely one of the reasons (and there 
must be strong ones) for the persistent habit 
of tightening up the belly-girth among Chris- 
tian damsels, is that such constriction renders 
the breathing thoracic and so advertises the

old, who for a year had suffered with prostatic 
hypertrophy that failed to yield to the usual 
therapeutic measures. Relief was finally af- 
forded by ligature and division of the vas 
deferens. Six and a half weeks after the 
operation, retention of urine and incontinence 
had disappeared, and the bladder was toler- 
ant of urine for seven hours during the night; 
and the urine, previously purulent and at 
times hemorrhagic, was clear and otherwise 
normal. The prostate itself, which prior to 
the operation was of decidedly abnormal size, 
became scarcely appreciable upon rectal ex- 
amination. The vas deferens from the point 
of division pursued an irregular course, and 
was thickened and nodular in places; the epi- 
didymis smaller than normal, particularly at 
its distal extremity and in its body; the tes- 
ticle reduced about one-half in size.

Reynolds mentioned points of pathological 
difference in the hands in cases of chronic 
rheumatism and chronic rheumatoid arthritis 
as compared with those found in the hands 
in chronic gout. In chronic rheumatic con- 
ditions, as a rule, the lesions are found ii 
symmetrical joints to an equal extent, anc 
the deformities produced are in most cases 
similar. In chronic gout, on the contrary, 
the changes in the hands are found in asym- 
metrical joints to an extent differing much 
on the two sides, the resulting deformitic 
being totally different. — Quarterly Media

tines has only done harm, as must necessarily 
be the case; the bowels, unless paralyzed, 
continue to move frequently but ineffectively, 
and toxins are absorbed, and with children 
there may be convulsions. Calomel or cas- 
tor oil and spiced syrup of rhubarb should 
be given to secure efficient purgation, or the 
intestine should be irrigated with warm saline 
solution. After this, employ an efficient an- 
tiseptic. When desired, bismuth salicylate 
may be added as an auxiliary astringent, and 
if an opiate is additionally needed, Dover's 
powder may be employed. Diet, of course, 
must be properly regulated. — Philadelphia

OUTLINES OF SANITARY ORGANIZATION 

OF SOME OF THE GREAT ARMIES 

OF THE WORLD.* 

BY MAJOR JOHN VAN RENSSELAER HOFF, SUR- 
GEON U. S. ARMY. 

Military Sanitation may be defined as the 

art of preserving the health of soldiers, and 

hence is extremely comprehensive in that it 

includes not only military medicine and sur- 

jgery, but everything that pertains to the pre- 

I vention and cure of disease and injury under 

lithe peculiar and varied conditions of military 

He, and demands of its followers, besides a 

I knowledge of scientific questions of treatment, 

; : very exact military training and execution. 

One of the most important subdivisions of 
I this great subject is Organization, and yet I 
I venture to say that almost during this entire 
generation no professional subject has at- 
l tracted less attention in our country than 
\ military sanitary organization, and conse- 
? quently none is less understood. 

With a view to a more general dissemina- 
1 tion of a knowledge of this subject, I invite 
(attention to: 

I. THE RUSSIAN ARMY. \ 

Here sanitary organization is based upon 
. the regimental hospital, each fighting unit 
\ (battalion) having its own sanitary personnel, 
[appliances, and transport. Upon this, in 
I active service, is engrafted a divisional or- 
| ganization following the tines of modern mili- 
tary sanitation. 

The sanitary personnel, the surgeons, have 
no military rank, but belong to a class des- 
ignated "official" — which includes all per- 
| sons not actually fighting men — and are 



*Read before the Association of Military Sur- 
geons. 

tData furnished by the Division of Military In- 
formation, Adjutant-General's Office, U. S. A. 



considered as civilians attached. In com- 
mon with all other government officials, they 
have standing according to their rank in the 
"Chin." All Russian military officials are 
known technically as "Voyennii Klassnii 
Chinovniki," and belong to one or the other 
of the following named classes: Chaplains, 
intendance officials, surgeons, veterinarians, 
artillery officials (" Artilleriiskii Chinovniki"), 
engineer officials (" Injeniernii Chin."), apoth- 
ecaries, officials of the various educational 
establishments, etc. 

In the foregoing groups there are no 
special names for grades, which are only 
denoted by the particular class rank in the 
"Chin" which the individual official has, and 
which is, in effect, a social or court standing. 
For example: All surgeons are designated 
"vrachi," yet they have rank in the "Chin" 
from the Third to the Ninth Class — the high- 
est medical officer having the former and the 
lowest (junior surgeon) the latter. The high- 
est apothecary official ranks with the Fourth 
Class, etc. All surgeons wear a uniform of 
dark green cloth, the coat (tunic) having 
cuffs and collar of the same, but piped with 
scarlet, and the shoulder knots narrower than 
those of combatant officers and ornamented 
with silver lace; the trousers are uniform in 
color with the tunic, but without stripe; the 
undress cap is also of dark green, with band 
of the same piped with scarlet. The subor- 
dinate personnel wear the same uniform as the 
regiment to which their hospital belongs. 

The organization of the persojinel of the 
Medical Department of the Russian Army is 
as follows: 

Chief Medical Department. — One chief sur- 
geon, one assistant, one chief inspector, four 
principal officials (surgeon, veterinarian, phar- 
macist, and oculist), thirteen surgeons, one 
pharmacist, eighteen minor officials, forty-five 
clerks, four couriers. In addition, this de- 
partment has at its disposal five surgeons,

THE MEDICAL AGE. 



fifteen pharmacists, fifteen veterinarians, 
twenty-eight junior "feldshers" whose duties 
. i to those of the "hospital corps" 
in the U. S v my: 

- In each 1 1 b 

partment there are 
One chief, one district medical ins; 

tants (surgeon and pharmai 
ocul:- : narian, one surgeon and 

one pharr: ctaries, and an indefi- 

nite number of "feldshers" and clerks: [n 
\rmy Corps, one surgeon and 
One " feldsher": Staff of Infantry or Cavalry 
Division, one division surgeon: Staff of Field 
and Reserve Artillery Brigade, two surgeons, 
one veterinarian, and seven "feldshers": 
Staff of Sapper and Railway Brigade, one 
surgeon. 

In tJie Lint-. — In an Infantry Regiment of 
four battalions there are: One senior surgeon, 
four junior ditto ("vrachi "), one senior and 
four junior "feldshers" (dressers), one com- 
pounder ("abtechnii feldsher"), fourteen 
dresser pupils, one hospital sergeant (nadzi- 
ratri volniki"), and three hospital orderlies 
— all these are classed as non-combatants. 
The average strength of the infantry bat- 
talion is about iooo of all ranks, and the 
companies in a four-battalion regiment are 
numbered from i to 16. All of the non- 
combatant officials in a regiment are grouped 
into what is called a non-combatant com- 
pany, which is not included in the num- 
bering. 

The medical personnel allotted to other 
fighting units is in proportion to strength, 
based upon the requirements of an infantry 
regiment. 

A Cavalry Regiment has usually from 777 
to 1000 men, depending upon the number of 
squadrons — four or six. A four-squadron 
regiment has: One senior and one junior 
surgeon, one veterinarian, six "feldshers" (in 
a six-squadron regiment, seven), four veteri- 
nary "feldshers," two "feldsher" pupils, one 
supervisor of sick (non-commissioned officer), 
and two hospital attendants. 

The Artillery is organized into brigades of 
six battalions each, the average strength be- 
ing 1 100 of all ranks in each brigade. A foot 
battery has two "feldshers," one "feldsher" 
pupil, and one hospital attendant; a horse 
battery the same; a mortar battery, four 



" feldshers " and I endant; th 

artillery parks, flying and movable, each oh 
surge 

A Sapper Battalion is allowed one surgeon, 
"feldshers," five "feldsher" pupilfl 
two hospital attendants. 

\ Reserve Infantry Battalion — four com- 
panies — has one senior and one junior sur- 
geon, seven "feldshers," five "feldsher" pu- 
pils. A Fortress Infantry Battalion the same. 
A 1 &gt;epot Cavalry "Cadre" — one surgeon, one 
veterinarian, four " feldshers," four veterinary 
"feldshers," and two hospital attendant.-. 

The material, tentage, etc., of the regi- 
mental hospital, which always accompanies 
the fighting organization to which it belongs, 
is transported in four one-horse medical- 
stores carts; besides these there are four am- 
bulance wagons, each drawn by four horses, 
and a two-horse wagon to carry thirty-two 
stretchers — two per company. 

In peace or war the regimental medical 
units are completely organized, and the per- 
sonnel is identical, save that in war eight ad- 
ditional junior "feldshers" replace the four- 
teen pupil "feldshers," and the capacity of 
the hospital is raised from sixteen to eighty- 
four beds — i.e., twenty-one to each battalion 
a thousand strong. 

In addition to the "feldshers," each of whom 
carries a knapsack containing dressing ma- 
terials, six men are detailed from each com- 
pany specially to act as bearers. A four- 
battalion regiment — sixteen companies, each 
containing two hundred and fifty men — fur- 
nishes ninety-six bearers from the combatant 
strength, who wear the arm band of the 
Geneva Convention, but only when actually 
employed in bearer work. During an action, 
the regimental medical personnel form col- 
lecting-stations to which the wounded are 
carried; but the regimental hospital is not 
pitched, ordinarily, except at the time the 
regiment goes into c^amp. 

During active service the various medical 
units required on mobilization are organized 
from the regimental peace establishment, sup- 
plemented by men from the reserve; the 
drivers coming from the cavalry reserve. 
These units are in addition to the regimental 
medical organization, and are as follows: 

To each infantry division in the field is at- 
tached what is called a "Sanitary Division

that forms a part of the divisional supply 
and transport column, and consists of a 
bearer company, a divisional ambulance hos- 
pital, and two "mobile" or field hospitals. 
In the case of sanitary divisions attached to 
active — as distinguished from reserve — in- 
fantry divisions, two extra "mobile" hos- 
pitals are included, making four in all for 
that division. The divisional sanitary organ- 
ization is intended for the establishment of a 
main dressing-station, and to otherwise col- 
lect and despatch the wounded from the 
fighting line to the field hospitals. The per- 
sonnel is made up of: One combatant officer 
commanding; five surgeons; one official — 
quartermaster; twenty-nine "feldshers," etc.; 
217 non-commissioned officers and men of 
the bearer company; thirty-nine non-com- 
missioned officers and men of the transport 
corps — a total of 292. Fifty stretchers, 2000 
bandages — divided into ten packages, — fifty 
first - aid knapsacks, two operating - tables, 
four dressing-tents, and the necessary medi- 
cines, stores, etc., constitute the equipment. 
For transport, eight four-horse ambulance 
wagons, three one-horse medical-stores carts, 
fifteen two-horse stores wagons, and one four- 
horse stores wagon — for heavier portions of 
material — are required.* 

With the Divisional Sanitary Train are 
twenty-four ambulance wagons, an equal 
number of stores wagons, six stretcher carts, 
and two medical-stores carts — each train 
carries 144 stretchers. 

The organization of the Bearer Companies 
is practically identical with that of other com- 
panies, and the uniform is the same as that of 
the first regiment of the division to which it 
belongs, and the number of the division is 
shown on the shoulder-loop. The brassard 
of the Geneva Convention is worn, and no 
arms are allowed except to drivers, each of 
whom carries a hatchet but is not allowed 
the brassard. 



* Longmore gives a somewhat different organiza- 
tion. His enumeration of the personnel of the Sani- 
tary Division for the field hospital — to accommo- 
date six officers and 160 men — is: Eight surgeons, 
sixteen dressers, fifty orderlies, and the necessary (?) 
officials; bearer company ©f- one commissioned 
officer, one sergeant-major, eight sergeants, and 200 
bearers; transport section, one officer and 108 
drivers — total, 393. 



The Divisional "Mobile" Field Hospitals 
constitute the third line of medical assistance, 
and each affords accommodation for ten offi- 
cers and two hundred men. Their role, loca- 
tion and movements are the same as in other 
armies. The, personnel of each hospital com- 
prises five surgeons, two other officials, 107 
non-commissioned officers and men— includ- 
ing twenty-eight for transport duties, — four 
"Sisters of Mercy," fifty-seven horses, and 
twenty-five wagons. The equipment in- 
cludes, besides bedding and clothing for ten 
officers and 200 men, three large tents — each 
to hold twenty men, — 210 bedsteads, 105 
tables, forty stretchers, and the necessary 
medical stores, etc. Transport requires nine- 
teen two-horse wagons, one four-horse wagon 
— for heavy parts of tents, — four one-horse 
stores carts, and one four-horse carriage for 
the "Sisters." The uniform of the personnel 
of these hospitals is the same as that of the 
fourth regiment of the divksion, with the 
number of the hospital on the shoulder-loop; 
the arms and use of the brassard are as de- 
scribed for the bearer company. During an 
engagement these hospitals are established 
somewhere in the rear of the line of battle; 
and, when necessary, in addition to the per- 
manent personnel, surgeons and dressers are 
detailed from the regiments in sufficient 
number to meet the requirements of any par- 
ticular emergency. The divisional ambulance 
hospital constitutes the dressing-station, which 
is located in the immediate rear of the fight- 
ing line, and its personnel is furnished by de- 
tail from the regimental surgeons and the 
bearer company.* 

The Reserve Field Hospitals, of which 240 



* Longmore says that in European Russia these 
hospitals number eighty-four and are permanent 
formations. In time of war they follow a few 
marches in the rear of the army. Each field hospi- 
tal will accommodate thirty officers and 600 men, 
and can be divided into three equal sections. The 
personnel consists of one commandant (non-medical 
officer), one principal surgeon, nine surgeons, one 
apothecary, two compounders, and 304 non-com- 
missioned officers and men, of whom sixty-three 
belong to the transport service. Each hospital has 
a train of twenty-seven carriages, which may also 
be employed to transport the sick to the hospitals 
further in the rear. Both material and hospital 
stores, in time of peace, are kept in the Intendance 
depots. The personnel and horses are organized 
only during active service.

have no trans D, their .' and

geons, four i eighty feidshers, etc., 

and four Sisters of Mercy. Their organiza- 
s identical with that of the divisional 
field hospitals, except as to transport. 

Military Sanitary Convoys, twenty in 
number, are mobilized in time of war for the 
transport from the front to the rear of 
led and sick. The strength of each 
is: One combatant officer in command, two 
surgeons, ninety-eight non-commissioned 
officers and men — including seventy-one for 
transport work, — two Sisters of Mercy, 137 
horses, and thirty-six carriages— including 
twenty-seven four-horse ambulances, one 
four-horse kitchen wagon, seven two-horse 
stores wagons, and one one-horse medical- 
stores cart. 

The Field Dispensaries are intended to 
supply the divisional and field hospitals with 
the medical and surgical stores required. 
In time of war, seven of these dispensaries 
are mobilized, each being provided with a 
supply equal to the requirements of four 
months. Three officials and twenty-one 
non-commissioned officers and men consti- 
tute the personnel. Transport is provided 
when required.* 

There are seventeen Permanent Military 
Hospitals located in European Russia, eleven 
in the Caucasus, and six in Asia — divided 
into four classes. Class First provides 200 
beds, with one chief surgeon, four other sur- 
geons, four officials, one apothecary, eight 
feidshers, and seventy-six men of lower 
grades. Class Second has double the num- 
ber of beds, three additional surgeons, one 
additional official five additional feidshers, 
and 114 men of lower grades — otherwise 
duplicates the First Class. Class Third has 
650 beds, one chief surgeon, ten surgeons, 
eight officials, one apothecary, twenty feid- 
shers, and 152 men of lower grades. Class 
Four: 1 100 beds, one chief surgeon, eighteen

some of which follow the advance of the army, the 
others being distributed between the base and other 
points. 



surgeons, one combatant officer, ten officials, 
apothecary, thirty-three feidshers, and 
A lower grades. 

in Europe also there are about sixty Local 
Hospitals, ail equal number in Asia, and two- 
thirds as many in the Caucasus, varying in 
number of beds from fifty to 350, the person- 
nel of each consisting of from two to - 
surgeons, one to two apothecaries, one of 
— hospital supervisor, — three to eleven feid- 
shers, seven to twenty-seven of lower grades, 
and one nurse for each lot of eight patients. 

In every independent unit or command 
there is a Troop Hospital, opened only when 
no local or military hospital is available; or, 
instead of the troop hospital, may be opened 
in each command Receiving Rooms ol 
teen beds. The personnel in either instance 
is determined by the regulations governing 
the sanitary service as already described M In 
the Line," for each regiment, battery, etc. 

The Central Medical Depot is at St. Peters- 
burg, and nine other lesser depots are estab- 
lished at different points in the Empire; these 
are for the purchase, storage, and issuing of 
supplies. 

Longmore declares all temporary hospitals 
are under the orders of the Director-General, 
who is attached to the General Staff of the 
Army. Whether or not this official is a phy- 
sician, does not appear — probably not, inas- 
much as the author further adds that the 
Director-General is assisted in his duties by 
the chief surgeon as regards medical details, 
and that the personnel of the hospitals are 
under his orders, except the surgeons, who 
are, however, subordinate to him in matters 
of discipline and administration. 

It is a part of the duty of the Director- 
General, in active service, to see that all hos- 
pitals at the front are evacuated as rapidly 
as possible, and if the ordinary means of 
conveyance are insufficient for this purpose, 
recourse can be had to wagons of the Inten- 
dance or of the country in which operations 
are being carried on. It is also his duty to 
establish new field hospitals, and generally 
to control the supply and see to the efficiency

The present total of the Medical Depart- 
ment of the Russian Army does not materi- 
ally differ from that of 1886, which was: 
Surgeons, 2808; pharmacists, 232; medical 
feldshers, 3804; company (squadron, battery) 
feldshers, 3445 — which may be said to fairly 
represent the peace establishment. 

II. THE ARMY OF ITALY.* 

The Military Corps consists of: One Mili- 
tary Sanitary Inspectorate; twelve Military 
Sanitary Territorial Directorates; an indefi- 
nite number of Principal Military Hospital 
Directorates; Medical Officers; and twelve 
Sanitary Sections or Companies. 

The Military Sanitary Inspectorate is com- 
posed of one inspector-in-chief with the rank 
of surgeon major-general, two sanitary in- 
spectors ranking as surgeon major-generals 
or surgeon-colonels, one apothecary director, 
and one secretary. Each Territorial Direc- 
torate has one surgeon-colonel as director, 
one surgeon-lieutenant, one clerk, one orderly, 
and three attendants. The Principal Mili- 
tary Hospital Directorates are established, 
whenever necessary, by royal decree. 

The number of Medical Officers assigned 
to the different combatant organizations is as 
follows: Regiments of Alpini (three or four 
battalions), one surgeon-subaltern per bat- 
talion; regiments of infantry or rifles (three 
battalions), one surgeon-captain and two sur- 
geon-subalterns with regimental staff; regi- 
ments of cavalry (two battalions each), regi- 
ments of field artillery — corps or divisional — 
(two brigades), horse artillery regiments 
(three brigades and one train brigade), regi- 
ments of fortress artillery (three brigades 
and four brigades), regiments of engineers 
(seven brigades), each one surgeon-captain 
and one surgeon-subaltern, with regimental 
staff ;f regiments of mountain artillery (three 
brigades), each one surgeon-captain and two 
surgeon-lieutenants. 

Every regiment, and in case of the Alpini 
every battalion, has a corporal or lance-ser- 
geant as sanitary assistant, except regiments

officers. 



of mountain artillery — which have three. 
The officers of the sanitary department are 
graduates of the military medical school at 
Florence. 

Each Foot Sanitary Section consists of two 
surgeon-captains — mounted, — four surgeon- 
subalterns, one accountant-subaltern, one 
civilian (chaplain), one sergeant or first ser- 
geant, two sergeants or lance-sergeants, six 
lance-sergeants or corporals as sanitary as- 
sistants — three of whom are apothecaries, — 
three lance-sergeants as bearers, eight cor- 
poral bearers, three corporal sick-attendants, 
132 privates — bearers, — fourteen privates as 
sick-attendants, and eight officers' attendants. 
The Train of the Section has also one officer, 
twenty-five enlisted men, twenty-six horses, 
and four two- wheeled and eight four-wheeled 
vehicles. 

Each Mounted Sanitary Section has one 
surgeon-captain — mounted, — one surgeon- 
subaltern, one accountant-subaltern, one 
chaplain, one sergeant or first sergeant, one 
lance-sergeant, two sanitary assistants — 
lance-sergeants or corporals, and one an 
apothecary, — one corporal sick- attendant, 
one corporal bearer, four privates as sick- 
attendants, twenty privates as bearers, four 
officers' attendants, and a detachment of 
artillery train consisting of thirteen privates, 
fourteen horses, and two two-wheeled and 
four four-wheeled vehicles. 

The Sanitary (Hospital) Corps in active 
service is assigned as follows: One section to 
each infantry and cavalry division, and a 
headquarters or extra section to each corps 
de armee. The organized militia has likewise 
twelve sanitary sections. The uniform is 
similar to that of the infantry, except that 
the badge on the shako is a star with a Ge- 
neva cross; a white pompon is also worn with 
the number of the company upon it in red, 
and the Geneva badge app'ears again on the 
arm; the men carry side arms only. 

Preliminary estimates for the Italian Army, 
1894-1895, provide for the following sani- 
tary organization: Thirteen surgeon-colonels, 
twenty-six surgeon-lieutenant colonels, fifty- 
five surgeon-majors, 283 surgeon-captains, 
288 surgeon-lieutenants and second lieuten- 
ants* — total, 665; likewise twelve account-

Also there are in the neighborhood 
of one hundred apothecary officers, whose 
duties are chiefly in connection with the 
medicine supply depots. Before the law of 

vent into effect, which was enacted as 
a measure of economy rather than efficiency, 
the organization represented: Three surgeon 
major-generals, three field officers (medical), 
and three surgeon-captains — all mounted — as 
Inspectors of Military Sanitation; twelve 
field medical officers and twelve surgeon- 
captains, with thirty-six horses, representing 
the twelve ''District Directorates" (army 
corps); seventy-seven field medical officers, 
eighteen surgeon-captains, along with sev- 
enty-two lieutenants of the line, 103 ser- 
geants, 275 corporals, 1925 privates, and 172 
horses, attached to the hospitals and consti- 
tuting the twelve Medical Companies; four 
medical field officers, two surgeon-captains, 
with four lieutenants of the line, four ser- 
geants, two corporals, twenty-eight privates, 
and ten horses, representing the School of 
Application of Military Medicine, to which 
one surgeon-captain — mounted — and one 
lieutenant of the line were attached. To 
the First Legion Carbineers (cadets) — 115 
regiments infantry (Bessaglieri, Alpini) — 
were attached 108 surgeon - captains, 238 
lieutenants of the line, and 108 horses; 
eighty-seven mounted surgeon-captains were 
assigned to an equal number of Districts; two 
surgeon -captains — mounted— to the Discip- 
linary Company (Penitentiary); twenty-four 
surgeon - captains — mounted — and twenty- 
four lieutenants of the line to twenty-four 
regiments of Cavalry; thirty-one surgeon-

tenants of the line to thirty-one regiments of 
Artillery; four surgeon-captains — mounted — 



&gt;ur lieutenants of the line to four regi- 
ments of i eight surgeon-captains 
— mounted — and one lieutenant of the line 
to Invalid and Veterinary Schools and Col- 
The summary is: Three major-gen- 
erals, ninety-six field officers, 300 captains 
— medical officers, — 376 lieutenants, ic 
geants, 277 corporals, 2053 privates of the 
troops, and 492 horses. 

When the army is on war footing,* with 
the Intendance at the headquarters of an 
army in the field, there is an Army Sanitary 
Directorate organized as follows: One direc- 
tor surgeon-colonel and one surgeon lieuten- 
ant-colonel, four surgeon-captains, four sur- 
geon subalterns, one chief and three lesser 
apothecaries (civilians), two clerks, two offi- 
cers' orderlies, fifteen officers' servants — the 
three latter classes being enlisted men; like- 
wise eight horses. The train detachment is 
represented by one sergeant, one lance-ser- 
geant, five corporals (saddlers, etc ), twelve 
lance-corporals and privates, and twenty 
horses, with five vehicles of all kinds, includ- 
ing forage and ambulance wagons. Total, 
ten officers, thirty-eight enlisted men, four 
civilians, and twenty-eight horses. 

There are also fifteen Field Hospitals, cf 
200 beds each, attached to headquarters, the 
organization of each being as follows: One 
director — a surgeon-major or surgeon-cap- 
tain, — two surgeon-captains, four surgeon- 
subalterns, one accountant - subaltern, one 
apothecary, one chaplain, one first sergeant, 
two sergeants or lance-sergeants, five sanitary 
assistants (two of whom are apothecaries), 
two sick-attendants (corporals), two bearers 
(corporals), eighteen sick-attendants (lance- 
corporals and privates), twelve bearers (lance- 
corporals and privates), ten officers' atten- 
dants, and a Civilian Train of eleven men, 
twenty horses, one four-wheeledf and eight 
two-wheeled vehicles — a total of eight offi- 
cers, fifty-two enlisted men, thirteen civilians, 
and twenty-four horses. There are also field 
hospitals of 100 beds and mountain hospitals

of fifty beds, with a less numerous persotinel 
than just given. 

As a maximum, each army in the field has 
at its disposal four transport railway trains* 
for sick and wounded, organized as fol- 
lows: One surgeon-captain as train director, 
three surgeon-subalterns, two non-commis- 
sioned officers, five lance-sergeants or cor- 
porals as sanitary assistants, four officers' 
attendants, thirty-five privates; also one com- 
bination car, thirty-five cars for transport of 
wounded, one car for baggage, one car for 
transport of chests of clothing, equipage, 
hospital stores, etc. The composition of this 
train may be modified according to circum- 
stances. 

With the headquarters of the army corps 
there is a Corps Sanitary Directorate,! as 
follows: One surgeon- colonel or lieutenant- 
colonel as director, one surgeon-lieutenant, 
one clerk, one orderly, three officers' atten- 
dants, and two horses. 

With each corps, headquarters, and divi- 
sion of infantry, there is a Foot Sanitary 
Section, and with each cavalry division a 
Mounted Sanitary Section, the organizations 
of which have already been given. The per- 
sonal organization for each regiment is as 
follows: Infantry or rifles — One surgeon- 
captain — regimental staff, — six surgeon-sub- 
alterns — two to each battalion, — three sani- 
tary assistants— one to each battalion, — and 
twelve bearers — four to each battalion: 
Cavalry — One staff surgeon ranking as cap- 
tain, two surgeon-subalterns — one to each bat- 
talion, — and one corporal sanitary assistant: 
Horse or Field Artillery — One surgeon-sub- 
altern to each brigade: Mounted Batteries 
— Each one surgeon-subaltern, one corporal 
sanitary assistant, and two bearers. 

{To be continued?) 



*Cars for the transport of wounded are supplied 
with the necessary equipment, and each of them 
should be supplied with eight litters; 280 wounded 
may thus be carried. The personnel of the trans- 
port trains is ordinarily drawn from the territorial 
militia, and is attached, in accordance with orders 
from the Minister of War, to the Army Directorate. 

fThe baggage, etc., of the Army Corps Sanitary 
Directorate is carried in one of the wagons of the 
staff of the corps, or else in the wagons of the Sani- 
tary Sections attached, according to orders received 
from the chief of staff of the corps. 



A CONSIDERATION OF SCORBUTIC MANI- 
FESTATIONS IN THE YOUNG 
SUBJECT.* 

BY JOHN C. WISE, M.D., U. S. NAVY. 

While scorbutus has declined in importance 
as a disease incident to sea life and to armies, 
it would seem that changing physiological 
and economic conditions may cause it to be 
dreaded on land, as it has hitherto been on 
the sea. 

A most interesting feature in this connec- 
tion is the close resemblance of this disease 
— as seen in the young — to rachitis, and there 
can be no doubt that many cases have been 
considered and treated erroneously. 

Not only can scorbutus become engrafted 
on a rachitic stock, but the causal agencies 
of these diseases are not remote, both arising 
from deprivation of those proximate prin- 
ciples and elements which are requisite to 
normal histogenesis. 

Furthermore, the clinical histories of these 
maladies can be paralleled, and until recent 
years German writers have insisted that the 
so-called "infantile scorbutus" was but acute 
rickets. This contention was undoubtedly 
founded on insufficient "post-mortem" evi- 
dence, and is no longer held. What made 
the view more plausible was the fact before 
noted — that the scorbutic condition is so 
often engrafted on rachitic stock, — and the 
same decided bone symptoms and the same 
pseudo-paralysis exist in both diseases. 

Let us review the history of the differentia- 
tion of these maladies. Twenty-two years 
ago the Swedish Doctor Ingerslev pointed 
out radical differences between the two af- 
fections, though admitting their similarity in 
some respects. At this time the Germans 
based their belief in the non-existence of 
scorbutus in infants on the fact that no 
sponginess of the infantile gums had been 
discovered. In 1880 Doctor Kuhn reported 
an epidemic of scorbutus at Moringen; thir- 
teen cases were recorded of infants, suckled 
by mothers who were at the time scorbutic. 
Heubner of Leipsic, and Rhein of Frankfort, 
made able researches, and the subject was 
taken up in America by Northrup, who re- 
ported four autopsies; later (in 1S91) Starr,

Holt and oth&lt; rted iii cases to the 

New York Academy i ne. In Kng- 

land, Cherdle (in 1879) confirmed the obser- 

ind definitely fixed the 

of this disease; and while there have 

many other workers along this line in 

that country, it remained to Professor Barlow 

tablish the most important post-mortem 

In an extensive series of cases, 

confirming the work already done by Doctor 

N thrnp in this country. 

The protean feature of this disease is hem- 
orrhage. Spoliation of the blood is carried 
to such an extent that hydremia is estab- 
lished, involving effusions into most of the 
organic tissues, the favorite seat being sub- 
periosteal; and it is these conditions, so es- 
sential to the scorbutic state, which have 
established the identity of the disease. r l nus, 
while the usual seat of the haemorrhage is be- 
neath the periosteum, it has also been re- 
ported as occurring in the nose, intestine, 
urine, muscles, medulla of the bones, pleura, 
spleen, and gums. In Professor Barlow's 
cases a sheath of blood was found about the 
femur, and serous extravasation in the fem- 
oral muscles — with blood clots in some in- 
stances, — and the same changes were observed 
in the tibiae and scapulas, while the humeri 
showed spongioid ossification with extensive 
medullary haemorrhage; in the ribs the peri- 
osteum was detached, and a chocolate-col- 
ored debris was found between it and the 
bone. The joints are not the seat of haemor- 
rhage, and the visceral extravasations are 
slight. Under the microscope, it was found 
that the trabecular structure of the bone was 
in great measure absorbed; and it may be 
here noted that the minute pathology of 
scorbutus as observed by Bristow is at vari- 
ance with that of rachitis as studied by 
Virchow and Kolliker. 

Scorbutus attacks infants, as a rule, before 
the end of the first year of life. We notice, 
as to flesh, no great loss, but the pallor is 
extreme, marked by muddiness of the skin; 
later the little patient, hitherto mentally ac- 
tive, becomes apathetic or irritable; muscular 
activity ceases; the lower limbs become 
flexed, and efforts to extend them provoke 
piteous cries of pain. Swelling of the limbs, 
usually symmetrical, soon follows; at first 



undecided, it to deformity — the 

favorite seats of this symptom are the P 
the epiphyseal junctions of the ankles 
the thighs, the swelling at the ankles extendi 
ing upon and involving the tibiae to a greater 
or less extent. When the child is Ik 
the lap, the limbs hang in a helpless fashion, 
with feet everted, very suggestive of paraly- 
sis. Instead of sitting, the patient now re- 
clines, and no longer uses the lower limbs, 
though previously able to walk. There is 
intense irritability and pain of the affected 
parts, due doubtless to two causes — pressure 
on the nerves, and anemia. 

In cases somewhat advanced, a character- 
istic occurrence is haemorrhage into the orbit; 
unless aware of the true nature of the disease, 
we are apt to believe we are dealing with a 
catarrhal condition; the lids swell, but there 
is little discharge, and no relief is afforded 
by treatment which is usually successful in 
catarrh. Some ecchymosis of the lids is 
noted, and the eye looks protuberant— which 
is in reality the case, it being displaced by 
haemorrhage beneath the orbital periosteum. 
This displacement is an obstinate condition, 
and exists in a case under the writer's care, 
four months after disappearance of other 
symptoms. 

If dentition is in progress, it is delayed, or 
the teeth are black and corrugated when 
they appear. The gums are very vascular 
and bleed easily; soon sponginess is marked, 
and fleshy growths protrude about the erupt- 
ing teeth; sometimes the teeth are covered 
in by the swollen gum as if by a hood. All 
of which is accompanied by a most foetid 
condition of the breath. 

The digestive symptoms are markedly in 
contrast with those of rachitis. The appetite 
is good — an effort apparently to make up in 
quantity what is lacking in quality. 

Diarrhoea does not exist, as in rachitis, 
unless cod-liver oil is being given, and even 
then it may be absent, the oil only serving, 
by its malassimilation and decomposition, to 
give a foul odor to the alvine discharges. 

The urine is diminished, has a strong odor, 
is sometimes albuminous; hematuria, though 
noticed in some cases, is not a common symp- 
tom. 

The temperature is elevated from one to 






THE MEDICAL AGE. 






two-and-a-half degrees, and has slight di- 
urnal variations. A prominent symptom is 
sweating of the head, just as in rachitis. 

If after the lapse of a month or two the 
true nature of the case is not determined 
and appropriate treatment instituted, emacia- 
tion sets in, and we detect the osseous swell- 
ing about the femur and tibia more distinctly. 
If, on the other hand, the disease is to give 
way to improved diet and treatment, the sub- 
sidence of swelling at once commences, pro- 
gressing rapidly, the bony formations are 
absorbed, deformity disappears, and motion 
is slowly restored. 

The conditions under which scorbutus and 
rachitis arise are instructive. From time 
immemorial, and with setiological accuracy, 
rachitis has been looked upon as a disease 
of the poor, the illy fed, clad, and housed. 
Scorbutus in the young, on the other hand, 
is found in the homes of the affluent oftener 
than in those of the indigent. This is due in 
greatest measure to the extensive use, among 
the better classes, of proprietary foods — 
which are beyond the reach of the poor. 

While we are aware of the conditions which 
produce rachitis and scorbutus, we cannot 
say what particular chemical substance it is 
that prevents the development of either of 
these morbid states; it is neither citric nor 
malic nor tartaric acid, nor the alkaline 
bases, nor yet their combination; but we 
know that these substances abound in the 
juice of oranges, lemons, and fresh vegeta- 
bles. The exact cause is still a question 
awaiting solution by biologic chemistry. 
Garrod has demonstrated a deficient alka- 
linity in scorbutic blood, and we know that 
malates, tartrates and citrates are convertible 
in the blood into alkaline carbonates; beyond 
all this there lie histogenetic changes, which 
. we do not comprehend. But the fact remains 
that the nearer we approach Nature's formulae, 
the safer is the diet for the young — uncooked 
meats, and milk, are more antiscorbutic than 
the cooked. 

While infantile scorbutus has been ob- 
served in children at the breast, these cases 
are reported from abroad, where the dietary 
of the lower classes is so often deficient. In 
the vast majority of cases the infant has been 
deprived of its natural aliment, breast-milk, 
and some of the proprietary foods have been 



substituted. We know that, however closely 
these preparations approach the analytical 
composition of human milk, and however 
plausible their claims on theoretical grounds, 
as a true physiological dietary they are prac- 
tically failures. The infant's food is a natu- 
ral product, and if it must be changed we 
naturally would substitute the milk of some 
allied mammal; and thus the best substitute 
for human milk is cows' milk. 

Briefly, in conclusion, let me call attention 
to the practical therapeutic benefit to be de- 
rived from the researches in this field which 
have been mentioned. To those who doubt 
the differentiation of the two diseases, treat- 
ment may assume the character of a control 
experiment. 

If, in a case of scorbutus which has been 
treated as rachitis, we dispense with the 
chalybeate and the lime syrups — which after 
all are but adjuncts to a proper diet — and 
use pure cows' milk, sparingly diluted with 
lime-water and scalded (this much we must 
concede to sterilization); if we permit some 
article of the much abused starch group in 
the dietary, preferably baked potato, finely 
sieved; and last, but not least, if we allow 
orange-juice, not by the teaspoonful, but 
sweet oranges ad libitum, — if these things 
be done, a change most gratifying will be at 
once manifested. In the writer's cases it has 
been the most complete he has ever known 
in medicine. As to cod-liver oil, it may or 
may not be superadded; a good criterion will 
be to watch the bowels in reference to its as- 
similation; as a rule it is unnecessary.

NEUROLOGY OF THE FEMALE 
DUCTIVE ORGANS.* 



REPRO- 



BY M. R. MITCHELL, M.D. 

The nerve supply of the uterus and its ap- 
pendages is derived from two great systems, 
viz.: the nerves of animal life, through the 
internal sacral nerves; and the great sympa- 
thetic, through the inferior hypogastric plex- 
uses. The spinal nerves supply the sphincter 
fibres of the cervix uteri chiefly, and the

fact that if • 

all t: with it. In the process of 

•ion the ova:\ - . Sted, and it 

jrmpathizers in the tubes and uterus. 

The chi&lt; ietermming cause 

ot' labor is traceable to the direct pressure of 
the uterine contents upon the sphincter fibres 
of the mouth of the womb, occasioning an 
irritation which is reflected to the uterine 
..'.sing contraction and expulsive 
effort. This same retlex influence, put forth 
by the sympathetic nerve system, clearly ac- 
counts for a striking physiological intimacy 
and a pathological affinity between the utero- 
ovarian and other structures of the body. 
Morning sickness, anorexia, and the various 
forms of morbid appetite can be explained 
best, perhaps, by the reflex action of a copi- 
ous network of the sympathetic innervation 
of the utero-ovarian apparatus and that of 
the stomach. Gueniot, in speaking of vomit- 
ing in pregnancy, says: "A morbid or abnor- 
mal state, the nervous system as the carrier 
of reflex action, and the stomach, are the 
three prime factors in this malady." He 
therefore urges that any abnormality of 
uterus or appendages, whether ulcers, ex- 
coriations, flexures, or of a specific nature, 
should be corrected, and that the nervous 
system, particularly the spinal nervous cen- 
tres, should receive attention. 

The pathological aspect of my theme as- 
sumes an attitude of startling importance 
when is called to mind how frequently the 
practitioner is foiled in the attainment of a 
satisfactory aetiological explanation of the 
existence of some new affection in a distal 
organ, or perhaps the sudden development 
of some latent malady. Pozzi says: 

There is no function upon which uterine disease 
reflects more constantly than the digestive, and 
ignorance of this fact may cause grave errors in 
diagnosis. . . Dilatation of the stomach is 

very common in metritis of long duration. These 
patientc suffer from a loss of appetite, nausea, and 
a form of flatulence which occurs as a chronic 
tympanites, so that the abdominal enlargement 
interferes with palpation and bimanual explora- 
tion. . Women who suffer with metritis or 
displacement, sometimes experience a dry cough, 
without any disease of the respiratory organs. 



Among the long list of cutaneous afiec- 
. many are disappointing afl ;ology 

until one is led to look for a nervous intlu- 
that in turn directs attention to an in- 
flammation or some derangement connected 
with the uterus or its appendages; and the 
practitioner will often be equally chagrined 
the relief of those dermopathies until 
the primary malady affecting the sexual 
organs is relieved. 

Who has not observed the sudden d 
pearance of an acne, coincidental with pu- 
berty or the menopause, when the function 
of ovulation is slow in becoming established, 
and when the menses are irregular or delayed ? 
This eruption seems to be mainly along the 
expansion of the trifacial, which is accom- 
panied by filaments from the sympathetic. A 
girl of fourteen or sixteen presents herself, 
possessing many of the charms of beauty, 
yet on account of a pimply face is really re- 
pulsive; and the relief of the same is often 
postponed until her womanly functions have 
been made to attain normal activity. 

In a thesis published in 1886, M. Tourneux 
expresses an opinion that menstruation causes 
various cutaneous eruptions which serve as a 
nidus for a streptococcus. Professor Hardy 
applies the term "pemphigus" to a bulbous 
eruption of successive appearance, extending 
over several months, and appearing only in 
young girls between fourteen and twenty, in 
whom menstruation had been interrupted: 
he likewise considers suppression of the 
menses as one of the most frequent causes 
of erythema nodosum. A case is reported 
by Alibert, "of a young lady aged twenty- 
four who was attacked with a general scaly 
eruption following suppression of the menses 
caused by fright." Pruritus vulvae with 
eczema is a frequent complication of the 
climacteric. 

Scanzoni affirms that "anaemic women who 
have at the same time some affection of the 
genital organs very often present various 
eruptions on the skin, especially when there 
occurs an intercurrent exacerbation of the 
uterine trouble; these eruptions are chronic 
eczema, acne rosacea, erythematous erup- 
tions, urticaria, as well as a furuncular dia- 
thesis." 

Occasionally one observes general nervous 
manifestations such as hysteria, chorea, and

insanity, impossible to trace to any other than 
a utero-reflex origin. 

A girl of seventeen, otherwise healthy # and 
strong, was affected with a severe form of 
dysmenorrhea, complicated with hysterical 
convulsions at each menstrual period; a cer- 
vical stenosis was relieved, menstruation be- 
came normal, and the convulsive attacks were 
no longer experienced. 

Two young women, during primiparous 
pregnancies, were affected with marked cho- 
reic symptoms. One was relieved in a few 
weeks under the administration of arsenic 
bromide; in her second pregnancy she was 
not affected by this nervous lesion. The 
second case was only partially relieved 
under the use of the remedy; however, 
after normal full-time confinement, no fur- 
ther chorea was experienced until she was 
about three months gone in her second preg- 
nancy, when she was again attacked with 
chorea and convulsions, resulting in miscar- 
riage. — Both of these cases, according to the 
history obtained, were of a distinctively ner- 
vous temperament. 

Parvin refers to a discussion of this subject 
in the London Obstetrical Society, in which 
Doctor Herman declared he believed "in the 
connection between chorea and pregnancy, 
and that the majority of such cases were 
benefited by the induction of abortion or of 
premature labor." Parvin also refers to two 
other cases, reported by Jones, of chorea com- 
plicating pregnancy — one at seven months, 
which ceased after the induction of prema- 
ture labor, the foetus being decomposed; the 
other with delirium, and paralysis of the left 
arm, with recovery after confinement. 

Functional aberrations of the sensorial and 
intellectual faculties are often observed in 
pregnant women. Such disorders of the intel- 
lect sometimes proceed even to insanity. I 
recall three cases of partial insanity occur- 
ring near the end of gestation, and all ap- 
peared to be relieved of the positive indica- 
tions after confinement. The history of the 
three seemed to show they were of excitable, 
nervous, and irritable dispositions; two had 
convulsions previous to labor, and one had 
served a term in the insane asylum. 

In a majority of these cases there is no 
doubt of a latent predisposition to nervous 
or mental derangement; and the predispos- 



ing quality is excited to outward manifes- 
tation through the reflex influence of pelvic 
irritation. Paralysis is a neurotic compli- 
cation occasionally affecting the pregnant 
woman. 

A lady, six months pregnant, came under 
my care two years ago afflicted with motor 
paralysis of the lingual muscles which are 
supplied by branches of the fifth pair of 
nerves; there seemed to be no other compli- 
cation. Vocal articulation was almost im- 
possible, and continued so until the end of 
gestation, when it began to improve slowly, 
but she did not entirely recover until six 
months afterward. 

Neurotic disturbances in the form of neu- 
ralgias of the face, of the intercostal region, 
and of the thighs, are clearly traceable to 
different forms of metritis. When such slight 
ailments as cicatrices of the cervix, for in- 
stance Emmet's "cicatricial plug," are re- 
moved, relief from a distal neurosis may 
follow. 

In a study of neurotic disturbances re- 
flected from the sexual organs, one cannot 
fail to observe the striking analogy between 
the manifestations connected with the men- 
strual functions in the young girl and those 
in the pregnant woman. Thus far I have 
called attention to the reflex display of nerve 
function pertaining to the female generative 
organs, but I will now refer to an exhibition 
of more direct nerve disturbance in this lo- 
cality, viz., pains of child-birth; for much 
has been said and written as to the baneful 
influences of our modern civilization upon the 
parturient woman, and there are those who 
venture to assert that if such were corrected, 
parturition would become painless. 

The customs and methods of dress, im- 
proper and insufficient nutrition and physi- 
cal exercise, improperly ventilated sleeping- 
apartments, injudicious and unwise marriages, 
and excesses of various kinds, undoubtedly 
have done and are doing much to intensify 
the sorrows and sufferings of child-bearing. 
Reference is often made to the uncivilized 
races, where women are supposed to be 
less perverted as to physical development, 
and to this is attributed the supposed lack of 
suffering in connection with the parturient 
process, and the fact that child-birth is 
regarded by them with so little apparent 






THE MEDIi.AL AGE. 



apprehen- ict is, however, that the 

information generally obtainable in regard to 
e real extent of their 
suffering, - ry reliable. It is an ambi- 

tion amoi • nations to develop si 

endurano ering and danger, and it is 

certain that whatever degree of diminution 
..n in parturition the women of these 
barbarous races do experience as compared 
with their more cultured sisters is owing not 
entirely to the absence of customs that pre- 
vail in refined and civilized life, but to the 
deteriorating influences that obtain among the 
uncivilized; the tendency of savage modes of 
life is to impair the development of the 
nervous system; the nerve sensibilities are 
blunted, and the perception of pain is obtuse. 
Finally, those most competent to speak de- 
clare labor among savage women is very far 
from being a painless effort; and no one who 
has witnessed the throes of parturition in 
mares, dogs, cats, and other animals, can be 
convinced the act is here painless, though 
the assumption that it is is often cited to prove 
that the bearing of children should be devoid 
of suffering. 

It is probable, however, that the highly 
cultured, refined and physically developed 
woman possesses a high grade of nerve 
structure, with functions of acute sensibility 
that enhance her keen perception of pain. 
The sufferings of parturition are mainly in- 
duced by compression of the uterine nerves 
by the contraction of the muscular fibres, 
an act that means a disturbance of the integ- 
rity of the nerve structures. 

And now, although much of the suffering 
and danger in child-birth may be accounted 
for by a lack of the requisite physical culture 
and development— lack of tone, — by unwhole- 
some food and drink, and by the deteriorating 
fashions of dress and society, yet with an 
equilibrium of the fullest development of all 
the powers of a true womanhood, the only 
logical and physiological conclusion is that 
normal labor, in a normal womanhood, will be, 
in every case, attended with more or less of 
suffering — that "painless labor" is a myth, a 
delusion, the fruit of intellectual fancy, and 
not infrequently the keynote of the grossest 
quackery.

PARAPLEQM I OLLOWING TYPHOID 
i EVER. 

r.v N Dl M1AI.I, M.I&gt;. 

Miss A — | age, had always 

enjoyed fairly good health. A few years 
previous to her present illness she was thrown 
from a horse, but sustained no perm., 
injury. Her father died at the age of 67 of 
some form of paralysis, and her mother at the 
age of 59 of Hright's disease. I first saw her 
October 10th, 1X94, and obtained a history of 
malaise, fever, and frontal headache, of ten 
days' duration. Her temperature was 102 , 
and pulse rate about 90. 

After watching the patient a few days, 
typhoid fever was diagnosed. No unusual 
symptoms developed in the progress of the 
malady for some days; the temperature va- 
ried from 99 in the morning to 104' in the 
evening, reaching the latter figure but once; 
bowels were easily affected, a small dose of 
Rochelle salts producing several evacuations; 
no delirium, but some despondency and rest- 
lessness. On the 19th and 20th the temper- 
ature was normal and she seemed to be doing 
well; complained only of weakness; and I 
congratulated all concerned upon what prom- 
ised to be a speedy and happy termination of 
the malady. On the 22d found the temper- 
ature still normal, but she declared she was 
becoming weaker — that she could scarcely 
move her lower limbs. Upon closer examina- 
tion I ascertained that she had some pain in 
the back of the neck, that her tongue felt 
thick, that she had some difficulty in swallow- 
ing, and that her speech was altered. On the 
23d all these symptoms were exaggerated, 
and the right hand was partially drawn and 
weakened; further, she was unable to move 
her lower limbs. The patellar tendon reflex 
was absent, but sensation remained, and she 
retained control of bladder and rectum. At 
no time was her mind impaired. On the 24th 
the feverreturned and pulse began to quicken. 
Under the influence of heart and nerve tonics 
and stimulants such as strychnine, nitro- 
glycerin and electricity, her symptoms be- 
came better except for the paraplegia and 
gradual failure of heart's action. The pulse 
rate varied from 140 to 180 per minute for the 
next five or six days, and on the night of 
October 30th she died. 

Paraplegia, as a complication or a sequel 
of typhoid fever, is not a common affection. 
Neither of the two practitioners who were 
consultants in the case had ever had a like 
experience, and one, a most prominent mem- 
ber of the profession in North Texas, re- 
marked that in an active practice of twenty- 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 






five years he had never even heard or read 
of a similar case. 

In examining the literature of nervous 
complications of typhoid fever, I find most 
writers are silent regarding paraplegia as a 
complication or a sequel of this malady; a 
few, however, barely mention it, and a few 
give it some slight notice, Nothnagel alone 
giving it decided prominence. The rule is 
that the paralysis comes on about the end 
of the second or beginning of the third 
week of the fever, as was the case with 
Miss A , or else it comes on during con- 
valescence. Hawkins, of London, collected 
from various sources sixteen cases of hemi- 
plegia, mostly of the right side, occurring 
in the course of typhoid fever, and be- 
lieves the condition to be the sequel to a 
non-valvular lesion of the heart leading to 
the formation of thrombi in the left auricle, 
whence emboli are detached and carried to 
and lodged in a cerebral artery. — Soft, dark 
clots have been found in the cerebral arteries 
on autopsy. 

In my opinion, such was not the cause of 
the paralysis in this particular case, for the 
paralysis was progressive, the mind remained 
clear, the eyes were not affected, speech was 
but slightly altered, and it was paraplegia 
rather than hemiplegia. 

The true pathological condition or morbid 
anatomy of the case cannot, of course, be 
stated with any degree of positiveness, since 
no autopsy was held, but I incline to the be- 
lief that there was a myelitis, the anterior 
horn of gray matter being affected; that this 
was brought about by a toxaemia induced by 
the typhoid; that retained effete material 
brought about changes in the nutrition of 
the nerve centres, interfering with their nor- 
mal physiological functions — in other words, 
there was anaemia of some of the nerve cen-' 
tres. It is quite probable also that there 
was hereditary tendency to neurotic disease, 
as her father died of some form of paralysis.

SUPPRESSION OF URINE FOR FORTY- 
EIGHT DAYS. 

BY E. N. RININGER, M.D. 

Was called January 18th, 1895, to see a 
young, intelligent lady aged 18, light com- 



plexion, tall and well developed, apparently 
a model of health; had always been healthy 
and strong, except for an attack of enteric 
fever the previous autumn. Five weeks 
prior to my visit she ceased urinating, but 
had no other noticeable symptoms; on sec- 
ond day, parents were somewhat alarmed 
and called in the family physician, who re- 
mained in attendance until the state of his 
health compelled him to temporarily with- 
draw from practice. 

During those five weeks there had been no 
elevation of temperature; appetite and diges- 
tion normal; also normal condition of bowels, 
circulation, respiration, etc. — indeed, there 
was nothing abnormal save the suppression 
of urine alone, and a tender spot the size of 
the hand over the region of each kidney. 

The whole category of diuretics was ex- 
hausted, with no effect whatever; then, 
fearing uraemic poisoning, her physician re- 
sorted to diaphoresis (on the fourth day) 
and kept it up regularly, employing even the 
steam bath. Sweating was easily brought on 
and was always profuse, and an odor of urea 
was claimed to have been noticed on such 
occasions. This treatment was continued up 
to the time I was called, every symptom in 
the meantime being closely watched day and 
night, and the bladder carefully palpated by 
the physician at each visit. 

I found the patient as described, in a semi- 
recumbent posture, talking and laughing with 
callers. A close physical examination de- 
tected nothing abnormal but the extreme 
tenderness in the lumbar region. At every 
visit made by me the bladder was palpated 
carefully, but it was never found distended. 

Since the suppression came on so suddenly, 
with no premonitory symptoms, I was led to 
believe the circulation of the kidney was shut 
off by some form of paralysis or acute urinary 
congestion; in which case diuretics would 
have no effect, since they could not reach the 
kidney, the blood-supply being cut off. I 
advised the use of electricity, but continued 
the treatment instituted by my predecessor. 
There was some opposition to electricity on 
the part of the family, and a physician from 
a neighboring village who was called in dur- 
ing my absence declared it was liable to kill 
the patient. 

Visited patient every other day to watch for 
any untoward symptoms, being afraid of ure- 
mic poisoning. 

The family physician's treatment was kept 
up till January 26th, on which day I took 
with me a Faradic battery, explained fully 
my object in using it, and assured the family 
there would be no bad effects. Patient could 
feel electricity on every part of body except

and found the patient suffering greatly with 
it she termed "cramp." I speedily discov- 
ered there was marked distention of bladder; 
patient had tried to urinate, but found it 
impossible. I employed catheter and drew 
nearly two quarts of urine. Continued bat- 
tery and strychnine, ordering in addition a 

-poonful every three hours of the follow- 

mixture: Fluid extract corn-silk, two 

ounces; fluid extract henbane, thirty minims; 

acetate of potash, 150 grains; water, to make 

four ounces. 

January 31st. At noon was again com- 
pelled to use catheter, and secured about the 
same amount of urine as before; that which 
first passed was perfectly transparent, of light 
amber color, slightly acid reaction, specific 
gravity 1.004, and no abnormal constituents 
so far as could be discovered. 

Continued treatment as before for two 
weeks longer, during which time and up to 
present writing the patient has urinated from 
two to five times each day, the secretion be- 
ing normal in every respect. There was a 
slight cystitis, however, for one week. Patient 
has been in perfect health ever since the mid- 
dle of February. 

M. Herman, a pupil of Ludwig, has shown 
that if the pressure in the uriniferous tubules 
be increased by anything interfering with the 
free exit of urine, a decrease in the amount 
secreted in a given unit of time occurs, and 
at the same time there is a marked decrease 
in the elimination of the solid constituents, 
especially of urea. As the pressure increases, 
secretion becomes less and less active till a 
point is reached where it is entirely sup- 
pressed. The capillaries and uriniferous 
tubules are arranged in alternate bundles, so 
that the distention of one set of vessels i 
causes compression of the other; and it can 
be easily seen that when the uriniferous 
tubules are widely distended by a damming- 
up of their contents, they exert such a pres- 
sure on the blood-vessels as to materially 
interfere with the circulation, and diminished 
secretion results. 



The secretion of a large amount of clear 
after the sudden removal of an obstruc- 
tion which has persisted for some time, may 
plained by the fact that the vessels of 
the part then undergo dilatation which may 
not immediately subside; so in the kidneys 
this secondary dilatation allows the blood to 
flow with increased rapidity, and we have in- 
creased secretion in consequence — as in the 
case just given. 

Whether this case of suppression was 
to a damming-up of urine in the uriniferous 
tubules, some form of paralysis, or something 
else, I am not prepared to say; but I believe 
it was due to urinary congestion. What 
caused this congestion, I leave for some one 
else to answer.

A PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY EXPLAINED. 

Editor Medical Age: 

Whenever The Medical Age comes to 
my exchange table it is always thoroughly 
read. Hence, the interesting article in your 
number for July 25th, entitled "A Psycho- 
logical Mystery," did not escape. I am in- 
clined to reply to this by calling attention to 
a case somewhat similar, related to me by an 
assistant while teaching in the University of 
Michigan. This assistant related how a cer- 
tain house in his native city had been unoc- 
cupied for three or four years because it was 
regularly visited by a ghost. The property 
was a most valuable one, yet it had deterio- 
rated until it was practically unsalable, while 
no one would think for a moment of renting 
it. As this property was the sole residue of 
an estate supposed to be sufficient to support 
the heirs, some young ladies, the question 
became serious in more ways than one. 
Family after family sneered at the "ghost," 
but after spending a night or two in the 
house were only too glad to get away. My 
assistant was a daring young man, well ac- 
quainted with these young ladies, and inter- 
ested in restoring to them their property; 
therefore, he and two associates armed them- 
selves with knives and pistols and proposed 
to see what there was material about the 
"ghost." 

Their experience in the "haunted house" 
was somewhat thrilling. I will not attempt 
to give it in detail, but will only say that

after all three had fallen asleep, one was 
awakened by the noise of footsteps on the 
stairs, that could be distinctly heard for some 
time; suddenly the door of their room opened 
and a figure in white approached the foot of 
the bed, and, with arms outstretched, motions 
were made to the thoroughly affrighted par- 
ties. As the light of the moon entered the 
room, and a good view of the deathly face 
was obtained, two of the parties jumped out 
of the window, alighting on the roof of a shed 
one story below. My assistant admitted he 
was too frightened to jump, or he would 
have followed. Then the figure in white re- 
treated, and slowly wended its way down the 
stairs. Now was the time to act. Grasping 
his pistol, which was beneath the pillow, my 
assistant jumped to the head of the stairs 
and fired rapidly at the figure which was be- 
low. A series of most unearthly yells fol- 
lowed; the whole neighborhood was aroused; 
and the bleeding form was carried into an 
adjoining house and medical attendants 
promptly summoned. The white figure had 
been shot once through the calf of the leg. 
A confession followed, in which the young 
man who personated the ghost admitted the 
ghost act was a scheme to ruin this property 
because one of the young ladies had refused 
his offer of marriage. My assistant, in spite 
of the satisfactory results attained, declared 
it was weeks before he could eat a good meal 
or dared to go out alone after dark. 

In reading your article over, there is a sus- 
picion which crosses my mind that the person 
who used the uncanny phrase, "girl and 
woman, nigh onto fifty years," might know 
more even than she told; while the whole 
circumstance itself is no stronger proof of the 
presence of a ghost than the one my assistant 
related. 

Very truly yours,

NUCLEIN IN ACUTE PNEUMONIA. 

Editor Medical Age: 

Saturday, October 20th, 1S94, called to see 
Mr. B , who was suffering from pneumo- 
nia of the lower lobe of the left lung, in the 
first stage; pulse no; temperature 104 . 

On the Wednesday following, the upper 
lobe became involved; about the same time 
the right lung was attacked with bronchitis; 
temperature 105 ; pulse 120; respiration 30. 
The succeeding Friday the patient was deli- 
rious, and evidently in a dangerous condition; 
the cough was almost constant: expectora- 
tion frothy and viscid, not rusty; consolidation 



of left lung complete; pulse feeble and 120; 
temperature 105". I now regarded the case 
as hopeless. The left lung had been consol- 
idated eight days, and the right had become 
involved, in the larger bronchi at least, and 
there were no apparent signs of resolution. 

At my request, Messrs. Parke, Davis &amp; 
Company placed at my service a liberal sup- 
ply of Vaughan's Nuclein, and I commenced 
its use the following day (Saturday) by a dose 
of fifteen minims subcutaneously at 9 a.m., 
and repeated at 5.30 p.m. 

Sunday morning there was a marked im- 
provement in the bronchitis (of the right 
lung); expectoration less viscid and more 
profuse. Gave one drachm Nuclein hypo- 
dermatically morning and evening. Evening 
temperature normal; pulse 100; mind clear. 
No marked change in left lung. 

Monday I found the patient sitting up, and 
he remarked: "I have no more use for you." 
On examination I found the respiratory 
movements had returned sufficiently strong 
to be readily noticed; the bronchitis of the 
right lung had disappeared, and the left was 
clearing. Tuesday the patient was up, sit- 
ting by the stove; pulse 80; temperature 
normal. Wednesday gave the last dose of 
Nuclein. Thursday, patient dressed and 
walking about. Saturday I pronounced him 
well, and discontinued my visits. 

It is interesting to note the Nuclein was 
commenced at a time when there was the 
most danger — temperature 105 , pulse 130, 
and delirium. The improvement was simul- 
taneous with the use of the medicament ! If 
the Nuclein did not assist in this process, it 
certainly did no harm. After resolution was 
fully established the Nuclein had no effect 
upon temperature or pulse. 

Doctor Vaughan has proved by experiment 
on animals* that: "Rabbits and guinea-pigs 
may be protected against virulent cultures 
of the diplococcus of pneumonia by previous 
treatment with hypodermatic injections of a 
solution of yeast Nuclein; that the immunity 
thus secured is not due to the action of the 
Nuclein as a germicide directly; the process 
of securing this immunity is an educational 
one and most probably depends upon the 
stimulating effect of the Nuclein upon some 
organ whose function it is to protect the 
body against bacterial invasion. This pro- 
cess can be explained by the fact the sub- 
cutaneous injections of Nuclein increase the 
number of white blood-corpuscles." 

The researches of Metschnikoff. Kossel 
and others prove that the polynuclear white

PHOSPHATE OF LIHE IN THE PLACENTA. DETROIT, MICH . SEPTEMBER 10th, 1895. 



Bdiicr Medicjj ' 

Mrs. W , primipara, was confined with- 
out peculiar incident. The placenta on the 
maternal side felt rough by reason of numer- 
ous concretions of phosphate of lime the size 
of a small shot. Three cotyledons seemed 
composed of this material imbedded in a 
fibrinous stroma — one was excavated on the 
maternal aspect, leaving a cavity incased by 
this concretion. 

The child appears healthy, also the mother. 
I removed one cotyledon, and, after immers- 
ing in alcohol twenty-four hours, cut sections 
for the microscope and examined both in 
natural state and after staining; also sub- 
mitted a portion to the action of nitric acid. 
All the examinations confirmed the above 
expressed opinion of this anomalous struc- 
ture. 

This is the first time during thirty-five 
years of practice that I have seen such a 
"lusus naturae." Have others ever noticed 
a like condition ? I have preserved a portion 
of this cotyledon for further examination 
should occasion require.

TAKA-DIASTASE. 
Editor Medical Age: 

I have read with pleasure your remarks 
upon Taka-Diastase. I recently employed 
this new ferment in a case of diabetes melli- 
tus, being desirous of ascertaining its influ- 
ence on the amount of sugar, and its effects on 
the disordered digestion of my patient. The 
percentage of sugar remained the same, but 
a marked improvement in digestion took 
place — especially of bread-stuffs which I had 
allowed him to have. As an intestinal fer- 
ment I believe Taka-Diastase will prove far 
more valuable than trypsin.

DEATH FROM COCAINE. 

Recently in England was held an inquest as 
to the cause of death of a lady who for years 
had been under medical care suffering from 
a disease which induced excruciating torture, 
complicated moreover with neuralgia of the 
face and gums. A year before a physician 
had prescribed for her a solution of Cocaine, 
giving directions to apply it to the gums on 
cotton wool, but without specifying any 
definite quantity for the application. Just 
prior to her death she was heard to cry out, 
but, with the exception of uttering the word 
"Cocaine," was unable to speak; she died half 
an hour later. 

Before the coroner's jury there was some 
dispute as to the exact quantity of Cocaine 
that, taken internally, would cause death. 
The physician who prescribed the solution, 
w ? hich was of a strength of but two per cent., 
declared the dose the patient could have 
employed on the cotton wool would in the 
majority of instances be practically harm- 
less; yet he was called to see her just prior 
to her demise, and found her in a state of 
collapse, death taking place shortly after- 
wards, which manifestly in his opinion was 
due to the Cocaine. The jury found a ver- 
dict of "Death by misadventure." 

The foregoing evidences that too much 
care cannot be employed in prescribing this 
drug, especially for application to mucous 
membranes. This is by no means the first 
fatal result which has occurred from the self- 
employment of Cocaine even in very minute 
quantities. Finally, the words recently uttered 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 






; by Doctor Mattison in the American Medico- 
1 Surgical Bulletin are worthy of the utmost 
weight — being to the effect that the evidence 
to prove Cocaine a poison is now so ample 
that no excuse will avail to exonerate the in- 
dividual who, not heeding the lesson taught 
by the gruesome record, fails to employ the 
drug with all the caution its toxic energy 
demands. " It is peerless for good in certain 
conditions, but its power for ill must never 
be lost sight of, if one would conserve the 
best interest of those on whom it may seem 
wise to use it." 



INFANTILE SCORBUTUS. 

This was recently the subject of discussion 
at the Montreal Medico-Chirurgical Society, 
when Doctor Blackadder gave his experience 
with the malady in an infant twelve months 
old. The patient was ordered orange-juice 
diluted with water and sweetened slightly, in 
tablespoonful doses; artificial foods stopped, 
and a mixture of creamy fresh milk and thin 
barley-water substituted; once a day a des- 
sertspoonful of the red juice of a lightly 
broiled steak. Three days later the infant 
was almost well; tenderness on movement 
had disappeared, and the second night after 
change of food was the quietest and most 
comfortable of the little creature's life. Eight 
days after the infant was first seen the gums 
were perfectly healthy. Now were given iron 
and cod-liver oil, and a little carefully mashed 
potato added to the diet. In a few days the 
child was a "perfect picture of health." 

Another child, a month younger, under 
like treatment evinced an equally speedy and 
satisfactory recovery. 

It may here be said that the so-called "in- 
fant foods," so far as the latter half of the 
title is concerned, are a delusion and a snare, 
and responsible for a large share of the mor- 
tality that obtains among nurslings. Most 
mothers can, if they will, nurse their off- 
spring, and no true mother will delegate the 
rearing of her child to patent diets and the 
nursing-bottle; but if the latter is imperative, 
good cows' milk diluted one-half with barley- 
water, or for a change oatmeal-water, in the 
proportions of i to 2, or 1 to 3, will prove far 
superior to any patent price-taking " infant

cane sugar, washed starch or flour, and water. 



VERITAS VINCIT. 

The wrangle in the Washington (D. C.) 
courts between the "Great Retired" and 
other members of the so-called Columbia 
Chemical Company, has pretty thoroughly 
aired the inside workings of the Animal 
Extract business. Though well aware that 
by so doing we are giving the " Only G 
an undeserved amount of gratuitous adver- 
tising, we feel it only just to present the last 
phase in this imbroglio. 

The Columbia Chemical Company, in an- 
swer to allegations advanced by the "Great 
Retired," declares "said allegations are un- 
true and false," and that — 

This defendant will now proceed to state the 
true facts; that . . . after December, 1893, at 
which time the present officers came into control 
of the Company, they were unable to obtain from 
the said Hammond said extracts except in small 
quantities, or about a gallon at a time; that the 
charge had been brought against the extracts that 
the said Hammond in the preparation of them used 
nitroglycerin, a highly deleterious and injurious 
compound; that the said charge had been publicly 
made . . . and was highly injurious to the sale 
of said extracts. That this defendant protested 
against the use of any nitro-glycerin by the said 
Hammond, but the said Hammond denied that he 
did use nitro-glycerin; but this defendent had rea- 
son to suspect and did suspect that the said denials 
by the said Hammond were untrue, and the said 
defendant for its own protection and for the protec- 
tion of the public caused several analyses to be 
made of one of said animal extracts by one Geisler, 
the official chemist of the Mercantile Exchange of 
the City of New York, and the said Geisler reported 
to the defendant that he had found nitro-glycerin in 
said extract; that this defendant showed the letter 
to the complainant Hammond and protested against 
his having put nitro-glycerin in said extract; that 
the said Hammond secured possession of the letter 
from the said Geisler, shown by defendant, and took 
the same away with him, and denied that there was 
any nitro-glycerin in the said extracts, but this de- 
fendant thereupon procured a copy of said letter 
from the said Geisler, and herewith files a copy of 
said letter marked "Exhibit D," and refers to the 
same and prays that it may be taken as a part of 
this answer.

The Washington Pat for August 23d adds, 
the decision of the court has been wholly in 
favor of the Columbia Chemical Company as 
against the -'(ireat Retired," his son-in-law 
Manfredi Lanza, and the ''Animal Extract 
Company" — which latter appears to be a 
new organization (see page 533). 

In the case of the Columbia Chemical 
Company against the Sanitarium Company 
as to why the latter should not be punished 
for contempt on account of failure to observe 
the restraining order of July 25th, the court 
imposed a fine on Lanza, who was further 
adjudged guilty of contempt. 

We trust our non-secret and W T ile(y) friends 
in 1 )etroit and Danbury, Ct., respectively, who 
fairly tumbled over each other in eagerness 
to uphold Animal Extracts and the " Great 
Retired," are proud of the company they so 
sedulously cultivated ! 



FOOD FOR THOUGHT. 

Orthodox medicine for a half-century has 
sedulously ignored that wing of the profes- 
sion known as Homoeopathic; and yet the 
fact remains that to this body of practitioners 
medicine owes many debts, not the least of 
which are palatable therapeutics, and the ad- 
ministration of remedies for their continuous 
effects. Homoeopathy has won many men 
of the highest standing to its ranks, and this 
truth cannot be downed by the cry of charla- 
tanism. A natural query, then, arises as to 
whether more is hidden behind the title than 
appears on the surface. Is it possible homoe- 
opathy embodies a natural law in therapeu- 



:irely ignored by us of the more 
orthodox branch ? 

The foregoing is suggested by the utter- 
ances of an •' ( )!d Correspondent " in the edi- 
torial columns of the / 

nal — the editor of which, Doctor Thomas 
Dolan, is far removed from any possible 
charge of medical heresy — as follows: 

The frequent opening of new homoeopathic hos 
pitals, with attached dispensaries in the large 

towns, and the widespread popularity of th&lt; 
stitutions, has caused me to reflect anew on the 
causes of such facts. The profession should 
k the true cause, apart from all profe* 
jealousy or animosity, for we may be quite sure 
such facts have some true foundation in the order 
of nature The first thought that arises is that the 
divine instinct, even of the most ignorant of man- 
kind, reveals to them that disease must be orderly 
and subject to law. Secondly, the same divine 
instinct makes men feel that the most delicate and 
infinitesimal changes in the organism are 
and potential in their results, being parts of uni- 
versal laws The first reflection noted raises the 
hope that disease conditions are preventable and 
curable; whilst the second convinces men that the 
means to this end may be infinitely small; thus 
mankind, when in an imperfect stage of educa- 
tion, is sure to embrace hypothetical systems of 
nature, and to put faith in remedies based on wide 
but purely fanciful hypotheses. At any rate, 
whether this statement of the position be intelli- 
gent and pat to the circumstances or not, there 
must be some kind of naturo-historic foundation 
and explanation of the widespread belief in hom&lt;x?- 
opathy. To make this clearer, may be cited the fact 
that the wildest speculations and experiments of 
the alchemists throughout many centuries were in 
absolute philosophic and scientific continuity with 
the splendid accuracy and results of modern chem- 
istry and physics. Every great division of scienol 
has had its long-existing, pre-stage of obscure and 
fanciful hypotheses, and I think the homoeopathic 
theories and practice will have a place in the his 
torical development of our future and more scien- 
tific therapeutics. One is less surprised at the 
popularity of homceopathy when he reflects that 
biology has only in this generation, even in our 
greatest universities, been held to be completely 
within the domain of accurate and searching sci- 
ence. Younger men, in the freedom of the present 
day, can in no sense realize the bitter opj» 
and obloquy which attached to logical scientific 
biology prior to the days of Dai win It will, how- 
ever, be many generations before even educated 
minds, not to refer to the masses of the people, are 
rightly suffused with a true philosophy of biology. 
And if biology be so inadequately graspe ■;. 1 

pathology must be vastly more a region of con- 
jecture and wild hypotheses. Again, the labor of 
study and discipline of mind, essential in order to 



THE MEDICAL AGE.

form right biological conceptions, is pressed out of 
the education of this country owing to the para- 
mount necessities of commerce; hence it is but 
natural that a large portion of the semi-educated 
community should attach their faith to such hy- 
potheses as homoeopathy embraces, and which pro- 
fess and present to the uninformed mind the cap- 
tivating qualities of a completed system. It must 
further be remembered that orthodox medicine is 
still very much bound by the chains of the names 
of diseases. The public mind has thus been trained 
to view diseases as so many entities, and hence it 
is fitted to receive the impress of the homoeopathic 
teaching — that each symptom and each disease has 
a specific existence and a specific remedy. But of 
late years the profession has been very much sur- 
prised and gratified to find the very widest and 
most just views of biology are being taught in 
schools to which every section of the community 
has access; and we are full of faith that ere long 
great light and knowledge will pervade the mind 
of the country, and great and just views will pre- 
vail on biology, and a fortiori on pathology and 
therapeutics. 



A CENTURY AND A QUARTER OF LIFE. 

French and Russian journals recently an- 
nounced the death of Nicholas Savin, upwards 
of a century and a quarter of age. There is 
apparently no doubt as to the authenticity ot 
the case. 

It seems that this man, who arrived within 
measurable distance of doubling the usual 
span of life, was born in Paris in 1768. 
Twenty years later he enlisted as a hussar, 
and ultimately took part in most of the im- 
portant campaigns under the Consulate and 
the first Empire. During the retreat from 
Moscow, and while attempting the passage 
of the Beresina, he was wounded with a 
lance, taken prisoner by a detachment of 
Cossacks, and confined at Saratov. Having 
recovered, he was allowed the liberty of the 
city under parole, and speedily fell a victim 
to Cupid's dart, with the consequence that 
la belle France was forgotten and he became 
a resident of this Russian city, which contin- 
ued to be his home for upwards of eighty 
years. In 1887 the Emperor Alexander III., 
learning his history, sent him a present of a 
thousand roubles ($500), together with a con- 
gratulatory message which the veteran hus- 
sar valued more than money. Up to his 
death, which took place in the latter part of 
last year, Savin enjoyed excellent health and 
retained full possession of his faculties. It 



is said he left one daughter to mourn his loss 
— a tender maid of seventy-eight years. 

A century and a quarter is certainly a long 
life in these days of civilization, and R 
would appear to be the ideal land in which to 
attain such a patriarchal age, especially for a 
broken-down soldier or reformed bandit. 

A recent dispatch from St. Petersburg re- 
cords the death of a native of Samara by the 
name of Efimovin, who was a quarter of a 
century older than Savin, and who, if the re- 
port is true, belonged to a band that ravaged 
the eastern provinces and was a constant 
source of terror during the reign of Catherine 
II., under the leadership of one Pongatchev. 
With the death of the latter, Efimovin became 
chief of the banditti, but was finally captured 
and expiated his crime by thirty years of 
banishment in Siberia, when he was permitted 
to return to Russia. His death, in his one 
hundred and fifty-first year, occurred in 
April, 1894, and for a few years previous he 
had been totally blind.

Removed.— 

The ever staid and respectable Medical 
and Surgical Reporter has forsaken the "City 
of Brotherly Love" and transplanted itself to 
Gotham. Whether it will flourish better in 
the metropolis of the " Empire State " than in 
that of Pennsylvania remains to be seen. In 
the meantime we wish it all prosperity and 
success, for it is one of the few periodicals 
that lend tone and character to medical 
journalism. 

Remember! 

All the antacids and other drugs which re- 
quire for the acme of effect and activity to be 
brought in direct contact with the stomach, 
can be administered in no way so conven- 



iently and means of empty

in the presence of the gastric fluid, inasmuch 
as the cap of the capsule becomes quickly 

softened at its edges, and retracts and everts 

itself. 

The .Mississippi Vallex Medical Association. 

This organization on Friday last closed a 
most successful four days' session in Detroit. 
The number of papers presented was utterly 
overwhelming, and many could be read only 
by title. The officers for the ensuing year 
are: H. O.Walker, Detroit, President; W B 
Ricketts, Cincinnati, and F. C. Woodburn, 
Indianapolis, Vice-Presidents; Hanau W. 
Loeb, St. Louis, Secretary; Harold N. Moyer, 
Chicago, Treasurer. 

Eczema of Glans Penis.— 

Doctor Wm. Frick, of Kansas City, reports 
two cases of this somewhat rare affection. 
He believes them to have been eczematous 
merely, but personal experience evidences 
such are usually an obscure manifestation of 
syphilis, and more often found when the ini- 
tial lesion is situated within the urethra. 

A Neglected Alkaloid.— 

In the Pharmacology Section of the British 
Medical Association, Sir William Roberts 
recently read a paper on Anarcotine, which, 
according to his showing, represents the anti- 
malarial properties of opium, and in many 
cases is decidedly more efficacious than qui- 
nine as an antiperiodic. 

Where was the Antitoxin?— 

A case of recovery from tetanus, treated 
by antitoxin, is reported in the British Medi- 
cal Journal. Incidentally, however, it is 
noted that the wounded finger was ampu- 
tated and bromides, chloral hydrate, and mor- 
phine freely administered ! 

Appropriate! —

"Diphtheria Antitoxin at the Congress of 
Infernal Medicine." Italics ours, of course.

Items and News. 



A Carthaginian Truss.— 

An interesting description is given in a 
French medical contemporary of a statue 
which has been discovered at Sousse, (ancient 
Hadrumeta), in Tunis, which, according to 
several experts, represents the god Bes, a 
second- class divinity of Egyptian mythology. 




i. Upper band. 2. Middle band of cloth. 3. Lower 
band. 4. Oblique metallic pad terminating in a 
bent shank. 5. Knot and rosette. 6. Scrotum. 
7. Urinary orifice. S. Femoral hernia. 

This statue to all appearances dates from the 
Phoenician epoch, 900 years b. c. The medi- 
cal interest of the figure centres in the appa- 
ratus worn by the god, which without doubt 
is a double inguinal truss, consisting of a 
belt, on each side of which is fixed a pad in- 
clining a little obliquely both downwards and 
inwards. According to the diagnosis of M. 
Poncet, the statue also shows two femoral 
herniae, two omental scrotal herniae, and a 
most interesting peculiarity, viz., a very ad- 
mirably sculptured urinary meatus such as 
those observed in the subjects of large herniae. 
Several hypotheses are put forward to account 
for the appearance of these surgical features 
in the statue. Was it dedicated to the god 
by a grateful patient, or was it merely used 
by a manufacturer of Carthage as an adver- 
tisement for his wares? — Pacific Medical 
Journal. 



A Rare Surgical Operation.— 

Woman's skull opened, brain lifted up, and 
muscles cut from the face. Doctor J. S. 
Pyle, assisted by Doctors Harmount, House, 
and Kelly, performed a very delicate opera- 
tion at the Aultman Hospital yesterday morn- 
ing. Mrs. William Lehnis, of 216 East 
carawas street, has been suffering for the past 
six months with a very severe attack of tri- 
facial neuralgia. The left side of her face 
was so badly affected that if she started to 
talk it would cause her intense pain. It was 
decided to remove the muscles which caused 
the pain, as an only means of affording relief. 
A V-shaped piece of scalp was laid back ex- 
tending from the base of the ear to the eye, 
and up to about two inches over the eye and 
back to the ear. The skull was then drilled 
through and pulled back, leaving the brain 
exposed. The brain was lifted, and this ex- 
posed the trifacial muscles. These were cut 
off and removed, the brain let down in posi- 
tion, and the bones of the skull pushed back. 
The scalp was then sewed up. The patient 
is feeling well this morning and the neuralgia 
is entirely gone. This is only the sixth time 
the operation has been performed in the 
United States, and then it has only taken 
place in New York and Philadelphia. — Can- 
ton (Ohio) News. 

The Animal Extract Imbroglio. — 

It is a matter of some interest to physi- 
cians to learn that the Columbia Chemical 
Company, of Washington, D. C, in their 
litigation with William A. Hammond, have 
come out ahead. The courts have restrained 
Hammond, the Hammond Sanitarium Com- 
pany, Mahlon Hutchinson, and Hammond's 
son-in-law M. Lanza, from manufacturing, 
advertising or selling the animal extracts. 
It appears Hammond sold the sole right to 
these products, together with the use of the 
name, to the Columbia Chemical Company, 
but endeavored later to give the right again 
to the Sanitarium Company, in which he is a 
large stockholder. The Columbia Chemical 
Company, however, have fought the case 
with vigor, and have had their rights, under' 
their contract with Hammond, upheld in 
every particular by the courts. During the 
proceedings in court it developed that the 
formula of the animal extracts is a secret, held 
only by Hammond and the Columbia Chemical 
Co?npany. — Times and Register. 

A National Disgrace.— 

The unrestricted traffic in nostrums is a 
disgrace to civilization. Communities and 
States are up in arms against alcohol as a

ligence, the justice, in this strange partiality 
for the nostrum curse? — Western Druggist. 

Woman and the Bicycle.— 

Much has been written recently about the 
effect on women of bicycle-riding, and one 
writer mentions a case wherein the hymen 
was ruptured on the bicycle saddle. The 
Journal knows of an instance where a little 
girl ruptured her hymen in the act of riding 
a broomstick " boy fashion." Science must 
not be too exact in its investigations of the 
physiological and pathological phenomena 
produced by modern inventions for inducing 
the physical development of our girls. After 
all, science is frequently but an imitator of 
primitive nature. Who knows but what the 
graceful tandem bicycle was suggested by 
that rustic couplet — 

A hick'ry stick and a white oak saddle, 
Two little gals a ridin' straddle. 

— Journal of the Arkansas Medical Society. 

Rank Villainy.— 

John R. Mullen, of Alexander, Genesee 
County. X. Y., advertised for sale a diploma 
that belonged to his late father, issued by the 
Castleton Medical College, of Vermont. The 
matter was referred to the Board of Regents 
of the University of the State of New York, 
and they have commenced proceedings against 
Mullen for infraction of the law, which makes 
such a thing a misdemeanor. During the 
investigation it was discovered that there had 
existed a regular traffic in such diplomas. — 
The Dental Practitioner. 

A Parisian Medical Quarrel.— 

Doctors Proust and Roux are at present 
engaged in a bitter controversy concerning 
the merits of diphtheria antitoxin; a child 
died soon after receiving an injection, and 
Doctor Proust said the death was due to the 



: emedy. The controversy grew so acute that 
some of the participants even forgot their 
patriotism and asserted that the serum treat- 
ment was a German disc yway, and 
Roux simply appropriated it without warrant 
and proclaimed it as his own. — Medical Rec- 
ord. 

A Good Resolve.— 

Never pass a sound into the uterus without 
first demanding a full history of menstrua- 
; attention to this rule will often pre- 
vent tendering the designing patient a cheap 
abortion. Even with a clear history, remem- 
ber the rule of the elder Goodell: "Cervix 
hard as the tip of your nose, no pregnancy 
exists; cervix soft as your lips, pregnancy 
almost certain to exist." — Canadian Medical 
Review. 

Advertising Dishonesty.— 

In the publishers' department of the Maty- 
land Medical Journal of July 13th, Doctor 
Frank McDonald, of Pittsburg, is made to 
say: " Your Succus Alterans gives me perfect 
results. I prescribe it almost daily," etc. In 
view of the fact that Doctor McDonald has 
been dead several years, this is certainly start- 
ling news ! — Pittsburg Medical Ne:^s. 

Docking.— 

The operation is needless, painful, and cruet. 
causing the horse much suffering, and depriv- 
ing it of its only means of defense against 
flies and insects. In my opinion no la&gt;;^ 
loo strong can be employed condemning this 
operation. — Doctor Samuel K. Jon 
Surgeon New York Veterinary Hospital. 

Rationalism in Medicine.— 

Doctor Alfred H. Carter says that the 
whole fabric of rational medicine rests upon 
a tripod, of which the three divisions are: 
clinical observation and study of the signs 
and symptoms of disease; study of the path- 
ological seats and processes; study of reme- 
dies. — British Journal of Dental Science. 

Hints as to Tinned Foods.— 

Canned fruits and vegetables should be 
opened an hour or two before being used. 
In this way they become richer, as the oxy- 
gen of the air, driven off at the time of seal- 
ing, is restored. — New York Medical Times. 

Palatable Cod-liver Oil.— 

"The pleasantest way to take cod-liver 
oil," says an old gourmand, "is to fatten 
pigeons with it, and then eat the pigeons." —

The Royal Natural History. By Richard Ly- 
dekker, B.A., F.R.S., F.Z.S. Volume I, No. 4; 
paper; royal 4to; pp. 96. Price, 50 cents. 
Frederick Warne &amp; Co., New York. 

The two colored plates of the issue for 
June 15th represent respectively those rare 
creatures known as linsangs and the web- 
footed shrews. Chapter xi completes the 
history of the bats — insectivorous, smooth- 
nosed, sheath-tailed, pouch-winged, hare- 
lipped, long-tailed, wrinkled-lipped, naked, 
mastiff, white and tomb bats, — also the vam- 
pires, both harmless and blood-sucking. 

Chapter xn opens with the history of the 
order Insectivora, and deals with the codego, 
tree-shrews, jumping-shrew, hedge-hogs, com- 
mon shrews, water-shrews, musk shrews, bur- 
rowing shrews, and the different moles. 

Chapter xin is the beginning of the history 
of the order of Carnivora,the first place being 
given to the Felidcz, and chief among the cat 
tribe are the lions, a full-page illustration of 
which is given, and likewise a full skeletonian 
description. Too much cannot be said in 
praise of the portraiture of the lion tribe. 
Then follows the history of the tiger, which 
will be continued in the issue of August 1st. 

The further along this series gets, the 
greater its appreciable value. 



Science and Art of Obstetrics. By Theophilus 
Parvin, M.D., LL.D. Cloth; 8 vo; pp. 677. Price, 
$4-25. Lea Brothers &amp; Co., Philadelphia. 

The recognized position of this volume 
is shown in the thus early call for a third 
edition. In no other department of med- 
ical science is it more necessary to exhibit 
clear, definite, comprehensive and authori- 
tative knowledge; and in an appreciate. i; 
of this fact lies the remarkable success of 
this work. Professor Parvin's experience as 
an obstetrician and teacher, and his recog- 
nized literary aptitude, endow this volume 
with the qualities essential for both practi- 
tioner and student. The third edition is the 
result of thorough revision, in conformity 
with latest knowledge, and the greater por- 
tion thereof is entirely rewritten. The series 
of illustrations, moreover, has been greatly 
increased, bringing up the total number to 
267, besides two colored plates. 



Proceedings of the American Academy of Rail- 
way Surgeons. Edited by R. Harvey Reed. 
Cloth; i6mo; pp. 140. American Medical Asso- 
ciation Press, Chicago. 

This is the first issuance of the Transac- 
tions by this new Society, and appears in 
very convenient and pleasant form, barring 
the fact that the type is somewhat small. 
■ Besides the Proceedings appear a list of 
officers, official roll of fellows, and a very 
complete index. There is likewise a preface 
by the editor in the interests of railway sur- 
geons and surgical associations. 



Fromont Junior and Risler Senior. By Alphonse 
Daudet. Paper; i6mo; pp. 400. The Rand, Mc- 
Nally Co., Chicago. 

The plot of this novel is, after the prevail- 
ing fashion, unpleasant, and concerned with 
a tragic destruction of family life; neverthe- 
less the story is told both artistically and 
purely, while the genuine humanity of the 
characters, the pictures of contemporary life 
in the middle class of Parisian society, and 
the flowing and transparent style, render the 
volume especially interesting. 



Diseases of the Liver. By J. Compton Burnett, 
M.D. Cloth; 32mo; pp. 244. Price, $1.00. 
Boericke &amp; Tafel, Philadelphia. 

This is the second edition of a well known 
work. Doctor Burnett is a practitioner of first 
standing in London, England, and, though 
homoeopathic in his tendencies, is known to 
be an authority in hepatic diseases. Jaundice, 
gall-stones, liver enlargements and cancer 
are very carefully considered. 






THE MEDICAL AGE. 



Therapeutic Brevities. 



— A per- 
pend, rial incision two-and-a-half 
to three inches Wtl the middle 
of the kidney, and the organ (being ez] 
is brought into place, two long thin needles, 
threaded one on either end of a piece of 
or silkworm-gut, being used. 
The first needle is inserted through the upper 
and inner part of the cortical substance of 
the kidney, directly through the muscles of 
the back, coming out between the eleventh 
and twelfth ribs. The second needle, on the 
other end of the ligature, is also passed 
through in a similar manner, about an inch 
from its fellow, through the upper and outer 
cortical substance of the kidney; the ends of 
this ligature are tied on the integument. 
Another suture may be inserted through the 
outer margin of the kidney an inch below 
the last, the second needle passing still an 
inch lower and through the outer portion of 
the cortical substance of the kidney, the 
ligature, as before, being tied on the integu- 
ment. Care should be taken not to draw 
the sutures too tightly, but only enough to 
hold the kidney in place and set up a little 
irritation. The abdomen is closed in the 
ordinary way. Adhesions form in from one 
to two weeks, when the sutures may be with- 
drawn. Results so far are satisfactory. — 
Doctor Reed, in Therapeutic Gazette. 



Physostigmine in Glaucoma. — All glaucoma 
cases will bear Eserine (Physostigmine): 

As the greatest use is in the prodromal 
stage, the physician should be especially 
alert, and, upon the first complaint of seeing 
rainbows around luminous bodies, use the 
drug immediately: 

It works excellently, also, in acute inflam- 
matory attacks, in which it can be used every 
hour; if the pupil becomes small, the attack 
will disappear in one or two days: 

Eserine never does harm — it can be used 
for years once or twice daily, and slight irrita- 
tion of the iris under its use is very rare: 

If Eserine fails to relieve an attack, the 
patient should go at once to an oculist: 

If the glaucoma should progress in spite 
of it, an iridectomy should be done, but the 
prognosis will be doubtful: 

Follicular catarrh will only be produced 
by impure Eserine; care, therefore, should 
be taken that the drug be pure, and that the 
bottles, pipette, etc., employed be perfectly 
clean. — Doctor Herman Kohn, in Berliner 
Klinische Wochensch rift. 



The Dangtt of Alkaline Mixtu* . — Every 
.re that solutions of p 
and soda salts are apt to increase rather than 
check dyspepsia if given too long or in too 
d&lt;»ses; they may even set up cystitis — 
in cases of gastric ulcer and acid dys] 
this complication often occurs when the pa- 
tient has taken a mixture of one part of cal- 
cined magnesia and four of bicarbonate of 
soda. At Vichy visitors who go through a 
course of the Source de I'Hdpital v 
often have slight cystitis, and this has been 
observed, with hematuria, in a patient who 
took large doses of bicarbonate of soda. 1 m 
Cazal has seen hematuria, but never cystitis, 
in rheumatic subjects taking large doses of 
bicarbonate of soda. Hayem notes that the 
degree of acidity of the urine must be ascer- 
tained, in cases of acid dyspepsia, before 
alkalies are given, as there is no direct rela- 
tion between the proportion of acid in the 
gastric juice and that in the urine; when the 
latter is feebly acid the patient may be much 
damaged by alkalies. — British Medical Jour- 
nal. 



Treatment of jWerus. — Doctor H. R. Whar- 
ton states the varieties of naevus most com- 
monly met are the capillary, the port-wine 
mark (a form of the capillary of some size), 
and the venous naevus of purple or bluish 
color and at times containing blood-cysts. 
All forms of vascular tumors in young chil- 
dren should be carefully watched, and if any 
increase in size be noted they should be oper- 
ated upon. In cases of capillary naevus, cau- 
terization with nitric acid by means of a 
match-stick may answer; electrolysis is also 
of service in the treatment. The treatment 
of the port-wine mark is by multiple incision. 
In the treatment of venous naevus various 
methods have been employed. — Medical A 

[Chromic acid, in strength to meet the 
demands of the individual case, is every way 
preferable over all the caustics, in capillary 
naevus. This form often assumes a fungoid 
character, with almost uncontrollable haemor- 
rhage at times — most frequently in connec- 
tion with scorbutus — when the chromic acid 
is the sole remedy that affords satisfaction. — 
Ed.] 



Locomotor Ataxia. — Suspension in locomo- 
tor ataxia is scarcely ever heard of now, 
though in the past many observers claimed 
it relieved the tightening pains, which form 
one of the most trying symptoms. Neverthe- 
less we believe that through it several per- 
sons met their deaths by hanging. Blondel 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 






suggests — and has carried into practice — a 
method whereby the advantages of suspen- 
sion can be obtained without any of its dan- 
gers. The patient is placed on a bed, with 
the thighs flexed on the abdomen (knees and 
chin), and the legs upon the thighs; a cord 
passed round the neck and under the knees 
enables him to keep in this position for five 
minutes. This is repeated every night for 
eight days, when the pains cease, not to 
return for some weeks; when the pains 
do return, the treatment may be resumed. 
This method seems to bring about all that 
was claimed for suspension — a slight elonga- 
tion of the spinal cord; moreover, it is free 
from danger, and hence worthy of trial. — 
Canada Lancet. 



Oleomargarine. — This product has recently 
been investigated by Jolles and Winkler. 
The best artificial butter is made from care- 
fully prepared, selected fat, exposed to a 
temperature of 113 F., to which, when thin 
and fluid, milk, water and salad oil are 
added, the whole then being worked together. 
The entire process, from the veterinary in- 
spection and approval of the carcasses to the 
choice of the milk, water, and other ingredi- 
ents, is guarded by the utmost hygienic pre- 
caution; consequently such artificial butter 
is not only equal to good, genuine butter in 
nutritive value, but greatly superior to the 
latter in being much less liable to become 
rancid and in having far fewer bacteria. The 
bacteria present are only the varieties com- 
mon to air and water, — although carefully 
sought for, tubercle bacilli and other disease 
germs were never found. — Zeitschrift filr 
Hygiene. 



Intestinal Diseases of Children. — Doctor 
Phenix emphasizes the necessity of refraining 
from administering starchy or saccharine 
foods to young children. Regulation of the 
hygiene and diet should be strenuously en- 
forced. The mother's milk should always, 
if possible, be given. If observance of the 
above rules is not sufficient in ordinary infan- 
tile diarrhoea, he suggests remedies to com- 
bat fermentation and putrefaction — hydro- 
chloric acid with pepsin, sulphite of soda, 
and small doses of calomel. — Canadian Med- 
ical Review. 

[Taka-Diastase apparently here offers op- 
portunities impossible with any other remedy. 
It is at least worth the trial. — Ed.] 



because in an experience of 154 cases in the 
Willard Parker Hospital I have failed to see 
the slightest evidence that it neutralized the 
toxaemia in a single case — I have never found 
that it exerted the slightest influence for 
good in a single manifestation of the disease; 
second, I oppose it on account of its immedi- 
ate danger to life through its influence upon 
the kidneys and on the nervous system, and 
remotely through its influence on the blood. — 
Doctor Joseph Winters, in Medical Record. 

[Doctor Dillon Brown declares he will not 
employ antitoxin any more, as he has lost 
faith in its efficacy and can get better results 
from calomel fumigations. — Ed.] 



Deep-seated Eye Diseases. — The very im- 
portant question of the sub- conjunctival injec- 
tions of sublimate is again discussed in the 
leading foreign journals, and the general im- 
pression is gaining ground that the pro- 
cedure is of less value than has been claimed 
for it by its most enthusiastic admirers. In- 
deed, some ophthalmologists go so far as to 
say that they can obtain as good results by 
the sub-conjunctival injection of the ordinary 
normal salt solution, and that it is not the 
sublimate which effects the cure, but the 
irritation of the foreign substance contained 
in the given solution. Personally we have 
tried these injections with some noteworthy 
success in a few cases of keratitis, but in all 
the rest the results have been totally nega- 
tive. — Journal of Medicine and Science. 



Ivy Poisoning. — Rhus Toxicodendron, known 
also as "poison ivy," "poison dogwood," 
"poison oak," and "poison shoemake " (su- 
mac), when brought in contact with the 
human skin produces in most instances red- 
ness, itching, swelling, and vesication — often 
erysipelatous in character. Among the nu- 
merous remedies which have been employed 
for relief, the most efficient are: Lead lotion 
and sweet spirit of nitre; lactated lead lotion 
(one part subacetate of lead in fifteen parts 
of milk); powdered ipecac one drachm to 
the pint of hot water — all applied locally; 
internally, salines and diuretics. — Canadian 
Medical Review. 



Serum Treatment of Diphtheria. — I oppose 
the antitoxin treatment of diphtheria, first, 



Cystoscopy in Incontinence of Urine. — Where 
there is incontinence of urine in young pa- 
tients, the endoscope invariably reveals the 
existence of an inflamed and red zone at the 
entrance to the bladder, a little above the 
boundary line between the neck and body 
of the organ. Immediate improvement or

- to get rapid anaesthesia is the most 
dangerous plan that could possibly be de- 
vised. He believes the mortality following 
chloroform administration is largely due to

TON, in Medical Record. 



Treatment of Soft Corns. — Doctor Miall, in 
the British Medical Journal, declares that an 
ounce of perfectly freshly made tannin dis- 
solved in six drachms of water with the aid 
of gentle heat, if applied once or twice a day 
between the toes after washing, gives imme- 
diate relief to soft corns. Tannin in powder 
is not so effectual. — Medical Record. 



Chloral Hydrate in Hemoptysis. — Doctor J. 
Palvy has tried Chloral Hydrate in fifteen 
cases of haemoptysis ; doses of fifteen to 
twenty- five grains were injected per rectum. 
The effect is produced within one-half to three- 
quarters of an hour. Chloral, moreover, seems 
to be a valuable prophylactic. — American

Manag ement of Ring-worm. — This may with 
certainty be removed by first rubbing briskly 
with Turpentine until smarting is induced, 
washing with Carbolic soap (ten-per-cent.), 
and finally, after drying, applying two or 
three coats of tincture of Iodine. 



Albuminuria. — Retinitis occurring in albu- 
minuria is usually a sign that the kidney dis- 
ease is far advanced and the prospects of life 
very bad. Patients seldom live longer than 
six months after the onset of the disease. — 
Columbus Medical Journal.

onstrated by experience in maternity hos-

be used to secure this result. — Cleveland Medi-

Medical Progress, 



Chinese Medicine. — The Chinese make 
no pretense to even the lowest degree of sur- 
gical skill; they admit Western superiority 
freely — that is, for them. There is a Canton 
phrase to the effect that foreign medicine is 
well enough for a foreigner, but a Chinaman 
i requires native remedies. The Celestials have 
some rather unexpected idiosyncrasies, such 
as being sharply purged by the scale cora- 
- pounds of iron, and sniveling miserably from 
what would ordinarily be a moderate dose of 
; potassium iodide; but what they mean is a 
j difference as wide as quality will cover, and, 
i inferentially, their quality is of the better 
kind. 

They cannot amputate a finger nor open an 
abscess whose contents are not evident to 
sight; and, in Canton, though stone in the 
bladder is most common, the constant sight 
of intolerable suffering from this cause has 
I failed to nerve a native operator to under- 
take a radical cure. 

Out of about one thousand wounded that 
were treated at Newchwang last winter, there 
were two or three cases in which it was 
claimed that bullets had been cut out by the 
company officers, and one or two patients 
said they themselves had removed them, but 
I do not recall a case in which a native doctor 
had succeeded, although several presented 
that showed their feeble attempts. And one 
of the most cruel pieces of charlatanry ever 
observed occurred in this connection. These 
natural doctors, who avail themselves of every 
peculiarity of dress, equipage, and religion, 
pour quicksilver (Chinese water-silver) into 
wounds, which they know (or think) contain 
bullets, expecting it to dissolve the lead. As 
a part will run out later upon pressure, or 
upon a change of position, the sufferer can 
be persuaded that the desired end has been 
effected. At least one case presented among 
our patients in which the wound of entrance 
had been overlooked; then we had to treat a 
perforated elbow-joint that was extruding 
globules of mercury about the size of bird- 
shot, to speak in the most exact language 
which pathologists affect. 

Mr. W. F. Mayers traces the origin of 
the fire-cracker to an attempt to imitate the 
sounds made by the burning bamboos and 
rushes when the marshy districts of West- 
ern China were burned over (as they have 
been since a very early time) to diminish the 
ravages of malarial fevers. The idea of ex- 
orcism is of Indian origin, probably; at any 
rate, it has descended without abatement in 
this part of the earth from the sixth century. 



It is said differently in different places to 
prevail against small, fierce demons of human 
shape, and a bird with a nest as big as a five- 
bushel measure. 

From a retrospective point of view, it would 
appear easy to have invented some effective 
measures for the avoidance of malaria after 
the establishment of the single fact that fire 
in the marshes abated it in a sensible degree 
— particularly in a period of time of almost 
geological extension. But I am under the 
impression that no one has determined ex- 
actly the age in the history of mankind in 
which the wheel was for the first time applied 
to purposes of transportation, despite the 
ubiquitous example of the scarabaeus (for 
their regard for which I have never found it 
in my heart to blame the ancient Egyptians). 

The little minor surgical practice into 
which the general inevitables drive them, is, 
as far as my observation extends, always dele- 
terious. They use counter-irritation, set up 
by pinching the skin, scraping with glass, and 
by scratching it with the dirtiest of finger- 
nails. Acupuncture is employed, and I have 
heard of one serious injury therefrom. Their 
dread of haemorrhage amounts to agony, and 
hot resins and corrosive styptic powders are 
lavishly applied to stop even oozing. 

It is curious to reconcile the provisions 
which they, in common with most savages, 
make for draining deep wounds, with their 
impervious dressing for them — a tenacious, 
black plaster-mass, whose composition I was 
unable to learn, spread upon tough paper. 

I found all the pretentious remedial meas- 
ures of their doctors based upon some outrage- 
ous empiricism that nearly always involved 
the employment of animal, bird, or reptile, 
alive or dead, in whole or in part. I was told 
that their bear's gall was a most grateful 
emollient for the excoriation that attends 
tropical dysentery, and I hope it is true. I 
observed the following case of animal thera- 
peutics, although I have not its originator's 
rationale: A soldier, whose arm I was chiefly 
instrumental in amputating at the shoulder- 
joint for the most extensive and severe phleg- 
monous inflammation that I have ever seen, 
ascribed his terrible condition to the appli- 
cation by a Mohammedan doctor of a charred 
and powdered rat to his wound, which was a 
gunshot fracture of the middle humerus, the 
bullet remaining among the fragments of the 
bone. The limb was enormously swollen at 
the end of two days; but when I suggested 
amputation and offered him two chances out 
of ten (so their system of decadal percentage 
runs), he promptly decamped, only to return 
for the relief of amputation that is doubly 
desperate to a Chinaman. Then his arm was

truly elephantine in proportions, "Will it 
grow OQt again after you have cut it off?" he 

I me; and only a few hours before his 
. shock, and exhaustion, he 
begged me to bleed him — a request that 

ed me DO '.ess than my interpreter. I 

it think that this is a common practice 

with the Chinese, although I am aware that 

sing devils 
from the insane, as well as in veterinary 

ce, in which it seems they cut the 
cular parts of the conjunctiva; at the inner 
canthi with scissors, and secure the stimulat- 
ing effects of the sharp pain at the same 
time. 

They recognize the vital nature of the 
blood by employing blood balls — i.e., pith- 
balls soaked in the blood of criminals ex- 
ecuted at execution grounds — as a remedy 
for consumption, which they call the old or 
chronic disease — whose victims in Manchuria 
are in great part the small-footed women, so 
my medical acquaintances there considered. 

I found some of the priests of La Mission 
des Etranges, Societe de Paris, warm ad- 
mirers of their hypothetical medical skill; 
and I had them negotiate for me for some 
time for a treatment of hydrophobia which 
they commended, and which I should have 
been willing both to buy and to undergo, if I 
had not found it too repulsive; but I was 
suspected by the doctor, and he would not 
take me for a patient, notwithstanding my 
asseverated dog-bite. One of these priests 
died of hydrophobia in spite of this treat- 
ment — for which he had paid fifty francs, I 
believe. It seems rather a common disease 
in Manchuria; but the people there show no 
fear of the dogs, which divide with the hogs 
whatever scavenger work is done, being an 
altogether wretched lot of brutes, frequently 
of formidable appearance. One of my mess- 
mates saw one partly paralyzed dying of the 
convulsions of rabies in a crowded street; 
and absolutely no notice was taken of its 
struggles, except when they brought about 
actual contact with the person. There is a 
curious superstition connecting the onset of 
hydrophobia in man with growing hemp, for 
a knowledge of which I am indebted to D. C. 
Gray, of the Presbyterian Mission at Liao 
Yang, Manchuria. He says he has seen sev- 
eral cases, in all of which the origin of the 
attack was ascribed to having passed a hemp- 
field after being bitten, and that a dog-bitten 
Chinaman in that part of the country will 
undertake any circumambulation rather than 
pass one. He states further that it is a rec- 
ognized practice with his rivals, the native 
practitioners, to fill the wound made by the 
dog's teeth with lice, which are accredited 



with the power of devouring the poison 
hydrophobia. I am indebted also t 
Mine gentleman for an account of a meth&lt; 
of inquiry practiced by the magisir.. 
Liao Yang to determine whether a man th;

ment of being beaten with a bamboo. 
his death to the punishment, or had swallowe&lt; 
opium with suicidal intent in his rage at th&lt; 
degradation. It was conducted in the 
general manner a bed in th&lt; 

deal Record, April 6th, 1S95, with the dif- I 
ference that the skeleton was cleaned I 
boiling in an enormous cauldron at one oH 
the city gates, and certain spots found in the I 
marrow of the femora, which were sawn I 
through lengthwise, were held to prove sui- I 
cide by opium. Their absence would have I 
made the magistrate liable for excessiveljM 
beating him. 

Another striking instance of the utter im- 
practicableness of this so called practical 
people came under my immediate notice re- 
cently. A passenger-junk was going up one 
of the streams near Shanghai with a score or 
so of passengers on board — no one knows 
how many exactly — when a water-snake, of 
a kind both numerous and well developed 
here, was seen on her lee hand. The pas- 
sengers crowded upon that side to look, and 
the boat capsized. Several bodies were re- 
covered in a few minutes, one of which was 
ultimately restored to life. All were laid 
across the thwarts and bulkheads of other 
boats in order to get the water out of them; 
no one present knew of the necessity of get- 
ting the air into their lungs, or, at least, of 
a reasonable way to do it. They were ex- 
tremely anxious to hang each of them over a 
cow and exercise her vigorously in the ad- 
jacent fields; but there was no dairy con- 
venient, and some objection was forthcom- 
ing from the owner of the crops, and the 
plan was abandoned. I saw the corpses 
full day after the accident, merely covered 
with a piece of matting in a boat alongside 
the one to which the mishap had occurred; 
the latter had been righted and drawn up 
partially on the bank, but there was no one 
to claim her, as that would have made him 
liable for damages for the loss of life. 

It is my opinion that those in favor of the 
unrestricted introduction of opium have mad&lt; 
out a stronger case in favor of the traffic 
than has an unquestioned right to be stated, 
although I am by no means willing to im- 
pugn their honesty in the premises. I make 
this statement with full allowance for its 
prophylactic action, of which I am convinced, 
against malaria; for its small tendency to 
provoke criminal offenses; and for abuses of

it for which the user and not the drug is ulti- 
mately responsible. To sustain this position, 
I shall simply appeal to any physician who 
has experience in the treatment of any phys- 
ical ailment of those addicted to its use. I 
saw it used liberally by the wounded soldiers 
throughout last winter, many of whom I ob- 
served to acquire the habit from its accessi- 
bility and from the ready amelioration the 
pipe afforded their sufferings. It was a weird 
sight that the long kangs (sleeping-platforms 
heated by burning stalks of sorghum or 
rushes in the flues under them) presented 
about the time of my night round of the hos- 
pital, with one opium-smoking outfit for, at 
most, every ten patients, literally in full blast. 
It is as impossible to forget the sickly sweet- 
ish odor of the clouds of steam that a smoker 
emits, as it was then to blame those unfortu- 
nate and half-hearted defenders of their 
country for their lack of self-denial. Some 
of these men were as yellow as parch- 
ment from its effects. In general it seemed 
to reduce greatly the capacity of tissues for 
repair; but one remarkable case recovered 
from seven wounds that included a fracture 
of the thigh and gunshot injuries to a wrist 
and to an elbow-joint, although he smoked a 
large quantity daily. Even here there was 
not the same activity of the processes that a 
normal case would have shown — which may 
have been to his advantage, — and his injuries 
were from shrapnel balls, and hence, I think, 
probably simple. 

An application of this drug not hitherto ob- 
served by me is resorted to by brothel-keep- 
ers to cure the inmates of their places of 
sulkiness. Acupuncture-needles are smeared 
with opium and heated, and then thrust 
deeply into the tissues of the unhappy wretch. 
As a woman doctor, a missionary out here — 
whose name I have forgotten — aptly says, 
this plan is admirably adapted for provoking 
emotions of some kind. An inquiry is now 
in progress in this city concerning the death 
of a girl upon whom this atrocity had been 
inflicted. 

The saddest sights to be seen in all this 
awful country are afforded by the insane, 
who are habitually abused. This empire has 
been and will be for many ages, if one may 
predict the future from the past, the settled 
home of demonology, upon whose easy as- 
sumptions these aberrations of consciousness 
are explained with no doubts to torment the 
explainers. 

The comparative ^frequency of hernia 
among the laboring class seems to offer an 
opportunity to learn something of how to 
decrease its prevalence with us. It is uni- 
versally characterized by the Chinese laity as 



an affection of the weak. Do strength and 
good health forbid its incurrence in America 
and England ?— Do&lt; roi W i . 
U. S. Navy, in Southern Practitioner. 



Statistical Repori on ; 
Males, ten; females, five. The ages ranged 
from three years to eighty-three. The ani- 
mals to which the disorder was ascribed 
were: In thirteen cases, dogs; in two cases, 
cats. The incubations varied from three 
weeks to six months. Four of the deaths 
followed bites of dogs unsuspected of having 
rabies. Of the fifteen cases, one was unmis- 
takably due to drink and uraemia; one was 
considered hysteria at Bellevue Hospital, and 
died soon afterward under the care of the 
New York Pasteur Institute; three were plain 
lyssophobia (one dying in the Xew York Pas- 
teur Institute), and one "mewing like a cat'* 
(a cat-bite case). The pernicious use of 
strong narcotics is notable in the treatment 
of many of the fifteen cases I have collected, 
and the apparent uselessness of cauteriza- 
tions with silver nitrate. 

I have made a study of my records for 
five years of what I have labeled "mad-dog 
scares." The result indicates that in fifty- 
five instances of alarms about mad dogs, 
with a record of one hundred and seventy- 
five persons, of all ages, bitten, I have found 
only three deaths from so-called "hydro- 
phobia." This, if correct, would indicate 
that the natural mortality from the bites of 
rabid dogs is 1.58, or less than two per cent. 
The vast majority of the deaths attributed to # 
hydrophobia have followed bites by unsus- 
pected dogs, and very few have followed 
bites by dogs that ran amuck and that ex- 
cited alarm at the time. It is a curious fact, 
taken in connection with this one, that a 
very large number of the deaths from so- 
called hydrophobia followed the bites of dogs 
that had no history or appearance of any 
disease. 

The number of cases for the past year is 
about what I have before reported for other 
years; the total probably does not include 
all that have occurred in the United States; 
but I think it represents the actual figures as 
accurately as the statistics attainable in other 
countries, without government assistance. 
Against this number of actual deaths we may 
set the absurd claims put out by Pasteur In- 
stitutes of so-called "cures." Last year the 
Institute in Paris treated 1194, all supposed 
to be liable to die of hydrophobia, and these 
figures will probably be used to support the 
assertion, copied into books all over the

world, that Pasteur baa reduced the mor- 

from hydrophobia to less than one per 
cent. bitten by rabid animals. It is

in Surgical Pra&lt; riCE. — The 

lack of dexterity and accuracy, which leads 
»w and consequently imperfect operat- 
ing, is the most noticeable; every moment 
wasted in an operation is a detriment to the 
patient as well as to the surgeon. Rapidity 
of operating is especially necessary in order 
to avoid prolonged anesthesia, which is in- 
jurious and tends to retard recovery by 
favoring non-union, suppuration, and sepsis. 
Time is also precious, because the longer the 
tissues are exposed and the more they are 
handled, the more slowly and imperfectly 
they heal. Tissues exposed to the air for an 
hour or more begin preparation for healing 
by granulation, and are therefore less capable 
of uniting by immediate union. Since the 
introduction of antiseptic surgery, imperfec- 
tions are apt to arise from the endless detail 
necessary, which in itself makes it difficult to 
attain perfection. Another source of defect 
is the disposition on the part of some to de- 
vise new operations and to modify (in the 
hope of improving) old ones, while they are 
in black darkness regarding how to perform 
many of the operations that are known to be 
.quite efficient and well established by the 
surgeons of the past and present. The en- 
deavor to cover too much ground is also a 
mistake; for if one endeavors to wrestle with 
the whole field of operative surgery, he finds 
such a number and variety of operations to 
do that one life is not enough for him to 
perfect himself in them all. — Doctor Alex- 
ander Skene, in Brooklyn Medical Journal. 



Dermoid Cyst OF Anterior Mediasti- 
nal — This occurred in a soldier, aged 
twenty-two, the symptoms being prominence 
of right chest, difficulty of respiration, and 
severe coughing terminating in efforts at 
vomiting. Auscultation gave negative re- 
sults. During three years the chest was 
aspirated on several occasions, some forty 
ounces of a yellowish non-purulent fluid be- 
ing removed. Finally the patient returned 
to the hospital, when in the neighborhood of 
two inches of the fourth rib was excised and 
the aspirator needle introduced into a sac 



(which could not be determined as either 
extra- or intra-plenral) of a capacity of about 

fifty-six ounces; from the fluctuating portion 
of this a thick, turbid, greenish fluid was with- 
drawn, devoid of both pus and blood but 
mixed with particles resembling grain 
rice colored with saffron. Irrigation brought 
away nothing but hair, skin, and sebaceous 
matter. As the sac was adherent on all sides, 
it was determined to obliterate its cavity by 
exciting inflammation, for which purpose 
tincture of Iodine was employed and Iodo- 
form gauze introduced. Four months later 
the patient was apparently in perfect health, 
a small retro-costo-sternal fistula remaining. 
Twenty-three similar cases are to be found 
in literature. — Doctor DARDIGNAC, in . 
de Chirurgie. 



Effect of Removal of Ovaries upon 

Sexual Appetite. — Miss X , 25 years of 

age, who had her ovaries and tubes removed 
about seven years ago on account of pain and 
enlargement, consulted me for a discharge, 
which proved to be gonorrhoea. She told 
me her menstruation had gradually left her, 
until the end of the year, when it disappeared 
entirely, so that she had had no periods during 
the last six years. Recently, here in Mon- 
treal, she met a former male acquaintance 
and had intercourse with him, and during 
this act became very excited, having an 
orgasm, and straining herself, which she 
thought was the cause of her discharge. On 
fuather inquiry she assured me she never had 
experienced so much sexual pleasure as she 
did now, and in her opinion the removal of 
the ovaries in no way lessens the feelings of 
a woman toward the opposite sex. This, 
of course, is not the general belief, and I 
therefore think it well to report this case as 
one among many others in which the removal 
of the ovaries has not been followed by loss 
of sexual desire, but, on the contrary, by a 
marked increase of it. — Doctor A. Law 
thorn Smith, in the Medical Record. 



Effect of Ovariotomy upon 1111: \ 
— The effect of castration in young males in 
heightening the pitch of the voice led Doctor 
Moure to investigate the results accruing 
from ovariotomy. In two young women the 
voice became deeper, harsher, and hoarser, 
the higher notes were lost, and the voice fell 
from soprano to mezzo-soprano. These ob- 
servations are obviously insufficient to estab- 
lish a theory, and, as no previous cases are on 
record, further confirmation is needed. — Bos- 
ton Medical and Surgical Journal.

OUTLINES OF SANITARY ORGANIZATION 

OF SOME OF THE GREAT ARMIES 

OF THE WORLD.* 

BY MAJOR JOHN VAN RENSSELAER HOFF, SUR- 
GEON U. S. ARMY. 

{Continued from page 5 ig.) 

III. THE ARMY OF SWITZERLAND. f 

The Federal Council, the highest military 
authority, controls the War Department, 
which for convenience of administration is 
subdivided into bureaus. The head of one 
of these, the Medical Department, is the' 
Chief Medical Officer, a colonel, who directs 
the entire sanitary service of the army in 
time of peace, including the recruitment, in- 
struction and discipline of the sanitary (H. 
C.) corps, and the control of all the material 
of his department. In his office are: an as- 
sistant (" chef de bureau"), a secretary, a clerk, 
and a staff apothecary officer (major) who 
assists in matters connected with medical 
supplies; and in time of war a chief of the 
hospital service, a chief of the voluntary 
sanitary service, and an apothecary officer 
are added. 

There is also, in active service, a Principal 
Medical Officer who is the immediate head 
of the sanitary service in the field, eight field 
hospitals ("Elite"), sixteen ambulance hos- 
pitals ("Landwehr"), five transport columns, 
three sanitary railway trains (" Landwehr "); 



*Read before the Association of Military Sur- 
geons. 

f Information upon the subject of this paper has 
been sought from convenient sources, and the com- 
piler has equally freely used the substance and the 
words of the various original reports, etc., from 
which he has gleaned. He is particularly indebted 
to the Military Information Division of the Adju- 
tant-General's Office, U. S. A., for valuable assist- 
ance. 



and eight hospital sections (" Landwehr ") 
may also be mobilized. The various arms 
of the service take precedence among them- 
selves in the following order: Infantry, Cav- 
alry, Artillery, Engineers, Sanitary Troops, 
and Administration Troops. All officers of 
the various departments, except chaplains, 
hold actual military rank and are addressed 
by their military titles. The rank of medical 
officers ranges from first lieutenant to colonel, 
that of apothecary officers from lieutenant 
to major. 

In the establishment of a Field Hospital 
there is one medical officer (major) com- 
manding; also, one administrative medical 
officer (captain or lieutenant), one apothecary 
officer (captain or lieutenant), one chaplain 
and sometimes two, one clerk (lance-cor- 
poral), and one attendant (non-commissioned 
officer). Attached from Second Division 
"Landwehr" Train Battalion are: One cap- 
tain, one lieutenant, one veterinary officer, 
one sergeant-major, one quartermaster-ser- 
geant, nine lance-corporals, two trumpeters, 
one wheelwright, two collar - makers, two 
farriers; twelve requisitioned carriages for 
wounded (twenty-four draught horses), two 
requisitioned carriages for provisions (four 
draught horses), two requisitioned carriages 
for baggage (four draught horses), two ma- 
terial wagons (" fourgons") with eight draught 
horses, thirty-five men, seven saddle horses, 
and fifty-six draught horses (of which six- 
teen are spare). 

The Hospital Ambulance Establishment 
consists of one chief with rank of captain, 
at least three other medical officers (cap- 
tains or first lieutenants), one quartermas- 
ter (first lieutenant or lieutenant), two hos- 
pital attendants (non-commissioned officers), 
one apothecary officer (first lieutenant or 
lieutenant), ten hospital attendants (lance- 
corporals), two or four bearers (non-com- 
missioned officers), twenty or twenty-four

n with t .'. grht horses. Mountain 

ambulances may be formed, as required, from 
of the regular ambulances 

equipped from the field hospitals. The equip- 
ment mountain ambulances is perma- 
nently kept up for the Eighth Army Division. 

To the sanitary \ the "Landwehr" 

3 gned the duty of organizing any neces- 
sary number of ambulances; there are at 
at sixteen in this branch of the national 
forces It is intended the transportation 
(wheeled) for these ambulances will be requi- 
sitioned. The sanitary personnel not thus 
employed will be distributed among the hos- 
pitals and transport columns, etc., mentioned 
»w. 

The field hospitals are numbered 1 to 8, 
according to the divisions to which they be- 
long. The ambulances of the "Elite" are 
numbered 1 to 40; numbers 1 to 5 belonging 
to the first field hospital, and so on. Those 
of the "Landwehr" are numbered 1, 2; 6, 7; 
ii, 12; 16, 17; 21, 22; 26, 27; 31, 32; 36, 37; 
numbers 1 and 2 belonging to the first divi- 
sional district, 6 and 7 to the second, n and 
12 to the third, and so on. 

For the transport and care of the sick and 
wounded sent from the front during military 
operations, the following sanitary reserves 
will be furnished by the " Landwehr " of the 
whole army: Five transport columns, three 
sanitary railway trains, and eight hospital 
sections. The transport columns are intended 
to cooperate with the railways and steam- 
boats for conveying the sick and wounded 
from the field hospitals to permanent insti- 
tutions. 

The establishment of a Transport Column 
of the Sanitary Reserve consists of one prin- 
cipal medical officer (captain), one medical 
officer (captain or first lieutenant), ten hos- 
pital attendants, two non-commissioned offi- 
cers, thirty-two requisitioned carriages (sixty- 
four draught horses) — thirty of which vehicles 
are for the sick, the other two being re- 
served for baggage and provender. These 
transport columns are numbered 1 to 5; and 
the sanitary trains, as far as possible, will be 
supplemented by ordinary railway trains in

ei ial for furnishing 
Mich trains is to be kept in store in 
the federal magazines; that required for 
two trains already exists. After providing 
the ambulance and sanitary trains, the re- 
mainder of the personnel of the " Landwehr" 
sanitary troops — and, if necessary, other 
supernumeraries — will form eight hospital 
sections, each capable of manning a military 
hospital of 200 beds. The establishment of 
these sections has not yet been definitely de- 
termined, but will probably be as follows: 
One principal medical officer, two or three 
assistant medical officers, one apothecary 
officer, ten to twenty hospital attendants. In 
1891 a corps organization for the Swiss Army 
was definitely adopted, and each army corps 
has attached to its staff a chief medical offi- 
cer and a corps field hospital. — In the Sec- 
ond Corps, this hospital consists of four am- 
bulances. Each division has one divisional 
medical officer (lieutenant-colonel), one ad- 
jutant of divisional medical officer, one staff 
clerk, and one hospital attendant. In the 
total staff there are thirty-eight officers of 
field hospitals (including " Landwehr" train), 
twenty-eight non-commissioned officers, 232 
lance-corporals and other enlisted men, 
twenty saddle horses, 106 draught ditto, and 
thirty-eight carriages. 

Among the number of officers and staff 
clerks at the immediate disposal of the Fed- 
eral Council at the present time are two 
medical officers, nine lieutenant-colonels, nine 
majors, and one apothecary officer (major), 
all of the Sanitary Troops. Of the supernu- 
merary troops placed at the direct disposal 
of the General Commanding the Army (in 
time of war) are: Five transport columns of 
the sanitary reserve, three sanitary trains 
(railway), and six hospital sections. 

In the establishment of the Staff of Army 
Headquarters, Duty Section, are one medical 
officer and two hospital attendants. 

The Medical Division of the Staff of the 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 






Army consists of one principal medical offi- 
cer, two medical officers (adjutants — one of 
whom acts as medical officer of Headquar- 
ters Staff), and one staff clerk. 

The normal and actual strength of the 
Sanitary Service ("Elite") is 4500 sanitary 
troops normal establishment, and 4950 actual 
strength. The "Landwehr" at present con- 
tains 2954 sanitary troops normal establish- 
ment, and 1555 actual strength. — In the 
total of the sanitary troops of the "Elite" is 
included the second divisions of the "Land- 
wehr" train battalions which are required to 
horse the field hospitals. 

Sanitary Troops Recruit School* — The ses- 
sion of the Medical Section of the Recruit 
School lasts forty-six days, during the first 
eleven of which the necessary military in- 
struction is given to a school of infantry 
recruits, who thereupon undergo a tech- 
nical course of thirty-five days. Non-com- 
missioned officers attend a "cadre" school 
during the last twenty-one days of this pe- 
riod. At the conclusion of the course, can- 
didates for the grade of hospital attendant 
are selected from the litter-bearers, and put 
through a further course of twenty-one days 
(termed a "Cours d'Hopital ") in Cantonals 
hospitals. In 1886, 400 recruits passed through 
the recruit schools, of whom 161 subsequently 
attended the hospital course, and all but four 
became hospital attendants. In 1887, 434 
recruits passed through the school. There 
is likewise a repetition course which all mil- 
itary medical officers must, during their term 
of service, attend for a period of fourteen 
days — this is termed a "Cours d'Operation," 
and two courses are held each year, about 
twenty medical officers of the rank of captain 
attending each. The instruction is partly 
medical and surgical and partly military. In 
addition there is a special course for superior 
medical officers; this was found necessary in 
consequence of great changes in duties pre- 
scribed by the new medical regulations. The 
instruction includes a series of practical prob- 
lems to be discussed and worked out, both in 
the lecture-room and in the field, the exer- 
cises being directed by an officer of the Gen- 
eral Staff. It is proposed to extend the

instructions to all medical officers of the rank 
of captain who are nominated for promotion. 

With regard to the personnel of the Sani- 
tary Service, twelve out of forty ambulances 
are usually exercised each year (and accord- 
ing to the scheme at present in force, five 
ambulances of each of the eight "field hos- 
pitals are called out for three repetition 
courses in ten years): two ambulances during 
the year at battalion exercises, four during 
brigade, two during regimental, and four 
during divisional maneuvres. 

Of the sanitary personnel of the troops 
(infantry, cavalry, etc., as distinguished from 
the field hospitals), the senior medical officers 
of the battalions and four hospital attendants 
only in the infantry, and all the sanitary per- 
somiel of the special arms, perform their 
repetition courses with their corps. The rest 
of the infantry medical staff (second medical 
officer, non-commissioned officers, and bear- 
ers) undergo their course with the ambu- 
lances. For the divisional and brigade ma- 
neuvres, a detachment of sanitary troops is 
always to be called out and instructed under 
an officer of the Sanitary Staff. 

The Officers' Preparatory School — Medical 
Section — is located at Basle, and two courses, 
each lasting thirty-two days, are given. After 
passing through the school, forty or fifty 
medical men and four to eight apothecaries 
are annually commissioned as sanitary offi- 
cers. Only physicians and apothecaries of 
suitable scientific acquirements who have 
passed through a recruit school can be nomi- 
nated to join officers' preparatory schools 
with a view of obtaining commissions in the 
Sanitary Troops. The conditions to be ful- 
filled for the first appointment and promotion 
of officers are: For apothecary officer with 
the rank of lieutenant, a certificate of capa- 
city: For medical officer with the rank of 
first lieutenant, a certificate from an officers' 
preparatory school; with the rank of captain, 
service as first lieutenant for two years and 
certificate of capacity; with the rank of major, 
service as captain for two years and selection: 
with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, service as 
major for two years and selection; with the 
rank of colonel, selection among the lieuten- 
ant-colonels. Certificates of capacity for first 
appointments as officers are given at the 
termination of the session of the officers'

their opinion from the reports made on the 
candidates during the courses of instruction, 
consideration being given to the right of 
nomination which is vested by law in the im- 
mediate commanding officers of the persons 
concerned. Commanding ofneers submit 
their nominations through their immediate 
superiors, and these in forwarding to the 
Chief Instructor also express their opinions 
on the proposed officers. The certificates 
are submitted to the "Chef d'Armee" (and 
divisional commanders in the case of infan- 
try) for their counter-signature, and finally 
transmitted to the Military Department. The 
Chief Instructors, if they deem it necessary, 
are empowered to examine officers proposed 
for promotion before issuing certificates of 
capacity. Officers who have been relieved 
from service on account of age may be re- 
employed if they wish it and the authorities 
think fit. Mounted officers are entitled to a 
civilian servant or allowance in lieu thereof, 
during active service and also during instruc- 
tional courses; the daily allowance for a 
civilian servant being sixty-five cents, or 
fifty cents if rations or quarters are found. 
Civilian servants who are sick or injured in 
service are entitled to free rations, quarters, 
and medical treatment, and to ten cents daily 
pay, and all civilian servants are subject to 
military law. Men sick in hospital are sub- 
sisted by the hospital authorities, and for the 
subsistence and treatment of officers sent to 
hospital during instructional service a daily 
allowance of fifty cents is authorized. During 
active service, however, the Confederation 
pays for the subsistence and medical treat- 
ment of all sick officers. 

Mere length of service confers no claim to 
pension in the Swiss Army. Every three 
years the Federal Council (which is the su- 
preme authority in all matters relating to 
pensions) nominates a commission which sits 
under the direction of the Military Depart- 



ment, and inv - all claims on behalf 

of the Council. This u Pensions- kommis- 

sion" consists (1889) of the chief m&lt; 

• r, a brigadier-Colonel, a lieutenant 

mel of infantry, and a me-' er. 

The Communes provide not only all the 
requisitioned carnages laid down m the 
regulations, for which they receive an in- 
demnity, but must also comply without delay 
with all requisitions for transport for mili- 
tary purposes. Under the latter head are in- 
cluded: Provisions and baggage wagor 
corps; wagons for the sick required by the 
field hospitals and transport columns of the 
sanitary reserve; harness and wagon-covers 
for the foregoing if these cannot be furnished 
from corps material; wagons, horses and 
drivers for provision columns, lines of com- 
munication, and carriage parks; the same 
for transports of detachments and single 
soldiers, sick, baggage, etc., for which army 
transport is not provided; horses for assist- 
ing transport to ascend steep hills; pack 
animals; carriers; guides; workmen to clear 
and repair roads, etc.; and transport boats. 

The Chief Medical Officer of the Sanitary 
Service, who is the permanent official at the 
head of this branch, has the following duties 
in time of peace: Responsibility for the re- 
cruiting and instruction of the sanitary troops 
and for the preparation of regulations re- 
garding the medical service: Nomination of 
medical officers for appointments, promo- 
tion, and retirement: Distribution of the san- 
itary personnel of all ranks to the various 
units, with the approval of the Military De- 
partment: The superior direction of the com- 
missions appointed to conduct the medical 
examination of recruits for all arms: Respon- 
sibility for sanitary material of every descrip- 
tion — he must see that the clothing and 
equipment of the sanitary troops are com- 
plete and fit for immediate use. He organ- 
izes the medical service for all assemblies of 
troops, whether for instructional purposes or 
for active service, indicating the hospitals 
and dispensaries which are placed at their 
disposal; makes such proposals and arrange- 
ments as he thinks necessary for insuring the 
health of the troops, including questions of 
provisioning, clothing and housing the men; 
exercises general supervision over voluntary 
aid associations. Likewise he reports on al

claims for pension or indemnity, and is ex- 
officio a member of the Pension Commission; 
checks and countersigns all accounts con- 
nected with the medical service; and prepares 
the yearly estimate, for the medical service. 
On mobilization for active service, the medi- 
cal peace establishment of an assistant, a 
secretary and a clerk is augmented by a 
deputy (a senior medical officer), a chief of 
the hospital service, a chief of the voluntary 
aid service, and a staff apothecary. The 
Chief Medical Officer is then charged with 
making all arrangements for putting the 
medical service on a war footing, the aug- 
mentation of personnel and material, estab- 
lishment of military hospitals, arrangements 
for the transport of sick from the initial 
stations of the lines of communication rear- 
wards, the instruction of newly raised levies, 
organization of voluntary aid, and supervision 
of the entire territorial sanitary service and 
its coordination with that of the troops in the 
field. 

The Chief of the Hospital Service superin- 
tends the organization and administration of 
the permanent hospitals, and keeps the chief 
medical officer of the lines of communication 
informed of the available accommodation in 
the hospitals. 

The Chief of the Voluntary Aid Service 
superintends the general working of volun- 
teer ambulance associations, and maintains 
constant communication with the principal 
medical officer of the army in the field, with 
the object of insuring the useful employment 
of the personnel and material placed at the 
disposal of the State by voluntary associa- 
tions. 

The Staff Apothecary, in peace and war, 
superintends the provision, and is responsible 
for the quality, of all drugs supplied to the 
army. 

The directing medical officers of the field 
army are: the Principal Medical Officer; the 
Corps, the Divisional and Infantry Brigade 
Senior Medical Officers, who are under the 
orders of the military commanders to whose 
staffs they are attached, and responsible to 
them, as well as to their own medical supe- 
riors, for the conduct of the whole medical 
service of troops under their supervision. 
The commanding officers are required to 
give them such information as to proposed 



movements of troops — and especially as to 
dispositions for impending engagements — as 
will enable them to make suitable arrange- 
ments for the dressing-stations, etc., and a 
directing medical officer must in all cases 
submit his proposals for the general organi- 
zation of the medical service in the field for 
the approval of the commanding officer, of 
his chief of staff, before issuing orders on the 
subject. 

The Principal Medical Officer with the 
troops keeps the Chief Medical Officer con- 
stantly informed of all important occurrences 
in the field which require to be known at the 
home medical headquarters, is responsible for 
the coordination of the field service with that 
of the lines of communication, for the timely 
demand for medical supplies and reinforce- 
ment of personnel, and generally for the work- 
ing of the entire medical service of the army 
in the field. 

The Chief Medical Officer on the lines of 
communication is under the orders of the 
Principal Medical Officer of the Army, and is 
responsible for the arrangements for the 
transport of sick and wounded from the field 
to the permanent hospitals, and to this end 
has under his orders the transport columns, 
sanitary trains and transport corps attached 
to them, and the lines-of-communication hos- 
pitals and medical service generally: he is 
further responsible for the mobilization of the 
requisite number of transport columns at the 
terminal stations, and for their being in im- 
mediate communication with the ambulances 
and provisional hospitals in the field, and 
generally for the establishment and distribu- 
tion of the requisite sanitary trains and lines- 
of-communication hospitals at suitable sta- 
tions. He reports all return transport of 
sick to the Chief of the Hospital Service. 

The Divisional Medical Officers are re- 
sponsible at all times for the entire medical 
service of their divisions. In time of peace 
(and when no principal medical officer of the 
army is appointed) they are under the orders 
of the Chief Medical Officer in all matters 
of sanitary service; when in active service, 
under those of the Principal Medical Offi- 
cer of the Army; the field-hospital and all 
other sanitary troops of the division are 
under their orders. In time of peace the 
Divisional Medical Officer is president of

i :s the field hospitals at

measures necessary fur maintaining the health 
of the troops. On the held of battle he fixes 
the principal dressing and ambulance stations 
•rding to the general indications of the 
Chief of Staff, and takes the requisite steps 
for evacuation of the wounded. 

For every permanent place of assembly of 
detachments of troops, and every permanent 
Federal barrack station, the Surgeon-in-Chief 
nominates a Station Surgeon (" Medicine de 
Place"), who is chosen from among the resi- 
dent medical officers serving or retired from 
service; as a rule the engagement is for one 
year. When any body of troops assembles 
at his station without its medical officers, the 
Station Surgeon performs the duties of the 
latter, and also assists, with advice and other- 
wise, those medical officers who may be 
called upon for duty with the troops. If 
there is a military hospital at the station, he 
is ex-ofricio surgeon thereto, and he is respon- 
sible for the sanitation of the barracks and 
the health of the troops quartered in them. 
For every day of service he receives $1.35 
pay, with sixty cents extra for each day on 
which he acts as surgeon to a military hos- 
pital. If he accompanies the troops during 
exercise in field service, he receives the pay 
of his rank, and horse allowance. 

The routine duties of the medical service 
are: With the troops; in field hospitals; in 
permanent hospitals; and when the sick are 
treated by private physicians. 

The Medical Staffs of the various units 
have heretofore been enumerated. The per- 
sonnel attached to the line consists of medical 
officers, bearers, and hospital attendants 
whose duty is to give first aid to the sick and 
wounded. During peace, and when in can- 
tonment, mild cases of illness which are not 
likely to last more than a few days are 
treated in corps infirmaries, but more severe 
cases are removed to civil hospitals. 



There ate military hospitals ml of 

the large barrack rn, Thun, 

rdinarily 
only during the training sessions. At stations 
where such do not r soldier during 

training is treated in civil hospitals, and — if 
his illness is not tl WD neglect 

or misconduct — at the ■• of the 

federation. 

The Swiss Field Hospital maybe looked 
upon as a medical battalion consisting of 
staff and five companies, the latter bein 
termed "ambulances." The staff has sixteen 
requisitioned wagons, of which twelve are 
fitted up for the wounded (and attached as 
required to one or other of the ambulances), 
two for provisions, and two for baggage and 
cooking, and a column of reserve material, 
consisting of two wagons of medical stores, 
and sixteen spare horses. Each ambulance, 
which is really a movable field hospital, has 
four wagons, including one for the wounded. 
In time of war all these are horsed and driven 
by the second division of the "Landwehr" 
train battalion of the Division; in time of 
peace, by supernumerary men of the two 
divisions of the "Elite" train battalion, or 
any train soldiers available. Farther, mate- 
rial for two mountain ambulances (arranged 
for pack animals) is at the disposal of the 
Eighth Army Division, and each field hos- 
pital is capable of forming two small moun- 
tain ambulances. The ambulances can be 
used to form sick depots — i. e., corps infirma- 
ries for several units, — as collecting-stations 
during marches, as principal dressing-stations 
during engagements, and as evacuating-sta- 
tions at the terminal stations of the lines of 
communication. The removal of the sick 
and wounded from regiments and dressing- 
stations of the first line to the principal 
dressing-stations may be effected by the am- 
bulance wagons (one per ambulance) and the 
carriage column of the field hospital (twelve 
wagons attached to the ambulances); but 
whenever possible, as during peace service, 
the troops themselves remove their sick to 
the ambulances in their own transport. If 
"Landwehr" troops should be attached to a 
division, an ambulance will be added to the 
"Elite" field hospital thereof. — These ar- 
rangements complete what are known as the 
first and second lines of medical assistance, 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 






which are concerned with the treatment and 
evacuation of the wounded on the field of 
battle, and are under the orders of the Divi- 
sional or Principal Medical Officer of the 
Army. In rear of these again is organized a 
third line consisting of permanent hospitals, 
which are placed at the limit of the field of 
operations or on the lines of communication. 

As a rule, sick and wounded who cannot 
be treated with their regiment or in the field 
hospitals {i.e., ambulances) will, in time of 
peace, be removed to the civil hospitals en- 
gaged by special contract. If these do not 
suffice in time of war, permanent hospitals 
are established (classified as principal and 
reserve hospitals, special hospitals for infec- 
tious diseases, and convalescent stations), 
which are under the immediate orders of the 
Chief of the Hospital Service before men- 
tioned, and manned by the hospital sections, 
assisted by voluntary aid associations. Ma- 
terial for 5000 beds complete is always kept 
up for these establishments in the depots at 
Bern and Lucerne. The transport of sick 
from the field establishments to the perma- 
nent hospitals is effected by the five trans- 
port columns furnished by the "Landwehr," 
ordinary railway trains, sanitary trains, steam 
vessels, and the medical service of the lines 
of communication. 

With regard to the private medical attend- 
ance of sick and wounded, special permission 
of the Chief Medical Officer is required, and 
men so treated, as a rule, waive all claims to 
indemnity, etc. 

The actual working of the Sanitary Ser- 
vice on the field of battle is as follows: In 
the case of a single regiment of infantry, say 
2332 all ranks, each company during the ad- 
vance is accompanied by its bearers, in the 
firing line. The medical portion of the staff 
of each battalion (consisting of two medical 
officers, two non-commissioned officers, two 
hospital attendants, and twelve bearers) re- 
mains in the rear and joins that of the other 
two battalions to form a regimental sanitary 
column, which thus becomes an independent 
unit, under the orders of the senior medical 
officer, who posts his detachment, now fifty- 
four strong (including the five other medical 
officers) in rear of the regiment, and follows 
it according to the direction of the Regi- 
mental Commander. The corps sanitary 



material in the battalion "fourgon," coi 
ing of eight stretchers per battalion, and the 
medical knapsacks and dressing-bags, are 
taken out and carried by the bearers in turn. 
As soon as the regiment becomes seriously 
engaged, the Regimental Medical Officer 
organizes his column as follows: Bearers are 
sent to the front in squads under the non- 
commissioned officers, forming patrols to 
search for, and relays to bring in, the 
wounded; and the first line dressing-station 
is established at a place selected or approved 
by the Regimental Commander, say 900 to 
1 100 yards in rear of the principal line of 
combat, or nearer if there is cover. If pos- 
sible the troops will be informed of the posi- 
tion of this station, and it will be marked by 
waving flags or fixing red lanterns. 

The non-commissioned officers in charge 
of the searching squads carry small horns 
for the purpose of signaling to their men. 
The detachment is then divided into groups: 
First, for the reception and sorting of the 
wounded (when a tag showing the nature of 
the casualty is affixed to the wounded man, 
after which he is carried to one of the follow- 
ing groups): Second, operating group, by 
which urgently required operations are exe- 
cuted: Third, group for treatment of wounded 
and those who have been operated upon, pre- 
paring them for removal to the ambulances, 
bandaging, applying splints, etc.: Fourth, 
group for the slightly wounded, who will be 
treated at leisure: Fifth, group for receiving 
the dead and dying, with which is the Regi- 
mental Chaplain. — It may be mentioned here 
that the antiseptic bandages provided for 
use in the field are carried by the medical 
officers and bearers in parchment paper en- 
velopes. It was at one time intended to pro- 
vide each man with a bandage, as in the 
German Army, but experiments in the field 
showed that these, if constantly carried on the 
person, soon deteriorated from dust and 
moisture, and were frequently put to other 
uses; detached parties, however, are to be 
supplied with packets when away from medi- 
cal assistance. 

Each of the five ambulances of a field hos- 
pital forms a complete mobile hospital, capa- 
ble of independent action in any position. 
The " fourgon " of each ambulance contains 
the necessary outfit for this purpose, with 






Til E MEDICAL AGE. 



drugs and appliances sufficient for forty pa- 
tients for two months, or for the treatment 
of 200 wounded after a battie; it also carries 
bedding for forty or fifty patients. The 

weive men sit- 
r six lying down. Further, the staff of 
the field hospital has in its two reserve " four- 
gons" sufficient bedding for eighty to one 
hundred men, with a store of drugs and hos- 
pital utensils, besides the sixteen requisitioned 
wagons before mentioned. Generally, one 
ambulance is employed to form the principal 
dressing-station for each brigade, the others 
being utilized in one of the various ways be- 
fore indicated, or kept in reserve to reinforce 
one or other of the two already in action. 
The ambulance for each brigade is estab- 
lished during an engagement two kilometers 
from the firing line, or one kilometer in rear 
of the centre of the first line of medical 
assistance. The approximate position will be 
indicated by the commanding officer (brigade 
or divisional) after the directing medical 
officer has offered his opinion. 

For the transmission of orders to the Chief 
of the Field Hospital or the chiefs of ambu- 
lances, the commanding medical officer is 
provided with mounted orderlies (guides or 
train non-commissioned officers). As soon 
as the ambulance is established, the senior 
medical officer sends his wagons for the 
wounded to the dressing-stations of the first 
line, so as to be ready to bring in those who 
may have already been received there, and 
divides his detachment into groups according 
to the facilities offered by the buildings or 
locality he has occupied. Usually these 
groups comprise: a receiving party, which will 
examine and classify the cases, passing them 
on to the other groups, and making out the 
admittance returns; a subsistence section, 
under the quartermaster, which undertakes 
all the duties connected with the messing of 
the establishment; a surgical section, which 
may further be divided into sub-sections for 
operations, setting of fractures, and simple 
dressing; a hospital section, dealing with the 
quarters and bedding of the wounded. The 
wounded and those operated upon who can- 
not be moved with safety will be provided for 
in this section, transportable cases requiring 
continued treatment being moved as soon as 
possible to the third line. If the establish- 



ment of the ambulance is not sufficient, it 
may be reinforced by one of the ambulances ;' 
kept in reserve, by order of the divisional 
medical officer. 

If the forces engaged continue to'advance, 
the ambulance must necessarily remain sta- 
tionary for some time, and one of the un- 
employed ambulances must follow up the 
troops, and similarly in case of retreat. 

The chief medical officer of the lines of 
communication, as soon as possible, de- 
spatches sections of the "Landwehr" trans- 
port columns, to insure the evacuation of the 
ambulances, and to organize the transport of 
convoys of wounded to the nearest "terminal 
stations;" or sanitary trains, etc., may be 
employed to remove the wounded towards 
the permanent hospitals. If, however, owing 
to the large number of untransportable sick, 
an ambulance cannot be evacuated for some 
time, it may form itself into a provisional 
field hospital; and the equipment has been 
carefully arranged with a view to this con- 
tingency. 

The regulations regarding voluntary aid 
in time of war provide that such assistance 
may take the form of personal help in nurs- 
ing, outside the immediate sphere of military 
operations, and in the transport of the sick 
and wounded, and also that of gifts of medi- 
cal comforts, etc.; but all such assistance 
must be organized under a responsible direc- 
tion and placed in all respects under the supreme 
military control. 

In addition to the medical officers serving 
with the troops, the Confederation has at its 
disposal in time of war the services of all 
medical men who are within the limit of age 
prescribed for the "Landsturm." It is 
specially provided that on a general mobili- 
zation, consulting surgeons may be nomi- 
nated by the Chief Medical Officer and called 
in to serve by the Military Department, 
which will fix the rate of pay to be granted 
them. They must be men of superior pro- 
fessional standing and may be placed at the 
disposal of the Principal Medical Officer of 
the Army, or employed in permanent hos- 
pitals. 

In 1880 a "Socieke' Militaire Sanitaire" 
was formed in Bern by the members of the 
Sanitary troops, its object being to promote 
improvement in the theory and practice of 



THE MEDICAL AGE.

[military sanitary art by means of lectures, 
etc. In the following year societies were 
I established in several other towns and a cen- 
tral committee was formed. Besides the 
mutual improvement of members, these soci- 
eties charged themselves with the formation 
of "Societes Suisse de la Croix Rouge," 
having as their object the providing of vol- 
untary aid for time of war, by educating the 
civil population in the art of giving first aid 
to the wounded. In 1882 a "Societe Cen- 
trale de la Croix Rouge" was formed, its aim 
being to organize the person?iel and material 
of the voluntary aid movement. In 1883 the 
central committee of the society, with which 
most of the local military societies had affil- 
iated as sections, was removed from Bern to 
Basle; and in 1885, the Military Department, 
recognizing the value of these organizations 
as a means of extending the knowledge of the 
members of the Sanitary troops of whom 
they were composed, commenced granting a 
small annual subsidy to the sections which 
had joined the central society. In 1886, on 
the initiative of the military sanitary socie- 
ties, several "Societes de Samaritains" were 
formed and instructed, after the model of 
the ambulance societies in England and Ger- 
many, their object being to enable their 
members (policemen, railway employes, and 
private individuals) to give "first help" in 
case of accidents of all kinds. In 1887 there 
were thirteen of these military sections, with 
274 members, affiliated with the central soci- 
ety, and most of the " Samantain " societies 
had amalgamated as societies of a central 
association, the Military Department grant- 
ing them also a small subsidy. In case of war 
it is foreseen that the latter societies could be 
utilized with great advantage, in rear of the 
army, to accompany convoys of sick on the 
road between detraining stations and the 
hospitals. 

Recapitulation. — The Sanitary Organiza- 
tions are composed of the sanitary personnel 
and the attached personnel* The former 
consists of the sanitary officers, military 
medical officers, military apothecary officers, 
sanitary non-commissioned officers and sol- 
dier's, non-commissioned officers, "infirmiers,"

"brancardiers" (litter-bearers); the latter of 
the necessary quartermasters furnished by 
the Administration troops, the chaplains, the 
second division of the train battalion of the 
"Landwehr" of the corresponding division 
as hospital train, the necessary "cadres" for 
the transport columns, and the personnel of 
the volunteer aid societies. 

In the distribution of the medical personnel 
there are attached to the Chief Medical ' » ni- 
cer in case of general mobilization, one sani- 
tary officer and his lieutenant (a lieutenant- 
colonel), one chief of the hospital service, a 
chief of the voluntary aid service, and one 
staff apothecary (a major): To the Staff of 
the Army— One medical director of the army 
(a colonel), two adjutants (majors or cap- 
tains), one staff secretary, two "infirmiers:" 
To the Commander-in-Chief of the lines of 
communication — One surgeon-in-chief of the 
lines of communication (lieutenant-colonel 
or major), one adjutant (captain or first lieu- 
tenant), one secretary. 

The Staff of the Army Corps is composed 
of one chief corps medical officer, whose staff 
will doubtless be about the same as that of 
the division medical officer. 

The Staff of a Division has one division 
medical officer (lieutenant-colonel), one adju- 
tant (captain or first lieutenant), one staff 
secretary, one "infirmier." 

The Staff of an Infantry Brigade: One 
brigade medical officer (major). 

The Staff of an Infantry Regiment: One

TAKA-DIASTASE. 

BY GEORGE SUTTIE, M.I). 

When I first contemplated making a report 
of cases in which this new amylolytic ferment 
was employed, I likewise intended to note the 
results accruing to certain laboratory tests 
made to verify, chemically, its claims. The 



. however, have been i ighM 

; uified in The . the 

Thetapeu; id other journals, that 

1 will confine myself to the clinical as] 
only remarking that I count , 
fully able- to perform all that has been as- 
serted for it in the way of digestion of starch. 



Cisr /. — Mrs. C 



suited me for a condition supp be due 

to inability to digest proteids. All : 

etc., had been forbidden except in 
moderate quantity, though no restrictions 
whatever were laid upon carbohydrates. She 
complained of excessive bloating, palpitation, 
fainting, and suffocating spells that came so 
frequently as to render her practically an 
invalid — when at her best she was unable to 
walk more than a block; had lost all appe- 
tite, and partook of food only because she 
deemed it essential — the distress after eating 
was such she feared to ingest more than a 
few bits of bread or potato at a time; chronic 
constipation was also one of the factors in 
her trouble. I reversed the character of 
nourishment advised, permitted her to eat 
meat, eggs, etc., but forbade starchy foods as 
completely as possible. The constipation 
received due attention, and in consequence 
three days later I found her much better but 
anxious to know when she would be able to 
partake of bread and potato again. The day 
previous I had the pleasure of an introduc- 
tion to Mr. Jokichi Takamine, the Japanese 
chemist, who was then in the city explaining 
the process of manufacture of his Taka- 
Diastase to Messrs. Parke, Davis &amp;: Co., and 
immediately bethought myself that Mrs. 

C would be an excellent patient upon 

whom to test the new ferment. Part of the 
sample I received from Mr. Takamine I gave 
to this lady, divided into twelve two-grain 
powders, at the same time withdrawing all 
restrictions as to the use of carbohydrates 
except as to the quantity to be taken the first 
day. As a result my patient became so much 
better that she expressed herself as being 
able thereafter to walk to my office, seven 
blocks away, should my services be again re 
quired. 

May 19th Mrs. C called to inform me 

she could "eat anything" — had "not felt so 
well for more than a year." There was no 
longer any bloating or palpitation, and she 
declared the new remedy had made her 
"heart better too." I discontinued the use 
of the ferment, prescribed a mixture contain- 
ing nux vomica, quinine, and cascara, and 
warned her to watch for any recurrence of 
the malady. 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 






May 29th she called to report continued 
improvement. Three months later I met her 
on the street, a mile from home, whither she 
had walked with perfect comfort. 

While it is possible the improvement in 
this case may have been due to the attention 
given to peristalsis, I am inclined to ascribe 
the greater benefit to the Taka-Diastase; and 
while I scarcely regard the ferment as cura- 
tive per se, it appeared, in this case at least, 
to tide the patient along for a period suffi- 
cient to allow recuperation of the natural 
functions. 

Case 2. — Stone-mason, aged 30 years, very 
much bronzed, but not apparently in need of 
medical care, informed me he was unable to 
retain food and was losing weight; for a 
number of days had been unable to work, 
and altogether was getting worse; for a long 
time had found it impossible to partake of 
fresh (and latterly even of stale) bread with- 
out great discomfort; had been under treat- 
ment at different hands for some weeks with- 
out benefit, and both he and his family feared 
he had become a victim of phthisis. I diag- 
nosed subacute gastritis with amylaceous 
dyspepsia, and ordered a mixture containing 
bismuth and nux vomica; also, to assist car- 
bohydrate digestion, twelve powders of Taka- 
Diastase, two grains each, to be taken after 
eating. I made no suggestions as to food, 
further than to indicate the quantity to be 
ingested during the first day or two. 

Four days later he reported himself stronger 
than for a long time, and intimated his pur- 
pose of looking for work; he was now able to 
eat bread, potatoes, etc., without bloating or 
any unpleasant accompaniment. Vomiting 
had ceased with the first dose of Taka- 
Diastase. 

It was in July that I saw this patient, and 
six weeks later I learned he could partake of 
almost any form of food, there having been 
no recurrence of the old trouble. 

I can account for this condition of perma- 
nent benefit from a few doses of Taka-Dia- 
stase only in the same way as with Case 1. 

Case j. — Mrs. R , six months pregnant, 

consulted me for stomach trouble; complain- 
ed of bloating after eating, with accompanying 
pressure symptoms. I ordered ten powders, 
two grains each, of Taka-Diastase alone, see- 
ing no occasion for medication other than to 
assist carbohydrate digestion. This secured 
permanent relief. I attended her in confine- 
ment three months later, and learned that she 
had had only one recurrence of the attack. 



Case 4. — Mrs. G , aged 40, complained 

of indigestion, bloating, a feeling of suffoca- 
tion, etc., after the evening meal, that could 
only be relieved by eructation induced by 
massage of the abdomen; likewise of general 
irritability ("nervousness"), which at night 
prevented from sleeping and at times from 
even assuming the recumbent posture, in- 
quiry elicited the fact that bread, potatoes 
and carbohydrates generally were to blame 
for these attacks, although there was likewise 
uterine irritation with resultant leucorrhoea. 
The latter received no attention at this time 
further than an alum douche. As I was un- 
able to secure Taka-Diastase, I resorted to 
other remedies, which gave temporary relief, 
and when they failed I was fortunately able 
to secure the ferment, which I prescribed in 
two-grain powders. These proved very sat- 
isfactory, or, as she expressed it, "did more 
good than any medicine she had ever taken." 

Two weeks later Mrs. G requested 

more Taka-Diastase, as the former symptoms 
had returned, and I was somewhat puzzled 
that the remedy had been so inefficient until 
I learned that her servant had suddenly left, 
throwing the entire work of the household 
upon her shoulders. There was evidently a 
neurasthenic element involved, and no amount 
of diastatic digestion appeared to be of service. 
Finally I returned to the older remedies with 
some benefit, only to abandon them again for 
Taka-Diastase — after a new servant had been 
installed. I regret to say I never secured as 
satisfactory results from the medicament in 
this case as those obtained under its first use 
— a fact I ascribe to contingent causes. 

Cases- — This was a patient of Doctor Var- 
ney's, 47 years of age, of nervous tempera- 
ment, who for some time had suffered from 
carbohydrate indigestion. He informed my 
colleague he had suffered from chronic fer- 
mentative dyspepsia for fifteen years, during 
which time he had been almost constantly 
under medical care but without permanent 
benefit. He was persuaded to try Taka- 
Diastase only because it was a new remedy, 
but was the reverse of hopeful as to results. 
Four grains given daily, directly after eating, 
secured marked improvement that was first 
manifested after the initial dose by disappear- 
ance of flatulence and distention. During 
the three weeks that the medicament was con- 
tinued, the patient was gradually eating new 
foods, things he had not dared to taste for 
years. At this writing he eats everything, 
from the simplest of starches to pastry and 
mince-pie, without being obliged to resort to 
artificial aids to digestion. 

My confrere declares that previous to tak-

three weeks endured no little misery from a 
reb Stomach; his meals caused a sense 

of JS and oppression all the time, and 

on vari( sions emesis only could afford 

relief; at times was troubled with flatulence, 
though this was not a constant .symptom. I 
prescribed for him a dose of calomel, to be 
followed before meals by a bismuth mixture; 
Taka-Diastase to be taken immediately after 
eating. A week later lie announced himself 
"perfectly comfortable," and at the end of a 
month asked for more powders, as he feared 
a recurrence of his trouble. Me had unad- 
visedly renewed the bismuth mixture at the 
chemist's, but, deriving little benefit there- 
from, had concluded the powders were neces- 
sary. From this circumstance I was able to 
judge of the proper amount of credit due to 
Taka-Diastase; and incidentally noted that it 
might be wise for the physician to personally 
dispense medicaments he desires to test, 
thereby preventing unauthorized repetition. 
I have, as yet, had no opportunity to know of 
the results accruing to the second treatment. 

Case 7. — This was a patient of Doctor B. 
R. Shurly, to whom I am indebted for this 
report. The sufferer is a hopeless victim of 
phthisis, and was greatly troubled with rum- 
blings and eructations of gas, due to indiges- 
tion; with a view to alleviating the latter, 
Taka-Diastase was prescribed. Relief was 
almost instantaneous, and continued so long 
as the medicament was employed; but lat- 
terly the patient was removed to hospital, 
and further information is not available. 

Case 8. — Mrs. R , aged 25, suffered 

from amylaceous indigestion, with the usual 
bloating and compression symptoms; no com- 
plaint of other trouble. Taka-Diastase was 
prescribed, and, as I have not seen the lady 
since, I take it for granted she was at least 
benefited. 

besides the cases noted I have given the 
remedy in four others where no definite ir- 
regularities were complained of: One was a 
case of diarrhoea; one simply of biliousness; 
one of dysentery; and the fourth complained 



of aenrousnes night.

EMPYEMA OF THE KNEE.* 

BY WILLIAM L. RODMAN, A.M., M.l&gt;. 

About five years since, a tinner who was 1 
working on the top of a house fell off and 
wounded the left knee-joint. He did not 
think at the time that a foreign body had 
entered the joint, although the skin was 
penetrated. Doctor Corrigan attended the 
case for five days, when I was called in con- 
sultation. The patient had a very high 
temperature and great swelling about the 
knee-joint, which evidently contained a great 
deal of pus, hardly explicable by the fact of 
simple external traumatism. The man was 
sure nothing had gone into the joint, but 
was willing to undergo any treatment; there- 
fore a free incision was made into the joint, 
liberating not only a quart of pus, but a rusty 
headless nail which had been there for a 
week. The joint was irrigated every day for 
three weeks, afterward every other day. At 
this writing the patient has about as good a 
joint as he ever had. We feared anchylosis, 
for, in addition to the knee trouble, he had 
an extensive cellulitis extending from the 
middle third of the leg up to the hip; the in- 
flammation was so pronounced that I think 
practically all of the cellular tissue of 
the thigh was discharged through numer- 
ous openings which it became necessary to 
make. Indeed, there was no cellular tissue 
left, and the case is interesting from that 
standpoint, as it has always been question- 



Read before the Louisville Clinical Society. 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 






able whether or not cellular tissue ever so 
restores itself; some have claimed that the 
skin would adhere to the muscle and a great 
deal of trouble result. This case is a refuta- 
tion of that idea, as it conclusively proves 
the cellular tissue does restore itself, as evi- 
denced by the movement between the skin 
and the muscles. Numerous scars are left 
as evidence of the great number of incisions 
made to relieve the cellulitis. Two drainage 
tubes were introduced, making through-and- 
through drainage, and the joint was irrigated 
every day with a solution of zinc chloride. 
The articular ends of the bones had become 
considerably roughened, and had the case- 
been allowed to go on a few days longer 
there would have been no cartilage on the 
end of the bone. The limb was undoubtedly 
saved by prompt interference.

THE POT AND KETTLE OF IT. 

It is a mistake to accept the theories of 
enthusiasts, or the enunciations of impracti- 
cal, inexperienced medical men, as proven 
facts, and change the entire therapeutic 
method in obedience to a "fad." The his- 
tory of medicine is a history of "fads" with- 
out substantial basis, and this is the secret 
of the complaisance of the laity toward most 
arrant knavery. If the medical profession 
runs after charlatanism under the guise of 
science, little wonder the public at large 
patronize quackery dressed up as medical 
art. Matteism is no worse than Kochism, 
Pasteurism, Bheringism, and not nearly so 
dangerous. 



PATHOLOGY OF EXOPHTHALMIC GOITRE. 

Doctor Reinhold, in the Munchener Medi- 
cinische Wochenschrift, expresses the opinion 
the seat of the malady is in the thyroid gland. 
And this contention is apparently supported 
by clinical experience, as a recent writer (in 
the Philadelphia Medical and Surgical Re- 
porter) calls attention to the fact that a large 
number of cases of Basedow's or Graves's 
disease develop from simple goitre. He re- 
marks that among thirty cases of exophthal- 
mic goitre he never yet observed the thyroid 
gland free from disease and enlargement.

DEATH FROn RUPTURE OF THE SPLENIC 
ARTERY. 

Editor Medical Age: 

The evening of August 22d I was called to 
see a lady, thirty-six years of age, who had 
always enjoyed the best of health, but was 
now suffering severe pain over the fourth 
intercostal nerve; pulse 80; temperature 99 . 
Father died from valvular disease of the 
heart; mother from diabetes. 

She had vomited once — after a very hearty 
supper; and as I could discover no serious 
trouble she was given a hypodermatic injec- 
tion of one-eighth grain of morphine with 
one-two-hundredth grain atropine; also, a 
hot-water bag was ordered to painful part. 

The succeeding day she was apparently 
better, and I then prescribed arsenite of 
soda, and left morphine in case pain should 
again become agonizing. The second morn- 
ing (the 24th) she apparently felt quite well; 
had rested nicely during the night; no pain; 
indeed, was so well I dismissed her, with 
directions to keep quiet, and to take arsenite 
of soda three times daily for a few days. 

About noon of this day, and while lying in 
bed, she called to the servant, declaring she 
was suffering great pain in the side, was very 
faint, and feared she was dying. Five min- 
utes later she was dead. 

As I was out of town I did not see her until 
two hours after her demise. I requested a 
post-mortem, which was readily granted. 

She was a very large woman, with consid- 
erable adipose; and when the peritoneal cavity 
was opened a great quantity of blood poured 
out — ten pints by measure, besides what was 
lost. I examined carefully every organ ex- 
cept the brain, finding no pathological changes 
save in the spleen, and a slight enlargement 
without degenerative change in the liver. In 
attempting to remove the former organ it 
broke down under touch, very much as would 
a blood clot; there were spots of softening as 
large as a silver half-dollar, and the organ as 
a whole was in a badly degenerate state. 
Nevertheless there was no pus, no cavities. 
or other evidence of abscess. There were, 
however, two aneurysms of the splenic artery 
about half an inch apart, close to where the 
artery entered the organ, and at this point 
rupture had occurred, which was the cause of 
the internal haemorrhage that culminated in 
death. 

I gave very close examination to the heart, 
kidneys, liver, and large blood-vessels, but,

M CLE1IN BXPERIENCB. 

I am becoming greatly interested in the 
new medicament Nuclein; have employed it 
: syphilitic anaemia, tubercular glands of 
and malarial intoxication with its re- 
sultant anaemia. 

The syphilitic patient had been under 
treatment tor constitutional syphilis for some 
eighteen months. The rigorous anti-syphi- 
litic treatment, plus the malady itself, caused 
him to become very anaemic— in fact (to ex- 
press myself more emphatically) malignantly 
so. I made use of various stimulating tonics 
advised and followed by the profession in 
general, without any success. Then I secured 
a supply of Nuclein, which, having thoroughly 
acquainted myself with the literature on the 
subject, I commenced to use. — By way of 
parenthesis I may say I have followed the 
method as directed by Professor Vaughan in 
every detail, and can only repeat his already 
given precaution — of using strict asepsis in 
giving the injections. 

At the end of sixty days I found my pa- 
tient had entirely regained his normal condi- 
tion; he now slept well, had gained some 
twenty pounds in flesh, and, to use his ex- 
pression, " Never felt better." 

My next case was one of tubercular degen- 
eration of glands of neck; there was not a 
gland element in this region that was not 
involved, hence surgical interference was im- 
possible. This case was also seen by my 
colleague, Doctor C. H. Grimm, who was 
astonished at the great amount of destruction 
going on. The collateral symptoms of this 
condition are so common and so well under- 
stood, I refrain from detailing them. 

This patient has received at my hand ioo 
injections of Nuclein, with the result that his 
appetite has become normal, he has gained 
fourteen pounds in flesh, the general cachexia 
has disappeared, the glandular lesions are 
vanishing — in fact, the sum total of his pres- 
ent condition is that he is practically a new 
individual. 

Mrs. , from Louisiana, consulted me 

regarding her general health, and I found 
her suffering from enlarged spleen. There 
was marked malarial cachexia, general an- 
aemia, murmur at base of heart, general lack 



of appetite, and certain stomachic distur 
bancea attributed to "dyspepsia. " 1 tried 
the usual [ iron, digitalis, strychnine,

using Nuclein, and after some twenty 
tme much improved. To- 
day her i has almost disappe 
appetite has returned; sin 
pounds in flesh, and thinks she 
" The New Woman" 

From these thn I am highly im- 

pressed with the therapeutic and physi 
value of the new medicament, and cannot too 
highly commend its discoverer for the boon he 
has conferred upon the profession especially, 
as well as upon suffering humanity at large.

TAKA-DIASTA5E IN THE TREATMENT OF 
DYSPEPSIA. 

Editor Medical Age: 

Diastase dissolves the starchy substances | 
which make up a large and important part of I 
ordinary food, and transforms it into a 
lable dextrin and maltose. The new Taka- , 
Diastase has properties similar to the ptyalin j 
of saliva and the amylopsin of pancreatic ] 
juice; by its aid the digestion and assimila- 
tion of starchy food becomes an easy matter, j 
not only in infants and the aged, but in con- I 
valescents; and even in normal digestion it | 
is of value, because we consume a larger 
quantity of food, as a rule, than the body 
demands, and the digestive apparatus is thus 
overtaxed. 

Taka-Diastase when administered in dry 
powder is far more reliable and efficient than 
when given in solution. Diastase is mate- 
rially injured by the means employed to make 
and keep a stable solution thereof. 

The first act of digestion is that performed 
by the saliva, whereby starch is turned into 
maltose. Nature intends all food to be 
thoroughly impregnated with saliva and its 
ptyalin, and this must be done by thorough 
mastication. The stomach has also to do 
with the digestion of the starch at first. Now 
where there is faulty digestion of starch foods, 
dyspepsia, so-called, supervenes; ami when 
an individual becomes the subject of this 
hydra-headed monster, more suffering and 
trouble result than ever sprang from l&gt; Pan- 
dora's Box." Here Taka- Diastase meel 
the requirements by ensuring complete diges- 
tion. In my hands it has proved a wonder- 
fullv satisfactory agent.

Editorial 



WORTHY OF TRIAL. 

The securing of proper safeguards about 
the retail liquor traffic has long been a qucestio 
vexata. Recently the New York Medical Times 
offered the suggestion that New York City- 
adopt the law peculiar to Denmark, which 
requires the police, if they find a drunken 
man on the street, to summon a carriage, 
place the unfortunate inside, drive him to 
the police station, and there detain him until 
fairly sober; then to drive him home. He is 
never out of police charge until he is safe with 
his family. The charges of the cabman, of 
the police surgeon, and of the police office, are 
then combined in a bill which is presented 
by an official of the Police Bureau to the 
proprietor of the establishment where the 
intoxicated individual received his last and 
overpowering glass; and the payment of this 
bill is rigidly enforced. 

The Times remarks " this system works 
well in Copenhagen," and seems to think it 
would be much more easily enforced than 
any of the excise laws existing in the United 
States, besides being productive of the great- 
est amount of good. 

The idea is certainly worthy of further con- 
sideration. If it can be made to work suc- 
cessfully in a city as large as the capital of 
Denmark, there certainly is no reason why it 
should not be equally effective in smaller 
towns. Its application in the United States 
would have a restraining influence upon the 
liquor-seller, and render him cautious how 
he dispensed to those unfit to receive. It 
would likewise have a tendency to crowd out 



of business the class of saloon-keepers that 
now predominate— a class utterly regardless 
of any obligation, either legal or moral. 

Another desideratum appears to be the 
strict enforcement of laws that will prevent 
licenses being issued to irresponsible parties. 
There should also be authority to revoke 
licenses for cause. When straw bonds can 
be done away with, and the rule enforced 
that no person interested in the sale of liquor 
can appear upon the bond of another spirit 
merchant, then and then only can it be ex- 
pected that the traffic will be brought within 
honest and legitimate channels. The addi- 
tion of the Denmark law, if it can be en- 
forced, certainly would be desirable and tend 
to overcome that greed which allows men to 
sell intoxicating beverages to individuals who 
are already far gone under the influence of 

spirits.

The sole " editorial " deals with the session 
of the American Medical Association at St. 
Louis, Mo., the month before, and this is 
supplemented by a very complete account of 
the proceedings under the caption of " Re-

Medical Science " appears a very compre- 
hensive abstract from the Edinburgh Monthly 
Journal of Medical Science on "The Diag- 
nostic Value of the Absence of Chlorides 
from the Urine." 

The advertising columns are no less inter- 
esting. First appears a notice of "Homoeop- 
athy, its Tenets and Tendencies, Theoretical, 
Theological, and Therapeutical," by Sir 
James Y. Simpson, M.D., F.R.S., followed by 
" Homoeopathy Fairly Represented — A Reply

The Castleton (Vermont) Medical College 
and the Albany Medical School offered "two

Taken as a whole, advertisements included, 
this old journal compares most favorably 
with the best publications of to-day. In 
'literary character, originality, practicability, 
and cleanliness of advertisements—indeed, 
in all that goes to make' up a first-class 
periodical — it is doubtful if an equal can be 
found in the English language at the present 
day. There are no proprietaries, patents or 
misleading synthetics mentioned; no editor- 
ial laudations of nostrums; and its pages 
are not sullied by the contributions of tyros 
and novices assuming the role of "authority" 
while retailing second-hand the immature 
observations of their equally ignorant pre- 
decessors. Indeed, medical journalism as a 
part of literature appears to be rapidly be- 



coming a "lost art," and just at present 
the main posing as a most subservient tool 
of the charlatan and nostrum-monger. 



EVIL LEGISLATION. 

The Assembly of the State of New York 
has before it a bill to make permanent pro- 
vision for the treatment of persons supposed 
to have been bitten by rabid animals, or in 
danger of infection with rabies, at a so-called 
Pasteur Institute. This is part of the per- 
nicious system of State medicine which, if 
carried out in all the phases that have been 
proposed in the past few years, will eventu- 
ally farm out the care of the ill to practition- 
ers with a "political pull." 

There has never been any evidence ad- 
duced to prove that Pasteurism has ever pre- 
vented the development of a single case of 
hydrophobia. More than that, neither Pas- 
teur or any one else has given any evidence 
as to what hydrophobia is. Indeed, the pith 
of the measure introduced into the New York 
Assembly appears to be the support of an in- 
stitution that is not needed, and whose bene- 
fits accrue only to one individual — its founder.

Docktag.— 

Last year one hundred and two well defined 
cases of lockjaw were reported to the I 
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani- 
lon, with a certificate in each case 
from the attending veterinarian that the 
malady resulted from docking; and one 
single veterinarian stated that out of thirty- 
one cases of tetanus which he had been called 
to attend within a year, twenty-seven had 
resulted from this same brutal custom. 

In the interest of humanity, every medical 
man should put himself on record as opposed 
to such mutilation of the "noblest of ani- 
mals." 

Homoeopathy in Hexico.— 

We have recently been favored with an 
exchange, published in the City of Mexico, 
entitled La Homaopatica. 

It is only within a few years that homoe- 
opathy has been recognized in the sister re- 
public, and less than thirty months since the 
first homoeopathic hospital was inaugurated 
under the special protection of President 
Diaz. According to a report recently issued, 
this hospital has treated 40,000 patients since 
its establishment, and it is expected the num- 
ber during the current year will reach two- 
thirds this figure. 

The Montreal Medical Journal.— 

Our contemporary, the Montreal Medical 
Journal, appears in a new, improved and. 
enlarged form, that will undoubtedly be ap- 
preciated. The price has likewise been ad- 
vanced, but the advantages anticipated will 
abundantly indemnify its patrons. We wish 
the Journal a continuation of the success it 
has so justly achieved. 

American Public Health Association.— 

This well known organization will hold its 
twenty-third annual meeting in Denver, Col- 
orado, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and 
Friday, October 1st to 4th. It is expected 
one-and-a-third-fare rates will be granted by 
the railroads for the round trip. 






THE MEDICAL AGE. 






Items and News, 



A Curious Phenomenon in Ornithology. — 

Many curious observations have been made 
with respect to the voracity of certain birds, 
as also to the combats which they are at 
times obliged to sustain with the different 
animals chosen for their subsistence. The 
following case is extraordinary: 

During May last a friend, in plucking some 
young starlings which he had removed from 
a nest placed in an old wall, was greatly sur- 
prised to find that one had its stomach per- 
forated by a lizard, of which the entire 
middle of the body adhered closely to the 
viscera. Considering such a phenomenon 
worthy of note, he had the kindness to per- 
mit us to examine it, and it would seem to 
be one of the rarest pathological freaks ever 
encountered. The bird was perhaps six or 
seven weeks old; the oesophagus as wide as 
a little goose-feather, with no apparent altera- 
tion; the stomach (or gizzard rather), of the 
dimensions of a pigeon's egg, but toward its 
left portion and a little toward the posterior 
part was a circular opening of forty milli- 
meters which gave passage to the anterior 
half of the gray lizard's body, about which 
was fastened the mucous membrane of the 
gizzard over an expanse of three to six milli- 
meters. The intestinal mass presented noth- 
ing peculiar and contained only the residue 
of the digested substances. 

The lizard presented the ventral portion of 
its body extending forward, and measured 
five centimeters from the cephalic to the part 
strangulated by the stomach of the bird; the 
forward feet were elevated. The skin had 
conserved its normal characteristics. The 
circumference of the body at its emergence 
from the stomach was forty-three millimeters, 
at the middle fifty-three millimeters, and 
near the head twenty- eight millimeters, the 
posterior portion comprising the hind feet; 
the tail had completely disappeared. This 
lizard must apparently have measured fifteen 
centimeters in length. 

It may be supposed the lizard was seized 
by the bird, and not fancying this unexpected 
engulfing, and seeking to escape, worked a 
passage with the aid of its claws and teeth 
through the stomach of the imprudent star- 
ling; but, presently exhausted by its impotent 
efforts, compressed by the muscular contrac- 
tions of its narrow visceral prison, and fur- 
thermore deprived of air, it was forced to 
succumb. 

As for the starling, what a wretched quarter- 
hour it must have spent ! It is surprising it 
continued to live. Contrary to the caution 



which the pathological condition demanded, 
the unhappy bird still found means to digest 
the entire portion of its prey which could not 
escape. 

The case presents several points of v 
It shows first the extent to which the voracity 
of a young bird may go, the extreme elas- 
ticity of its oesophagus, and its dig&lt; 
powers. It is a proof of a vital resistance 
and reparative rapidity which are rarely 
found in any organism. Also it furnishes a 
remarkable example of the new species of 
epidermic graft, the production of which 
may be explained in the present case by the 
analogy existing between the horny nature 
of the mucous membrane of the bird's 
stomach and the shagreened skin of the 
lizard. Finally, quite apart from any scien- 
tific consideration, the case is one of the 
most curious and is certainly unique in the 
history of birds. — Nature. 

The Dark Side of Surgical Technique.— 

Professor George S. Shiels, of San Fran- 
cisco, read a timely paper before a late meet- 
ing of the California Academy of Medicine, 
calling attention to the reproach that asep- 
ticism is liable to bring upon true surgery 
and upon our fi?i-de-siecle surgeons. There is 
at present a tendency to ignore the fact that 
a combination of anatomist and trained hos- 
pital attendant does not by any means con- 
stitute all there is of a surgeon. The science 
and practice of surgery is giving way as a 
study to simple operative techniqne. One 
man will attend a few operations upon the 
abdomen in a New York, Philadelphia, or 
Baltimore school, watch the best masters, 
and, having carefully rehearsed the tech- 
nique, fall into the error of believing he has 
learned all there is of surgery, and that all he 
requires to render him a great success is a 
series of laparotomies, over which he will 
gloat with the delight of an Indian brave 
over a string of scalps; the desire for a 
rounding-out of a "series" often leading 
such a one to entirely overlook the individ- 
ual necessities or the nature of the case, which 
is then theatrically operated upon to its detri- 
ment and to the prostitution of surgery. As 
observed by Professor Shiels, more pathology 
and diagnosis should precede the superabun- 
dance of technique. — National Popular Re- 
view. 

How to Succeed as a Druggist.— 

"I noticed," said the druggist to his as 
ant, "that a gentleman came in with a pre- 
scription, and that you took it and gave him 
the stuff in about three minutes. What do 
you mean by that?" "It was only a little

The Care of the Aged.— 

When a man or woman passes seventy 
years of age, great care should be given to 
the conditions surrounding him or her for 
the prolonging of life. The vital forces are 
greatly enfeebled at that period of life, and 
the powers of resistance, in consequence of 
age, are the weakest. A man of three-score 
years and ten, and over, is like an old ma- 
chine that by proper care given to its condi- 
tion has been kept running many years, and 
is still able to do work, but its wheels and 
axles and pinions are much worn and are 
rickety, and if it should be pushed, even to a 
small extent, in excess of its diminished 
powers, it breaks down and cannot be re- 
paired, for every part of it is shattered. But 
if worked carefully and intelligently by a 
person who understands its condition and 
knows its capabilities, it can be kept in action 
a much longer time than would be possible 
if a careless engineer controlled it. In these 
fast times, however, it is generally not profita- 
ble to husband the resources of an old ma- 
chine. But this is not true as regards our 
old men and women. It is desirable to hold 
on to them as long as possible, and if we can 
succeed in prolonging their lives five or ten 
years, or more, it will greatly enhance our 
happiness. — Medical Re\ view. 

" Authority." — 

Abroad the question is, not whether a 
thing is true, but whether it emanates from 
"authority." The natural result of such a 
condition of affairs is that every possible 
effort is put forth to become an "authority." 



. a populous European centre, 
the wronj performed in 

tain pathological ocular condition, because it 

--hundreds of trusting patients were injured 

annually because no one dared to differ with 
this medical auto 

When such conditions obtain, medical 
progress must be slow and erring. To be- 
come an "authority," it is on J ary to 
secure notoriety— devise a ;. 
whether mistaken or not; d. i new 
microbe, whether it exists or not; or prepare 
some revolting animal preparation. 

Real progress is made by the man who 
puts self behind his work, who invest 
the premises of an argument before he sub- 
scribes to it. Students need to learn some- 
thing more practical concerning medical 
science than the colonization of bacteria or 
the decimation of the animal kingdom. — 
Medical Jh ief. 

Cimex Lectularius and Phthisis.— 

Parisian scientific circles are exercised 
over the discovery that bedbugs are active 
agents in the transmission of the bacillus of 
tuberculosis from one person to another. 
This should at once dispose of the use of the 
old clumsy wooden structure and favor the 
introduction of the iron bedstead. This dis- 
covery need not, however, prevent our mil- 
lionaire heiresses from consummating mar- 
riages with French counts and others of the 
old nobility, as the ample means that our 
American women carry over with them will 
enable them to send the escutcheoned four- 
posted old ancestral bedbuggy bedstead for- 
merly employed by the count to the second- 
hand store around the corner, while its place 
will be filled either by the polished brass or 
a white japanned iron bed-frame. — National 
Medical Review. 

Next will come the bacillus bedbugosis ! — 
North American Review. 

Pasteurism Rivaled.— 

"There is nothing new under the sun," 
said Solomon, and even Pasteurism was ante- 
dated in Soudan. Doctor Tonkin declares 
that in Kano, Haussa State, Western Soudan, 
when a person is bitten by a dog supposed 
to.be suffering from rabies, the offending 
animal is instantly caught, killed, and cut 
open, the liver taken out and slightly browned 
by being held to the fire, after which the 
whole ot the organ is eaten by the patient 
It is generally believed this prevents the on- 
set of the disease. It is interesting to notice 
the similarity which exists between this 
method and that of Pasteur; also to note 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 






that Parisian statistics show that the mor- 
tality from dog-bites is as great now or 
greater than before Pasteur opened his in- 
stitution. — Exchange. 

New Ethics.— 

I consult with all educated, scientific phy- 
sicians, whether they give big, medium, or 
small doses. And thus I have very often 
gained information very valuable to myself, 
as well as seen the sick relieved. All the 
various medical schools teach the same gen- 
eral truths in regard to anatomy, physiology, 
chemistry, surgery, and would also teach the 
same materia medica if they understood gen- 
eral materia medica; and they would teach 
the same great science of therapeutics if they 
would study broader views of scientific medi- 
cine. Physicians differ in regard to a few 
new remedies, but finally they investigate 
them and adopt them. — Doctor Joseph 
Adolphus. 

The Usual "Rot!"— 

An English temperance agitator, Miss Wes- 
ton, publishes in "Ashore and Afloat," under 
the caption of "A Drunkard's Brain — No 
Joke, but Awful Truth," a statement that at 
an inquest recently held upon a noted drunk- 
ard, on opening his skull "the odor of alco- 
hol that filled the room was sickening. One 
of the surgeons then struck a match and held 
it close to the head, and immediately a blue 
flame enveloped the whole of the exposed 
brain." Miss Weston seems to regard truth 
as a matter of slight importance compared 
to the virtue of total abstinence. — Medical 
Record. 

A Discovery? — 

The fact that animal tissues can be stimu- 
lated by gradually increasing doses of a poi- 
son until they fail to respond, is heralded to 
the world as a great discovery, which it is 
proposed to use as a basis in perfecting a 
therapeutic system. In other words, saturate 
the system with poison, so that if a man is 
exposed to disease his tissues can no longer 
take cognizance thereof. This is about as 
rational as keeping a man drunk all the time 
that he may not crave liquor. — Medical 
Brief. 

Death on the Bicycle. — 

A pharmacist of Dublin was cycling home- 
wards, and had just ridden up a very steep 
ascent, when he suddenly dismounted, blood 
pouring from his mouth and nose. He 
rushed into a chemist's shop, and was in the 
act of taking a bottle of medicine from a 



shelf behind the counter when he fell to the 
ground, and died almost immediately. The 
inquest showed the deceased's lungs had 
eral large cavities, caused by over-exertion. 
— Chemist and Druggist. 

Camphor Fiends.— 

The recent discovery, on the streets oi 
Louis, of a woman unconscious from the 
effects of an over-indulgence in camphor, has 
brought to light the fact that the habit, while 
a strange one, is by no means a rarity; a 
number of druggists and physicians testify 
to this. Camphor-eating is not so pronounced 
an evil as the excessive use of some other 
drugs, but it is nevertheless an existent evil. 
— North American Medical Review. 

A Rare Anomaly. — 

M. Pean, the French surgeon, lately per- 
formed a successful operation on a young 
girl who suffered from incontinence of urine, 
caused by the presence in her vagina of a 
supernumerary bladder and urethra. Cases 
of this description are extremely rare, and 
where they do occur it is rarer still to find 
them entirely amenable to art. — Provincial 
Medical Journal. 

An Economist. — 

"If you insist on knowing the truth. 
Madam," said the doctor, "your husband 
will not live twenty-four hours longer." 
"Good gracious!" ejaculated the broken- 
hearted but economical wife, k, and yet you 
have sent in medicine enough for five days."

A Free LANCE in a Far Land. By Herbert Comp- 
ton. Cloth; i6mo; pp. 373. Price, $1.00. The 
Cassell Publishing Co., New York. 

This is the most delightful work of fiction 
that has come under our eye for many 
months. It purports to be the account of 
"the singular fortunes of Selwyn Fyfeways, 
Esquire of Fyfeways Hall, in the County of 
Gloucester, for seven years a free adventurer 
of the Kingdom of Hindustan — the same 
abridged from the original papers and jour- 
nals of Mr. Fyfeways from certain traditions 
in his family." The volume is divided into 
three parts; in the first, young Mr. Fyfeways, 
who is a posthumous son, is cheated of his 
patrimony by his father's sister and her hus- 
band, who endeavor to secure the inheri- 



tance for their own offspring, and a 

therein by ing Jesuit pnesl. who per- 

formed the mania mony between Mr. 

Fyfeways* father and mother, and - 

ijuentlv robbed the latter of her wedding ring 

and man: nse, In a quarrel 

the priest and Mr. Fyi the former is 

stricken down, and the latter fearing he has 
committed murder runs away from home, 
falls into the hands of an ex-army 
and finally into the hands of crimps, who sell 
him to the "John Company" and he is 
shipped off to Hindustan to - a soldier. 

In the second book, feeling under no ob- 
ligations to a Company which has thus kid- 
napped him, Selwyn Fyfeways desert 
takes service under the Mahratta flag. I Ms- 
covering a plot against his life by his em- 
ployers, he takes his troops over to the 
service of Rana Bheem Sing, by whom he is 
eventually appointed governor of a province 
of Mundalgurh. As the Rana subsequently 
plots against him, Fyfeways throws off all 
allegiance and proclaims his province inde- 
pendent. Later he is defeated and taken 
prisoner by a General Tyger, an Englishman 
in the service of the Mahrattas, but in this 
officer he finds his old friend the sergeant with 
whom he left England, and who moreover 
proves to be a witness to his mother's mar- 
riage. The result is, of course, that he 
eventually returns home to find, after all, the 
plotting Jesuit priest alive. He is never able 
to establish his legitimacy, but purchases his 
patrimonial estate, which is sold under 
mortgage, obtains legal authority to keep 
the name, and marries his cousin Mercy Fyfe- 
ways. 

One cannot but note the similarity and 
sometimes parallelism of this work with 
"The Golden Bullets," by W. W. Ireland. 
The two volumes should be in every library, 
since there are probably no other works 
which give so full and clear an insight into 
life in India during the last century. 



Doctor Gray's Quest. By Francis H. Under- 
wood, LL.D. Cloih; 121110; pp. 406. Price, 
$1.75. Lee &amp; Shepard, Boston. 

This work will be gladly welcomed by all 
lovers of good books. It is not only a thought- 
ful and informing volume, but a work of 
fiction of unusual power. '\ ne character of 
Mercy Starkweather is admirably conceived, 
or, rather, observed — since it is a typical 
painting of New England character devel- 
oped with great ingenuity and judgment; 
indeed, a finer piece of delineation in this 
line is rare in English literature. The other 
characters win affection or inspire reproba- 
tion according to their development. 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 






The story of Doctor Gray and his search 
for proof of the innocence of Florian's father, 
has deep interest; and the domestic life of 
Little Canaan is another of those historic 
pictures of New England for which Mr. 
Underwood is famous. Altogether, the book 
takes first rank among modern works of 
fiction, and is well worthy of the reputation 
its learned author has already established as 
a delineator of old-time scenes and incidents, 
and of picturesque characters that are fast 
receding from the stage of life. 



Game Birds at Home. By Theodore S. Van Dyke. 
Cloth; i6mo; pp. 219. Price, $1.50. Fords, 
Howard &amp; Hulbert, New York. 

This elegantly gotten up little volume is 
fluent, lucid, and sparkling, in a style calcu- 
lated to fascinate not only the sportsman, 
but every lover of nature and outdoor life. 
The author portrays the skill of man, the 
sagacity of the dog, and the beauties of na- 
ture, along with the haunts and habits of the 
different species of game birds — grouse, colin, 
woodcock, plover, California quail, snipe, wild 
turkey, and the varied forms of water-fowl. 
Without being at all pretentious, the work 
covers a great deal of ground, and sustains 
the reader's interest throughout; it is bound 
in a most picturesque Nile-green cover, fitly 
ornamented, and is deserving of a place in 
every library. The graphic narratives and 
valuable hints that emanate from an experi- 
ence of forty years are possessed of untold 
value, not alone to the sportsman, but to the 
naturalist. Further, it is doubtful if any 
woman who loves the woods and fields and 
charms of animated nature can fail to find 
genuine inspiration and much fresh knowl- 
edge of outdoor beauty from Mr. Van Dyke's 
delightful brochure. 



Practical Dietetics. By W. Gilman Thompson, 
M.D. Cloth; 8vo; pp. 802. Price, $5.00. D. 
Appleton &amp; Co., New York. 

The subject to which this volume is de- 
voted has never received full or due atten- 
tion, either in text-books or at the hands 
of teachers; and, strange to say, even in 
hospitals and in schools for nurses it is 
practically ignored. This work, happily, in 
great measure rectifies these shortcomings, 
and furnishes the practitioner with a text- 
book replete with instructions as to the ap- 
propriate diet in disease and convalescence, 
and information regarding the influence of 
feeding upon physiology and pathology. 
Even the various methods of cooking food, 
and the adulteration, economic value and 
comparative nutritive properties of various ed- 



ibles, are discussed; the feeding of pregnant 
women, nursing mothers, infants and young 
children constitutes a very important part of 
the work, and an appendix affords receipts 
for invalid foods and beverages suitable for 
fevers and convalescence from acute maladies. 
The work is the result of careful and intel- 
ligent observation on the part of its author, 
and certainly occupies a* field in medical lit- 
erature hitherto practically untilled. 



Pathology and Morbid Anatomy. By T. Henry 
Green, M.D. Cloth; 8vo; pp. 595. Price, - 
Lea Brothers &amp; Co., Philadelphia. 

This work has long been a leading text- 
book for Anglo-Saxon practitioners and stu- 
dents — a fact indicated by the number of 
editions demanded. A knowledge of the 
subjects covered by its title is essential to 
every medical student, whether under- or 
post-graduate, since an understanding of 
disease is a prerequisite to rational thera- 
peutics. 

This is the seventh American, from the 
eighth and revised English edition, and pre- 
sents a number of new chapters, also some 
sixty new engravings. As a whole the work 
is one essential to every medical library, and 
possesses an especial advantage over works 
of its class in that it presents its topics in a 
terse manner calculated to be grasped by the 
memory with a minimum of labor. 



Male Sexual Disorders. By Eugene Fuller. M.D. 
Cloth; 8vo; pp. 23S. Price, $2. 00. Lea Brothers 
&amp; Co., Philadelphia. 

This work is Exceedingly J propos. From 
time immemorial the class of maladies of 
which it treats have been most lucrative to 
advertising charlatans, and it is a great satis- 
faction to find a work based on sound knowl- 
edge pitted against rank empirical methods. 
The author believes the majority of male 
sexual disorders more frequently arise from 
pathological than from neurological or men- 
tal causes, and he endeavors to place the lit- 
erature of sexual pathology on a par with 
that of sexual neurology, and to deal with 
the aetiological factors in their order of real 
importance. The volume will prove of su- 
perlative value to the practitioner. 



Senator Intrigue and Inspector Noseby. By 
Francis Campbell Sparhawk. Cloth; i6mo; pp. 
162. Price, $1.00. Red Letter Publishing Co..

An evidence of the popularity of this work 
is given by the fact that it is now in its

This is a complete compendium of single 
and compound medical words and terms, 
along with dialogues, idiomatic phrases, prov- 
erbs, etc., in both the German and English 
tongues, for the especial use of physicians 
and medical students. The result is a very 
convenient manual, one that is of prime 
ssity to every practitioner who is not 
familiar with the Teutonic language and who 
is apt to come in contact with Germans. For 
accurate and convenient reference there has 
been added a complete schedule of German 
declensions and irregular verbs. It is the 
most practical book that has been offered in 
recent years looking to convenience in com- 
municating with those Germans whose knowl- 
edge of English is deficient and obscure. 



Text-hook of Practical Therapeutics. By Ho- 
bart A. Hare. M.D. Cloth; Svo; pp.800. Price, 
$3.75. Lea Brothers &amp; Co., Philadelphia. 

Five editions in as many years constitute a 
remarkable record for any book. The reason 
for the popularity of this particular text-book 
on therapeutics is doubtless to be found in 
the author's original and ingenious mode of 
conveying practical knowledge. Possessing 
a complete acquaintance with drugs and their 
remedial virtues, and having abundant clini- 
cal opportunities, Doctor Hare has made of 
this volume a treatise in which the properties 
of the materia medica are closely linked with 
therapeutical application.

The aim of the author is, apparently: First, 
to give his own experience as an opium hab- 
itue during a period of nine years: Second, to 
refute much of what appears in the confes- 
sions of De Quincy: Third, to enlighten his 



rdins opium, to point out the 
dangers ol its indiscriminate use, and to plead 
foral gulation for its sale: Fina

Strength. By C. A. Sampson. Paper; i6moj 

pp. 240. Price, 25 cents. Rand, McNally &amp;

The author purports to put forth a treatise 
on the development and use of the muscles, 
but the work seems chiefly devoted to puffing 
its author as "the strongest man on earth." 
While the book contains considerable matter 
of material interest, its value as a scientific 
publication is somewhat problematical.

It is claimed for this work that the author 
has attempted to systematize his subject. 
He certainly has succeeded in producing a 
somewhat ponderous volume, the practical 
utility of which may be left to the judgment 
of the individual reader.

This work is an examination into the oc-

numerous cases in which the evidences of

historical.

Therapeutic Brevities, 



Notes on Nuclein. — My first case was one 
of chronic alcoholism of many years' dura- 
tion, with chronic rheumatism; an acute 
rheumatism came on with a temperature of 
104 , and the patient seemed about to die. 
When comatose and unable to swallow, Nu- 
clein injections three hours apart restored 
him, and he ultimately recovered. The next 
case was a neurasthenic woman, confined to 
bed for many months; Nuclein and arseniate 
of strychnine restored her to health. A 
woman of 35 had suffered from " nervous 
prostration " for fifteen years, insomnia being 
the chief symptom; under Nuclein she im- 
proved greatly but was not cured. A case of 
chronic catarrhal bronchitis — following la 
grippe — weak and prostrated, with severe 
cough, failed to improve under Nuclein. A 
woman who had la grippe followed by chronic 
bronchitis, general malaise and great weak- 
ness, who did not improve on opium and ex- 
pectorants, got well under Nuclein, although 
there is still dullness over the apex of one 
lung. A child of six years, while convalescing 
from scarlet fever, "took cold;" temperature 
102 ; swelling of wrists and glands; some 
albuminuria. She was given, every four 
hours, Nuclein and digitalis, with the result 
the symptoms quickly disappeared and the 
urine resumed a normal specific gravity. 
Another case was one of suppurative tonsil- 
litis with profound weakness, that appeared 
about to die; it also recovered under Nuclein. 
The eighth case was a boy of eight years, 
similarly affected, and the result was the 
same. — Doctor Baskett, before the Mis- 
souri Medical Association. 



Ethyl Iodide. — We again desire to impress 
upon professional attention the great use- 
fulness of this much neglected drug. Its 
extreme volatility renders its inhalation a 
simple matter. All that is necessary is for 
the patient to take the unstoppered vial in 
his hand, hold it to his nose or mouth, and 
inspire. Inhalation may be continued from 
two to five minutes, according to the effect 
produced, vertigo being the indication for its 
cessation. In the treatment of pulmonary 
and laryngeal tuberculosis, in syphilis of the 
air-passages, and in some cases of constitu- 
tional syphilis, it affords a ready means of 
local and systematic medication with iodine. 
It is an antiseptic of considerable power, and 
as such has been utilized in the treatment of 
acute pneumonia. In the relief of asthma, 
and especially of the asthma associated with 



hay fever, it is very often effectual; for the 
latter purpose it may be combined with ether 
or chloroform when necessary. Care should 
be taken to get a pure preparation. The 
drug should be dispensed in amber colored 
bottles, with glass stoppers. When amber 
bottles cannot be obtained, the vial contain- 
ing the drug should be wrapped in black pa- 
per. It should be kept in a cool place. The 
development of a brown color, showing the 
presence of free iodine, indicates that the 
preparation has become decomposed and is 
no longer suitable for use by inhalation. — 
Philadelphia Polyclinic. 



Cocillana. — I find the action of this drug 
to be of decidedly expectorant nature. The 
pulmonary secretion is, in all cases, much 
increased, and the strength of the cough like- 
wise; even when used in health a distressing 
cough is often the result. Nasal secretion is 
likewise stimulated and sneezing often in- 
duced. In a few cases I have observed head- 
ache, which on some occasions amounts to 
little more than a fullness, and this I regard 
as rather a drawback to the use of the drug 
for any length of time; nevertheless the pain 
is not severe and may be easily relieved by 
other means. The slightly laxative action of 
Cocillana is very much in its favor and may 
greatly increase its value, since other expec- 
torants do not have this property — at least 
not so well marked. The pulmonary secre- 
tion is stimulated to such an extent that I 
am exceedingly careful about giving in cap- 
illary bronchitis and pneumonia, but in all 
cases where secretion is defective and the 
cough hard and dry it acts much better than 
any known drug of the expectorant class. I 
have given it with great benefit in the lar- 
yngitis of both children and adults, and have 
thus far failed to observe any depressing 
action upon the heart. On the whole I con- 
sider Cocillana an expectorant of the greatest 
value, and particularly successful in its own 
more direct sphere. — David Crici 
L.R.C.P. (Edin.), Walthamstow, Essex, Eng- 
land. 



Anesthetization Accidents. — The accidents 
to be avoided with chloroform are primary 
(or laryngo-reflex) and secondary (or bulbar) 
cardiac syncope. Atropine and morphine 
may be employed to prevent the first, and by 
so doing the inhibitory action of the pneumo- 
gastric nerve upon the heart is diminished. 
Sparteine sulphate, hypodermatically, along 
with morphine, before administering chloro- 
form, regulates the heart and diminishes the 
excitability of the pneumogastric. Half a

I to a prolonged operation the heart 
will usually remain Steady. As regards pri- 
mary syncope, the part played by sparteine 
is of small consequence; it is a tonic and reg- 
ulator of the heart, acting rather against sec- 
ondary syncope; morphine, on the contrary, 
diminishes the danger of primary syncope. — 
Journal des Practiciens. 



Shepherd's Purse and Uric Acid. — I have 
seen several cases corroborative of the medi- 
cinal virtue of Capsella bursa-pastoris. For 
one gentleman, aged 57, who, in addition to 
other dyspeptic symptoms, had occasionally 
large discharges of coarse uric acid, coming 
away in masses the size of a good big pin- 
head, but, curiously enough, without pain, I 
prescribed this medicament, with charming 
results. Nearly a year later he informed 
me the uric acid had reappeared several 
times, but that a few doses of the Capsella 
soon stopped it. A lady, 80 years of age, 
suffered from calculus in the left ureter, 
which I knew to be of uric acid, as she had 
previously passed much "sand." It was not 
until I gave Capsella that a great discharge 
of coarse, brick-colored sand took place, with 
speedy relief to her pains; at the same time 
she drank copiously of distilled water, which 
sometimes has a powerful disintegrating 
effect on uric acid. The ancient use of this 
drug as a haemostatic has been confirmed in 
modern times, and in my own experience. — 
Doctor Dudgi on, in Homoeopathic News, 



Taka- Diastase versus Malt Extract. — .The 
new Japanese discovery is able to convert at 
least one hundred times its weight of dry 
starch under proper tests. It is absolutely 
permanent; is concentrated in form, requiring 
doses of not more than five grains, and, being 
an isolated ferment, is free from sugar. Thus 
Taka- Diastase is economical owing to small 
dosage, and withal it is perfectly soluble and 
compatible with other medicaments in neutral 
or but slightly alkaline media.

ium Chloride as a Hemostatic. — Since 
Wright demonstrated that Calcium Clc 
increases the coagulability of the blood, this 
drug has been used in the treatment of 
aneurysm, in efforts to check the haemoptysis 
of pulmonary tuberculosis, in the haematem- 
esis of gastric ulcer, effusions of purpura and 
scurvy, and the bleeding of haemophilia. It 
must not be forgotten that while the first 
effect is to increase coagulability, the long- 
continued use of the drug tends rather to 
diminish coagulability; it is best, therefore, 
to give a large quantity in the beginning, say 
from ten to thirty grains at a time, the 
smaller dose repeated as often as every two 
hours, the larger not oftener than three times 
daily — and then to gradually diminish, inter- 
mitting at the end of two or three days. In 
acute cases there may be no occasion to re- 
sume, but in long-continued treatment, such 
as that of aneurysm, it might be well to give 
for two or three days in each week; clinical 
experience will be necessary to determine 
this point. — Philadelphia Polyclinic. 



Hepatic Colic. — Salicylate of sodium is a 
cholagogue which produces an abundant 
biliary flux; in many painful cases, where 
the kidneys are sound, good results may be 
obtained from this agent. The same may be 
said of chloroform and ether, both of which 
can give by reflex action a considerable in- 
crease in the biliary secretion. Calomel, so 
frequently employed as a purgative in he- 
patic colic, deserves special mention; this 
salt not only acts in an indirect way on the 
liver in provoking an increased secretion, 
but also as a direct stimulant on the hepatic 
cell. Mercury salts — more, perhaps, than 
any of the other metallic salts— are arrested 
in the liver, producing by accumulation the 
stimulating action which gives to calomel the 
properties of a cholagogue so universally 
admitted. — Wiener Medicinische Wochen- 
schrift. 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 






Oil of Cajeput in Pneumonia. — Cajeput has 
been known as a good diffusible stimulant 
and sudorific for more than two centuries, 
and it long enjoyed reputation as a remedy 
for epilepsy. In 1861 M. Delvaux recom- 
mended Cajeput for chronic affections of the 
respiratory organs, claiming that it led "to 
diminution of the dyspnoea and cough, and 
an easier expectoration." During the recent 
epidemic 6f influenza in Dublin, Doctor 
George Foy used Cajeput oil as a diffusible 
stimulant in asthenic pneumonia, for which 
he thinks it particularly suited. It is as quick 
and powerful a cardiac stimulant as alcohol 
or ether, and, like them, relieves the heart by 
dilating the systemic arterioles; but, unlike 
either, it does not diminish sensitiveness of 
the respiratory centres. He prescribes six- 
drop doses in mucilage, repeated at short 
intervals; and sometimes adds quinine and 
tincture of nux vomica. — Medical Press and 
Circular. 



Nuclein in Diphtheria. — At a meeting of the 
Society for Medical Progress of the New 
York West Side German Dispensary, held 
April 14th, Doctor William Jacobson read a 
paper on the use of Nuclein in the treatment 
of diphtheria and other contagious diseases. 
For the introduction of this agent, he said, 
the profession is indebted to Doctor Victor 
Vaughan. Out of 200 cases of diphtheria, 
scarlet fever, and measles, he claimed there 
had been only nine deaths, and in these the 
fatal result was due either to the fact the 
Nuclein injections were not made until the 
disease was too far advanced for any remedy 
to be of service, to necessarily fatal compli- 
cations, or to lack of proper care or other un- 
favorable conditions. — Medical and Surgical 
Journal. 



Onions in Therapeutics. — Doctor Stawski 
experimented for several days upon eight 
healthy persons in order to determine the 
effect of onions. About two ounces of the 
raw esculent were administered each day, 
along with mixed diet. The result gave no 
support to the claim that onions promote 
either diuresis or diaphoresis. In five of the 
eight cases there was increased body-weight. 
Appetite, thirst, eructation, peristalsis, and 
bodily vigor were augmented, the latter how- 
ever followed by a temporary inclination to 
somnolence. In general the faeces were made 
more soft, increased in quantity, and more 
easily evacuated. — Medical Standard. 



this kind, apparently under the most hope- 
less circumstances, when all other standard 
methods had failed, I have resorted to I 
dermatic injections of whiskey, with most 
satisfactory results. The amount us 
or six drops in first one arm and then the 
other, fifteen drops being the largest quantity 
used in a single case. If the mother has 
suffered alarming ante-partum hemorrhage, 
and the infant has been drained of blood 
before its birth, this method can avail noth- 
ing. — Doctor Bedford Brown, in American 
Journal of the Medical Sciences. 



Diphtheria. — Abundance of sunshine, the 
greatest of all purifying agents and germi- 
cides, good hygienic surroundings — absolute 
cleanliness indoors and out, internal and ex- 
ternal — are axioms, so to speak, which should 
form the basis of treatment in all cases. When 
the disease has appeared in any locality the 
whole population should be informed at the 
earliest possible moment, so that suitable 
precautionary steps may be taken to suppress 
the outbreak. The mouths and throats of

Potassium Bichromate. — This drug has a 
specific effect upon catarrh of the bronchi, 
both acute and chronic, and will be found of 
great benefit in catarrhal conditions of any of 
the mucous membranes. In gastric catarrh 
it acts admirably, especially if tenderness on 
pressure over the epigastrium is a marked 
symptom. In chronic gastric ulcer great 
confidence may be placed in it; a very small 
dose, from one-sixteenth to one-twelfth of a 
grain, given upon an empty stomach, will 
answer the purpose. This agent will well 
repay careful investigation, and is without 
doubt a most useful remedy. — Eclectic Medi-

Helonias for Pruritus Vulva. — Doctor I. L. 
Danforth reports a case that suffered for 
weeks with intense pruritus, both vulvar and 
vaginal; the labia and skin adjoining were 
red and swollen, as was also the vaginal 
mucous membrane which in addition was 
covered with thin, white, curdy dep&lt; 
also pouring from a congested cervix was a 
thin, albuminous leucorrhcea, which was un- 
questionably the cause of the pruritus. The 
itching was intolerable. The woman was 
relieved speedily on the administration of 
Helonias. — North American Journal of Ho-

Neuralgia. — Hunsberger claims Aconite or 
Aconitine to be the remedy par excellence in 
this affection. Its action depends upon the 
physiological fact that it diminishes reflex 
activity by paralysis of both motor and sen- 
sory nerves, commencing at their peripheral 
endings, and that this action is most marked 
in the sensory nerve-endings. There is not 
another drug with which this action can be 
produced on the sensory nerve-endings with- 
out pushing it to the danger point. — Kansas 
Medical Journal. 



Ergot in Tabes Dorsalis. — In conversation 
with Charcot the subject of remedies in loco- 
motor ataxia was under consideration; in a 
general resume' relative to the unsatisfactory 
results of the usual measures, the Doctor, in a 
moment of enthusiasm, made the remark that 
the most satisfactory results are obtained 
from the internal use of Ergot because in its 
action upon the healthy nervous mechanism 
it has the most pronounced affinity for the 
sensory fibres. — Doctor Halbert, in The 
Clinique. 



Chloroform Asphyxia. — At the Gottingen

Medical Progress. 



Action of Morphine on Intestinal Peri- 
stalsis. — Among the first manifestations of 
the action of morphine after a hypodermatic 
injection, are the effects produced on the in- 
testine, resulting in one or two stools ere 
the phase of narcotism sets in (Picard). I 
have carefully observed these defecations, 
and noted that, as with the vomitings, they 
are not regular as to frequency, intensity, or 
duration; they do form, however, a habitual 
symptom which apparently is equally related 
to the dose and the rapidity of absorption, 
and they follow more surely as the result of 
administering small doses. That these defal- 
cations are due to a reawakening of intestinal 
peristalsis by the morphine, cannot be doubt- 
ed, despite the assertion made by certain 
authors that morphine produces immediate 
suspension of the activity of the digestive 
viscera. — It is easy to demonstrate the truth 
by registering (as I have done), with the aid 
of the conjugated ampulla, the movements of 
the intestine. To me it appears beyond 
doubt that in the dog morphine first excites 
intestinal movements; but it is not less certain 
that as the result of this first action the in- 
verse effect ensues, and that from the outset 
of the soporific phase these movements dis- 
appear and give place to the most complete 
inertia, which, joined to the suppression of 
the secretions, explains the constipating ef- 
fects of opium and morphine. This is con- 
firmed by several authors. 

Nothnagel and Rossbach may be num- 
bered among those who concede that before 
paralyzing the nerves of the intestine, mor- 
phine begins by exciting them as it ioes all 
the other nerves. Injecting twenty-fi /e milli- 
grammes of the medicament into the veins of 
a rabbit, Hasse and Gscheildlen observed that 
the movements became more rapid and intes- 
tinal excitability was exalted— the same as 
was observed in the dog. The human sub- 
ject also exhibits the original exciting action 
on the intestine, then rapidly the secondary 
depressing action. It is freely admitted that 
if the entire dose of morphine be given at 
once, the paralyzing action is immediate. 

The mechanism of this action is perhaps 
more complex than that of the nauseating 
and hypersecretory action of the same drug. 
I have good reasons for believing that the 
central phenomena are not dominant, and 
that the sympathetic ganglionic centres situ- 
ated at the periphery participate, in very 
great measure, in the production of the intes- 
tinal phenomena. The transient exaggera- 
tion of peristalsis is certainly analogous to 



that produced with greater intensity and du- 
ration by apocodeine,* the hypnotic effects of 
which, even in man, are preceded by con- 
stant intestinal symptoms; by chloral, whose 
anaesthetic sleep is always announced by 
noisy rumbling of the bowels; by amorphous 
apomorphine, etc. All these pharmacody- 
namic actions bear intimate relations which 
it would be wrong to neglect, for they pos- 
sess interest from various points of view. 

The effects of this medicament on the in- 
testinal functions of species other than the 
dog are identical with those just described 
— the dominant action in the horse, ox, pig, 
sheep and cat is intestinal inertia; and this 
fact, added to other experimental data in my 
possession, causes me to believe wholly in an 
action exerted by morphine on the motor 
peripheric elements of the abdominal viscera. 

The majority of nervines stimulate before 
paralyzing; so, it must be definitively ad- 
mitted, does morphine (in small doses) first 
excite the motor nervous centres of the un- 
striped muscular fibres before narcotizing 
them. 

The application of these observations may 
be found in the employment of morphine, as 
proposed by Kuppffer, in the treatment of 
insufficiency of uterine contractions. This 
author claims to have observed repeatedly 
that morphine, given in small doses, aug- 
ments the tonicity of the muscles and stimu- 
lates the contractions of the uterus. Such a 
result would be in perfect harmony with the 
facts which I have just stated, and with their 
physiological interpretation. — Doctor L. 
Guinard, in Lyon Medical. 



Digestion of Starchy Foods. — Notwith- 
standing the fact that starch is the most 
widely distributed and abundant of nutrients, 
and necessary to both animals and plants, it 
is strange that neither can assimilate it until 
it has undergone hydrolysis. This splitting- 
up of the starch by combining it with water 
is due almost entirely in plants, and wholly 
in animals, to the action of a diastase. In 
man there exists the further peculiarity, prob- 
ably acquired, that his diastasic fluids will 
not act on the starch unless it has been 
cooked; when ingested in this condition the 
starchy foods are, during the process of mas- 
tication, brought into contact with the sali- 
vary diastase called ptyalin, and this com- 
mences their conversion into dextrin and 
maltose. In the stomach this diastase con-

and with some 
and among certain classes the propor- 
tion is even greater. Among ordinary foods 
we may select as examples the following: 
potatoes contain 20 per cent, of starch, beans 
33 per cent., peas 37 per cent., oats 68 per 
cent., rice SS per cent., and flour is practically 
all starch. Are we then unreasonable in sav- 
ing that we probably overlook the greater 
source of digestive troubles in the starchy 
foods, in our efforts to assure the disintegra- 
tion of the fats and proteids? 

Instead of pepsin preparations, would it 
not be better to have a diastase pure and 
simple — one which occupies a small space; 
which will retain its activity in any climate; 
which is concentrated enough to cause a 
moderate dose to aid materially in the diges- 
tion of the bread, cakes and pastry which 
modern culinary development usually pre- 
sents to us in such a gummy, glutinous or 
compacted mass, or so permeated by grease, 
that the action of the diastasic fluids is 
greatly retarded ? Furthermore, such a dia- 
stase would free us from the trouble and ex- 
pense of handling bottles of fluid, and would 
enable us to place such a desirable anti-dys- 
peptic in the hands of the suffering thousands 
of tropical and semi-tropical climates, where 
the malt extract deteriorates so rapidly as to 
practically prohibit its employment. 

Can such a compound be prepared ? The 
history of pepsin is sufficient answer; such 
a substance, possessing a proteolytic power 
of 1 to 10,000, was beyond the dreams of 
the most sanguine fifteen years ago. Dia- 
stase has been prepared in an experimental 
way, one part of which would dissolve 50,000 
parts of starch. We do not hope for such a 
product on a practical scale as yet, but we 
may expect in the near future a diastase 
which will convert one hundred times its 
weight of starch. — Professor J. M. Francis, 
in Bulletin of Pharmacy.

Snake-Poison Antidotes. — The chemist 
of the laboratory attached to the office of th&lt; 
Sanitary Commissioner with the Government 
of India have concluded a series of experi- 
ments with snake venom. Several reme- 
dies investigated have been regarded more 
or less as antidotes, notably strychnine, 
"periodate crystals," and gold chloride; but 
results are not even favorable to the first of 
these, although it has attained to the reputa- 
tion of being reliable. Strychnine has been 
demonstrated to be quite useless to pr&lt; 
the paralysis of the lungs and other symp- 
toms which follow on the bite of the cobn 
while it has been found to have "no eUm 
whatever in preventing the occurrence of 
death even after minimal lethal doses of 
cobra venom have entered the system." So 
that it is probable that in cases which have 
been believed to be cured by strychnine in- 
jections the smallest fatal dose of the poison 
may not have entered the system of the 
patient. "Periodate crystals" have been 
vouched for by investigators in South Amer- 
ica as an antidote to the indigenous thanato- 
phidia, but the Surgeon-General reports that 
the saturated solution was useless as a means 
of destroying cobra venom even when em- 
ployed as a vehicle for its injection into fowls 
and monkeys. Attenuated solutions of chlo- 
ride of gold, however, on the other hand, 
when mingled with the venom previous to 
injection, render it inert; similarly, perman- 
ganate of potash destroys the virus when 
mixed with it; but such remedies have no 
efficacy when injected into the human system 
after the entrance of the venom. It will thus 
be evident that we still await the discovery 
of a specific to neutralize the poison of the 
most deadly snake of India. — British and 
Colonial Druggist.

DlARRHCEA AND EARTH-TEMPERATURES 

— The close relationship between rise of 
diarrhceal mortality and rise of earth tem- 
perature is strikingly shown by Doctor 
Priestley in his report for the past year for

the borough of Leicester, England. He 
studied very carefully the death-roll in those 
weeks wherein the temperature at four feet 
below the surface reached or exceeded 56 
F., with the view of ascertaining whether the 
height of the thermometer had any causal 
relationship with the disease. By a compari- 
son of data at one and another portion of the 
year he has found fresh prima facie evidence 
that a very close relationship of the sort in 
question does exist. Thus, allowing a period 
of fourteen days to elapse between the date 
of attack and death, seven days for average 
duration of fatal cases, and seven days for 
notification from the registrar of deaths, 
Doctor Priestley shows that, the four-foot 
thermometer having reached and passed 56 
F. on July 2d, the deaths began to rise con- 
siderably a fortnight later, and continued 
high so long as the thermometer registered 
above that temperature, but that immediately 
the thermometer dropped below the figure 
the deaths from diarrhoea fell, and continued 
to fall until the disease ceased to appear in 
the death records. The data included 153 
deaths in all, and the coincidence, if only 
such, of high temperature and high death- 
roll, and low temperature and falling death 
numbers, is of a character so striking as to 
attract attention. Doctor Priestley hopes to 
obtain, by a set of questions put in each fatal 
case, facts that will in a term of years enable 
some fresh light to be thrown on the aetiology 
of the disease. Meanwhile he has for 1894, 
as regards Leicester, obtained facts which go 
to augment the growing evidence as to in- 
crease of diarrhoea and ground temperatures 
being in the position of effect following 
cause. — British Medical Journal. 



Nuclein. — It is claimed, and we think 
with reason, that Nuclein, which is a secretion 
or a product of the white blood-corpuscles, is 
naturally a protection against disease. It is 
claimed that by the presence of this sub- 
stance in blood and in its secretions, decom- 
positions are prevented, and that in the com- 
plicated processes of digestion it plays a role 
not only important but indispensable. It is 
not confined in its action to the blood-cells, 
but exerts a powerful stimulant action upon 
the organized cells of the tissues as well. Its 
power to stimulate the brain and nerve-cen- 
tres seems to be well demonstrated, and its 
use, if such is its physiological action, is in- 
dicated in cases where, as in chronic diseases, 
the tone of the system is essentially lowered, 
and especially when persons are suffering 
from impairments incident to age. 

Professor Vaughan has been accustomed to 



prepare Nuclein from brewer's yeast. It 
may also be prepared from animal sources — 
by artificial digestion — in ways which have 
been fully described. Its use is strongly rec- 
ommended in the treatment of diphtheria, 
and better results are claimed for it than had 
been attained with the serum treatment. Of 
the preparation used in these experiments it 
is advised to inject twenty minims in the 
gluteal region of the child, and in adults 
twenty to thirty minims, according to age, 
in the back or upper portions of the chest. 
The Nuclein is absorbed in a few moments. 
Three injections are advised in ordinary 
cases. The pain is less and less severe, and 
deep injections are better borne than those 
that are subcutaneous. No ill effects have 
thus far been discovered from its use. — Omaha 
Clinic. 

Fallacy of Milk. — The popular idea that 
milk is one of the most wholesome and nutri- 
tious articles of food for use at all periods of 
life, is by many facts shown to be an error. 
Cow's milk is admirably adapted for diges- 
tion in the stomach of a calf. The bovine 
stomach is so constructed that it can deal 
with food in lumps or small masses, on ac- 
count of the ruminating habits of the animal; 
and it is doubtless for this reason that cow's 
milk is so constituted that, in the stomach, 
when brought in contact with the acids and 
curd-forming ferments of the gastric juice, it 
forms large, hard, tough curds. Woman's 
milk, on the other hand, forms small, soft 
curds. This is the chief reason why cow's 
milk disagrees with infants, as it almost uni- 
versally does, when given in an undiluted 
state. Rondot and Lepine have recently 
called attention to the fact that milk is not, 
in its constitution, well adapted to the sus- 
tenance of adults — at least, it is not a com- 
plete food; it contains too large a proportion 
of albuminoids in relation to the hydrocar- 
bons. Great numbers of persons are the vic- 
tims of migraine, bilious or sick headache, 
dullness of mind, depression of spirits, con- 
stipation, and a variety of allied and asso- 
ciated symptoms, in consequence of the free 
use of milk. The common habit of drinking 
milk is particularly injurious, as a large quan- 
tity of milk entering the stomach suddenly 
and in an undiluted state favors the forma- 
tion of very large and hard curds. — The 
Eclectic Magazine.

bined with proteid is less antiseptic than the 
.'id. The inorganic salts, especially the 

chlorides, and the total percentage ot 
in solution, fall during the pn 
Stion; albumen increases, albumoses re- 
main stationary, and peptone diminishes. 
Physiological text-books are in error 
cerning the amount of acid. The total acid- 
ity is from 0.108 to 0.36 per cent.; combined 
acidity, from 0.072 to 0.324 per cent.; free 
acidity, 0.0 1 S to 0.09 percent. The causes 
of variation are, the time after the ingestion 
of a meal, and the character of the food 
taken. The free hydrochloric acid is seldom 
over 0.09 per cent, after a proteid meal, but 
it may rise to 0.162 or 0.27 after a meal com- 
chiefly of carbohydrates. — Journal of 
the Chemical Society, Edinburgh. 



Observe 1 ions on Leprosy. — According to 
Doctor Schierbeck, of Reykjavic, in 1889 
there were only about thirty lepers in Ice- 
land. The four leper lazarettos had long 
since been discontinued, and no isolation had 
been in force, lepers only being forbidden to 
marry. That leprosy should gradually dis- 
appear where isolation was not observed but 
marriage was prohibited, seemed to favor the 
idea that the malady might be hereditary but 
not contagious; but this has proved to be 
erroneous. In 1894 Doctor Ehlers was sent 
to Iceland by the Danish Government to in- 
vestigate the condition of leprosy and found 
not less than 141 cases on the island, which 
shows there are distinct foci from which the 
disease is rapidly spreading; there are sev- 
eral cases of leprosy of undoubted contagious 
origin. In Norway leprosy is gradually di- 
minishing; there were about 3,000 lepers in 
1856, and only between 800 and 900 at the 
end of 1892. — Doctor E. Kaurin, in Norsk 
Magazin for Lagevidenskaben.

We always have supposed the germ the- 
orists believed that suppuration could only 
take place under the influence of the staphy- 
lococcus pyogenus or special pus-producing 
germ. Here we have a germ existing in a 
suppurating cyst of the liver, which has no 
relation to suppuration in the general sense, 
inasmuch as resolution may take place in 
pneumonia without suppuration. Does this 
not illustrate our position in relation to germs, 
that they exist only because favorable media 
are developed ? — Times and Register. 



Carotid Aneurysm. — Two cases of aneur-

OUTLINES OF SANITARY ORGANIZATION 

OF SOME OF THE GREAT ARMIES 

OF THE WORLD.* 

BY MAJOR JOHN VAN RENSSELAER HOFF, SUR- 
GEON U. S. ARMY. 

(Continued from page JJ4.) 

IV. THE FRENCH ARMY. 

A study of the military history of the 
French— a people who loved war, and who, 
in the words of the great Sully, " had pursued 
no other trade than that of arms" — affords 
the most satisfactory results in determining 
the evolution of Military Sanitation. 

Since the days of Par6, "The Father of 
Modern Surgery," whose services were so 
universally recognized, and whose opinion 
was so highly valued by the Army that it was 
sought even upon purely military questions, 
military sanitation has advanced, by halting 
steps indeed, until to-day it has become the 
most specialized of the many specialties in 
our profession. 

In 1591, at the siege of Rouen, field hos- 
pitals to follow the movements of armies first 
J appeared in France. The Hotel des In- 
avalides, for worn-out and disabled soldiers, 
[was founded in 1659. In 1630 medical of- 
ficers were first given a distinctive military 
title. In 1708 a royal edict created a per- 
Imanent service of medical and surgical in- 
spectors-general and majors to accompany 
I the Army — this corps numbered two hundred 
officers, and its organization has continued 
from that day. In 17 18 schools for army and 
navy medical officers were founded. In 1747 
Fontanieux promulgated a code of regula- 
tions for the government of military hospitals 
— the foundation of sanitary regulations ob-

geons. 



taining to-day; he reorganized hospitals for 
the training of medical officers, and instituted 
sanitary councils. In 1761 De Chamousset 
inaugurated competitive examinations for 
appointment as medical officer, and estab- 
lished a central pharmacy. In 1780 The 
Journal of Military Medicine and Surgery was 
founded. 

With continued peace the French military 
sanitary service retrograded, and in 1788 the 
medical corps numbered scarcely 170 officers; 
this is the common history of every military 
organization. No truer words were ever 
written than those of the rhyming soldier of 
Delhi: 

"When war is rife and danger nigh, 
'God and the Soldier!' is the People's cry; 
When peace is made and all things righted, 
God's forgot, and the Soldier slighted." 

And particularly are they true of the Medical 
Service: In all grades of society we find a 
disposition to ignore the value of medical 
men, until sickness or accident compels an 
appreciation of their value. If this be true 
in civil life, how much more so is it in the 
army, in times of peace, when no heed is 
ever given to the warning from military san- 
itarians to "prepare for war." 

But to return to France. The Revolution 
broke out and was followed by the Consulate 
and the Empire, a period of unceasing de- 
mands upon the sanitary service — the period 
of Percy, Larrey, and Desgenettes. Thanks 
to the activity, knowledge and genius of 
these men, the work was crowned with a suc- 
cess previously unknown. Percy and Larrey 
disputed the honor of having perfected the 
field hospital and ambulance wagon. Larrey, 
pressed by the necessities of the situation, 
devised the "Cacolet," by means of which 
the sick were carried on the backs of mules 
and camels. At Jaffa, pestilence decimated 
the army; Desgenettes conquered it. In the 
marvellous campaigns of Napoleon, in which

he moved huge m :nen from one end 

thcr, his efforts

! at that time in creating 
and training a sanitary corps from disunited 
and heter IS elements — a corps the 

:' which had never existed in any army 
before, and of which, indeed, Napoleon him- 
self had never thought — seems to-day to be 
the crowning glory of that heroic age. But 
the full fruition was not yet — indeed, is not 
yet. The strange notion that the brain capa- 
ble of originating such an organization could 
not command it, obtained then, and obtains 
to-day; it is the irrepressible conflict in every 
service. The Medical Officer recommends, the 
General commands % and an officer of direction, 
in ten dance, or what not, executes. 

October 19th, 1S41, an ordinance was en- 
acted giving medical officers rank in the 
Army, but without authority; even in their 
own corps they remained under the control 
of the Bureau of Direction, through which 
alone they could communicate with the mili- 
tary authorities. By a decree of May 3d, 
the Medical Corps obtained autonomy, 
and assimilation in organization to other staff 
corps of the French Army; but in 1852 this 
decree was declared revolutionary. Vainly 
had the medical officer demanded reform; 
and then came the sad lesson of the Crimea. 
Always the same story— it is written in the 
history of every nation, in ours in deeper red 
perhaps than in others'; and the pity is, this 
same lesson requires to be learned over and 
over again. The decree of June 18th, i860, 
gave the medical officer rank, assimilating to 
that of other officers. The lessons of the 
Crimea, of the Italian War, of the over- 
whelming disaster of 1870; the devotion of 
medical officers in Africa and in Mexico — all 
were necessary to destroy prejudice against 
and prove the value of autonomy for the 
Medical Department. To-day, in spite of all 
opposition, the cause, in France at least, has 
been gained. 

Let us still further consider the lesson 
taught by this nation, by a glance at its per- 
fected sanitary organization, the merest out- 
line of which, it is believed, will convince the 
most incredulous that military sanitation is, 
as has been heretofore stated, the most spe- 
cialized of all the specialties of our profession.

first and second class; S :or of the 

first and second class; Assistant 
Principal Apothecaries, firsi ond class; 

Apothecaries-Major of the first and second 
Assistant Apothecaries-Major, first and 
second class. These grades, among both medi- 
cal and apothecary officers, correspond to the 
grades of the military hierarchy, and the 
persons holding them have the standing of 
officers. The correspondence of the grades of 
the military and medico-military hierarchies 
runs from Medical Director-General, who 
ranks with a General of Division, down to 
the Assistant Surgeon-Major or Assistant 
Apothecary-Major with the rank of Second 
Lieutenant. 

The total strength of the corps, according 
to the budget of 1892, is 1400, distributed as 
follows: One medical director-general, nine 
medical inspectors, forty principal medical 
officers (first class), forty-five principal medi- 
cal officers (second class), 296 surgeons-major 
(first class), 456 surgeons- major (second 
class), 393 assistant surgeons- major (first 
class), seventeen assistant surgeons- major 
(second class), — total, 1257; one inspecting 
apothecary, four principal apothecaries (first 
class), five principal apothecaries (second 
class), forty-three apothecaries-major (first 
class), fifty-eight apothecaries-major (second 
class), thirty- eight assistant apothecaries - 
major (first class), four assistant apothecaries- 
major (second class),— total, 143. 

The personnel of the Corps &lt;/e Sante is 
distributed as follows : 454 medical and 
apothecary officers in the "Directions" and 
Hospitals,! sixty medical and apothecary offi- 
cers detached on various services, 876 medi- 
cal officers of all grades assigned to regi-

iThe Military Government of Paris and the 
Army Corps have each a medical inspector or prin- 
cipal medical officer (first class) as director of the 
sanitary service. The three divisions of the Nine- 
teenth Corps in Algiers have each a medical direc- 
tor; also the Brigade of Occupation in Tunis.

ments, battalions, etc., six medical and 
apothecary officers in the Gendarmerie and 
the Garde Republicaine, four medical officers 
with Fire Brigade, — total, 1400. 

A regiment of infantry, three battalions of 
four companies each, has generally one sur- 
geon-major (first class), one surgeon-major 
(second class), and one assistant surgeon- 
major (first class). The eighteen regional 
regiments of infantry have, however, no 
surgeon-major of the first class. Each sep- 
arate battalion of infantry has one surgeon- 
major (second class) and one assistant sur- 
geon-major (first class). Cavalry regiments 
have no surgeon-major of the first class. 
Regiments of artillery, and pontonniers, have 
the same number of medical officers as in- 
fantry regiments, but separate battalions of 
artillery have no surgeon-major of the first 
class. Engineer regiments have each one 
surgeon-major and one assistant surgeon- 
major, both of the first class. Each squadron 
of the train has one assistant surgeon-major 
of the first class. 

The Annuaire of the French Army for 1893 
shows some changes in the totals and figures 
just given, as follows: One medical director- 
general, nine medical inspectors, forty prin- 
cipal medical officers (first class), forty-five 
principal medical officers (second class), 313 
surgeons-major (first class), 479 surgeons- 
major (second class), 296 assistant surgeons- 
major (first class), 118 assistant surgeons- 
major (second class), — total, 1301. Total 
number of apothecary officers of all grades, 
11 5- Aggregate for 1893 of the Corps de 
Sante, 141 6.* 

The sick of the different regiments and 
separate battalions are cared for in regimental 
infirmaries, or in quarters, according to cir- 
cumstances, and by the regimental medical 
officers, who attend not only the officers and 
soldiers of the regiment, but also their fami- 
lies. Cases requiring hospital treatment are 
sent to the hospitals. 

There are thirty-five military hospitals in 
France, and a large number in Algeria and 
Tunis. Hospitals are divided into five classes: 
First class, 600 or more beds: second, 400 to 



* Apparently they are increasing the number of 
medical and diminishing the number of apothecary 
officers. 



599 beds; third, 300 to 399 beds; fourth, 200 
to 299 beds; fifth, less than 200 beds. There 
are also among the military four "thermal" 
hospitals, where men can be treated with 
mineral waters. 

In localities where military hospitals do 
not exist, or where they are insufficient, civil 
hospitals are required to receive and treat 
soldiers when sent by military authorities; to 
this end civil hospitals are divided into two 
categories: Mixed or militarized hospitals 
{hospices mixtes ou militarists') , and civil hos- 
pitals properly so called (hospices civils pro- 
prement dits). In the first category are classed 
civil hospitals having wards specially told off 
to military patients, and whenever a garrison 
numbers 300 men the military patients are to 
be treated in such special wards and to be 
under military hospital regulations. In the 
second category are classed town hospitals, 
where the garrison is below 300 men, in 
which military patients will ordinarily be 
placed in the regular wards if special wards 
are not obtainable. In a garrison of 1000 
men the treatment of the sick will be at- 
tended to by military medicai officers; with 
a garrison of less number, duty in the mili- 
tary wards is performed by civil surgeons 
where the military personnel is insufficient. 
In civil hospitals properly so called, military 
patients are treated by civilian surgeons, and 
the State pays all expenditures incurred in its 
behalf; there is also a regular appropriation 
made each year for the remuneration of the 
attending civilian surgeons. 

The personnel of the military establish- 
ments comprises, in numbers fixed by the 
regulations: Medical officers; officers of the 
hospital administration; hospital orderlies 
(injirmiers); chaplains; Sisters of Charity 
(Soeurs Hospotalieres). There is a chief 
medical officer to each military hospital, and 
such number of other medical officers as may 
be required as assistants. 

The officers of the Hospital Administration 
are a branch of the Intendance, and, under 
the chief medical officers, administer the 
military hospital service, have command of 
the sections of injirmiers, and of the detach- 
ments of injirmiers in the different hospitals. 
In 1892 they numbered: fourteen principal 
officers of administration; fifty-six officers of 
administration, first class; fifty-six officers

Hospital Of Tnfirmiers). — The Sec- 

tions of Infirmiers are for employment in 
hospitals, with ambulances, and at medical 
depots. These are twenty-five in number, 
distributed as follows: The first nineteen are 
attached to the army corps of the same 
numbers; the twentieth and twenty-first sec- 
tions are attached to the Nineteenth Corps 
Igeria), making three sections to that corps; 
the twenty-second, twenty-third and twenty- 
fourth are attached to the military govern- 
ment of Paris; the twenty-fifth to the military 
government of Lyons. — A detachment, taken 
from one of the home sections, is on duty in 
'funis. The total number of men in these 
Sections, in 1892, was 1439 non-commissioned 
officers, corporals and trumpeters, and 3960 
soldiers, — aggregate, 5399. Each Section 
comprises: Hospital orderlies for duty in the 
wards; orderlies employed as clerks; order- 
lies for general duties, such as cooking, clean- 
ing the wards, etc. 

The budget for 1892 also provided for 
seventy-seven hospital chaplains and for ra- 
tions and clothing for 292 hospital Sisters. 

Regimental Hospital Orderlies. — There is 
one infirmier per battalion in time of peace, 
and in addition there is a corporal detailed 
to take charge of the infirmary. One of the 
regimental tnfirmiers is detailed each week 
for duty in the infirmary. 

The patients in the infirmaries, and the 
convalescents, are rationed by the general 
mess. Such men as are on special diet live 
in the infirmary, and the cooking for them is 
done by one of the cantiniercs designated by 
the commanding officer; if there is no can- 
tiniere, all get their meals from the regula-r 

War Sanitary Organization. — The duties 
pertaining to the sanitary service in the field 
are: To anticipate, prepare, and execute san- 
itary measures which will insure the health of 
the command; in action, to render first aid to 
the injuried; to transport the injured to a 
place of succor; to organize ambulance, field 
and general hospitals. This service is divided 
into Service of the Front and Service of the 
Rear. The former comprises all sanitary for- 



mations which accompany the troops on the 

march, while the latter embodies all those for- 
mations which form a part of the armies in the 
field, but which do not march with the troops. 
Distributed in rear of the armies of opera- 
tion, these formations are not subject to the 
army corps commanders, but to the Director 
of Lines of Communication, himself subordi- 
nate to the Director-General of Railways and 
Lines of Communication, and to the Chief of 
the Genera] Staff. 

The Service of the front is divided into 
three echelons: (1) The regimt ntal service, 
intended to give first aid to the troops when 
stationary, on the march, and during engage- 
ments: (2) The ambulance (field) hospitals, 
intended to supplement the regimental service 
during marches and halts, to receive the 
wounded on the battle-field, and to give them 
such care that they can be sent to the rear 
(evacues) promptly. — Each army corps pos- 
sesses one ambulance hospital or dressing- 
station for each division of infantry, one for 
the cavalry corps, and one for headquarters, 
and each independent cavalry division has 
one ambulance hospital. — The ambulance 
hospitals are classed with the fighting train: 
(3) The field hospitals, intended to relieve 
the ambulance hospitals in the evening or 
the next morning; to continue the "evacua- 
tions" (despatch of the wounded to the rear); 
to treat the sick and wounded on the spot; 
and eventually to reinforce the ambulance 
hospitals on the battle field. The number of 
field hospitals assigned to each army corps 
is fixed by the Minister of War. 

The Sanitary Formations of the Rear con- 
stitute two groups intended for the formation 
of hospitals on the spot, and for "evacua- 
tion" and re-supply and refitting. The first 
group comprises: The field hospitals tempo- 
rarily fixed from time to time in rear zone, to 
treat on the spot sick and wounded unable to 
be moved; and such of the permanent mili- 
tary and civil hospitals as are found near the 
lines of concentration, as well as the auxiliary 
hospitals created by the aid societies. The 
second group comprises: The evacuation hos- 
pitals placed at the heads of the different 
lines of communication — the patients are 
treated here until they can be sent to the inte- 
rior; the station infirmaries and the infirmaries 
of the stopping-places on the lines of evacua-

tion, which furnish food, care and medicines 
to the sick and wounded en route, etc.; hospi- 
tal transports, comprising railway evacuation 
trains, wagon evacuation trains, and hospital 
transport ships; station magazines established 

[ on the lines of communication; depots for 
convalescents and broken-down men, estab- 
lished along the lines of march and evacua- 
tion in the vicinity of field or evacuation 
hospitals, to receive such convalescents as do 
not have to be sent home. — These conva- 
lescent camps are established by the Chief 
of the Medical Service of the Line of Com- 
munication, to receive such men as are sent 
by the superior commanders. 

The Infantry Division Ambulance Hospi- 
tals are divided into as many sections as there 
are brigades in the division. A headquarters 
ambulance hospital consists of two sections. 
Hospitals of Evacuation (field) may be 
divided into several sections, etc., viz.: First, 
| Directions," consisting of medical officers 
of the active list, of the reserve, and of the 
territorial army; auxiliary medical officers; 
physicians and apothecaries impressed into 

I service; the officers and cadet-adjutants of 
the hospital administration in the active, re- 
serve and territorial armies; the inftrmiers of 
the active and territorial sections, eventually 

I auxiliary infirmiers detached from other 
troops; detachments of the military train; 
ministers of different creeds; eventually hos- 
pital Sisters: Second, Establishments created 
by the various aid societies, Red Cross, etc. 

— delegates, physicians, agents, infirmiers, 
litter-bearers, according to the decree relat- 
ing to these societies. 

For each battalion of infantry, each brigade 

(of cavalry or group of mounted batteries, one 

J medical wagon is allowed for the transporta- 
tion of medical supplies. To cavalry regi- 
ments and horse battery groups are attached 
small carts for the transportation of the 

; wounded, each to carry a medical pannier. 
Ambulance hospitals have various kinds of 
wagons for different purposes, but field hos- 
pitals are permitted no ambulance wagons, 
only vans for the transportation of their sup- 
plies. 

The Medical Director-General is chief of 
the entire sanitary services. Each army 
has also a medical inspector, director of the 
sanitary service; each Corps d'Armee a prin- 



cipal medical officer, corps director; each 
division a principal medical officer, or sur- 
geon-major, chief of the medical service. 
The lines of communication of an army have 
a principal medical officer, chief of the medi- 
cal service. Finally, a fortified place or 
group has a principal medical officer or sur- 
geon-major, chief of the medical service. 

Each Director or Chief of Service controls 
his department — has authority over all the 
personnel on duty in the ambulance or other 
hospitals under his command, and with re- 
gard to these officers and men has the same 
disciplinary powers as other officers of his 
rank. The Officer of Administration controls, 
under the authority of the Chief Medical Of- 
ficer, the administrative service, as well as the 
order and discipline of the sick and the in- 
firmiers; under the same authority he com- 
mands and administers the detachment of 
infirmiers, having the disciplinary powers of a 
company commander. 

The Regimental Sanitary Service is in- 
tended to give first aid at stopping-places, 
on the march, and during engagements; the 
personnel is as follows: One surgeon-major 
and assistant surgeon-major of the active ser- 
vice, and two reserve or territorial officers 
(assistant surgeon-major and auxiliary sur- 
geon) to each regiment of infantry, Zouaves, 
or Tirailleurs; to each battalion of Chasseurs- 
a-Pied one active surgeon-major and one 
assistant surgeon-major (reserve or territor- 
ial); regiment of cavalry -or Chasseurs de 
Afrique, only one active surgeon - major; 
each divisional group of six batteries of artil- 
lery has one assistant surgeon-major (active) 
and one auxiliary surgeon (reserve); the 
first group of corps batteries has one active 
surgeon-major and one reserve auxiliary sur- 
geon, and the second group one active assist- 
ant surgeon-major and one auxiliary surgeon 
(reserve); a group of three batteries, cavalry 
division, has the same medical officers as the 
second group of corps batteries; first echelon 
of the park has one assistant surgeon-major 
(active), only, as likewise has the second 
echelon of the main artillery and bridge train 
park. 

On a war footing, the regiments of infan- 
try, of cavalry, and the regiments and bat- 
talions of artillery, have one infirmier per 
company, squadron, or battery; and in each

infantry company ami artillery battery :. 
in the field four bearers; each battalion 

and 'iip Of batteries has, I ne 

bearer- corporal; for a regiment of infantry 

the: additional bearer, with the rank 

int. The additional infirmicrs re- 
quired on mobilization are furnished by the 
rve — those for the infantry by the musi- 
cians and workmen, and those for the artil- 
lery by the musicians of the artillery schools. 
The complement is made up by the artillery 
musicians of the reserve. 

The non-commissioned officers of the bear- 
ers of infantry, and the corporals from the 
musicians or workmen, are of the reserve. 

The Chief Medical Officer directs the sani- 
tary service under the authority of the com- 
mander of the regiment or battalion, and is 
aided by other medical officers in the order 
of their rank; the auxiliary surgeons (who 
rank as adjutant, non-commissioned officers) 
aid the medical officers of the active army, 
the reserve, and the territorial army, and can 
in no case become chiefs of the medical ser- 
vice. 

The regimental infirmiers are exclusively 
employed in caring for the sick when the 
troops are stationary or on the march, under 
the immediate direction of the auxiliary sur- 
geons; in battle they assist the medical offi- 
cers in organizing and working the dressing- 
stations. They can be temporarily called, 
in case of urgent necessity only, to assist 
in the service of the ambulance and field 
hospitals. Regimental infirmicrs and bear- 
ers, to the exclusion of all other combat- 
ants, are entrusted with the duty of picking 
up the wounded on the battle-field and car- 
rying them to the dressing-stations; in the 
discharge of this duty they are directed by 
the non-commissioned officers and corporals 
of the bearers. When a battle is impending, 
the bearers report to the senior medical offi- 
cer; after the action is over they return to 
the ranks. 

When the troops are stationary, the regi- 
mental infirmicrs are organized as in time of 
peace. During actions, the dressing-station 
is established by the medical officers and 
infirmicrs of the battalion or group, and is 
connected with the firing line by the regi- 



mental 1" the only pel 

entrusted with the duty of moving the 
wounded back from this line. The musicians 
of the battalion form a relay between the 
sing-Stations and the ambulance r&lt; 

Division Ambulance Hospitals are sub- 
divided into two sections. The personnel of 
the first is, one surgeon-major (active), one 
' ant surgeon- major (active), two assistant 
surgeon-majors (reserve or territorial), one 
officer of the Administration (supply of: 
one chaplain, one student of the I 
school, fifteen infirmicrs (two non-commis- 
sioned officers, three corporals, ten privates), 
forty-nine bearers (one non-commissioned 
officer, two corporals, forty-six privates); of 
the second, one surgeon-major (active), two 
assistant surgeon-majors (reserve or terri- 
torial), one officer of Administration, fifteen 
infirmicrs (two non-commissioned offi 
three corporals, ten privates), forty- nine 
bearers (one non-commissioned officer, two j 
corporals, forty-six privates). 

The personnel of the Train, first section, is 
made up of one lieutenant of the train, one non- 
commissioned officer, one veterinarian, one 
corporal-quartermaster, two corporals, one 
blacksmith, one workman, one trumpeter, three 
mounted teamsters, thirty-four unmounted 
teamsters, four orderlies of the train for the 
mounted officers; second section, one lieu-J 
tenant of the train, one non-commissioned 
officer, two corporals, one saddler, one work- 
man, one trumpeter, two mounted teamsters, 
thirty unmounted teamsters, one orderly of 
the train for the surgeon-major. 

Such is the personnel in each part of the 
sanitary service of this Army. The organ- 
ization is simple, but, simple as it is, it de- 
mands of each of its members, outside of a 
knowledge of scientific questions of treat- 
ment, a very exact military execution. 

In the recent issue of The Broad An

Not the least remarkable evidence of the great 
progress made by the French in the organization of 
their army is to be found in the official treatise, 
" Reglement sur 1c Service dc Same de 1'Armee en 
Campagne." Tlusc regulations are marked by a 
thoroughness and attention to detail which, if 
carried into effect in war time, will result in the 
complete efficiency of their hospital service, and a 
corresponding diminution of suffering to the sick 
and wounded. The tactical employment of the

Ambulance Service is most carefully treated, and 
what is remarkable is the provision made for its 
presence with the most advanced troops. 

V. THE GERMAN ARMY. 

In accordance with the principle that the 
maintenance of the efficiency of an army is 
the essential element of success, and that 
therefore the care of the troops is one of the 
most important duties of the commanders 
and the administration, the greatest attention 
is paid to sanitary matters by the German 
military authorities. In this army — as in all 
others — the sanitary organization naturally 
divides itself into personnel and material. 
The former includes the medical officers, who 
have the rank of combatant officers and oc- 
cupy positions of absolute equality with them; 
apothecaries who rank with administrative 
officials; non-commissioned surgeons and 
apothecaries; hospital stewards, nurses, etc.; 
and in active service the litter-bearers. The 
sanitary material and institutions are the 
garrison hospitals and regimental dispen- 
saries, and in war the field hospitals, com- 
municating and reserve-of-base hospitals, 
etc., etc. 

Peace Sanitary Organization of the German 
Army.* — The Medical Division of the Ger- 
man War Ministry is headed by the General- 
stabsarzt — equivalent to Surgeon- General or 
Medical Director-General of the United 
States Army. In addition he is charged with 
duties similar to those of an inspector-general 
of a special army of the service. He has the 
rank, pay and emoluments of a major-general. 

Each of the army corps — twenty in num- 
ber, counting the two Bavarian corps — has a 
Surgeon-General (Generaldrzi) as Medical 
Director. f These officers are divided into 
first and second class, and rank respectively 
with colonels and lieutenant-colonels. 

The Surgeon-General of an Army Corps is 
the head of the Medical Department in his 
district, and distributes the medical officers 
as he sees fit. The senior surgeon-major 
(Oberstabdrzt) of each division is appointed 
Divisional Surgeon. General (garrison) hos- 
pitals are under surgeons-major, who are 



* Data furnished by the Division of Military In- 
formation, Adjutant-General's Office, U. S. Army. 

\ There is also one Surgeon-General, Chief of 
the Frederick William Institute. 



appointed Hospital Directors, and are the 
commanding officers of the hospital personnel, 
with the powers of punishment of a company 
commander. The sick from all organizations 
serving in the same garrison enter the same 
hospital. Berlin and several of the large 
garrison towns are divided into two hospital 
districts, with a hospital in each. 

The grades below Surgeon-General are: 
Surgeons-major (Oberstabdrzle) , surgeons 
(Stabdrzte), and assistant-surgeons (Assistenz- 
arzte). Surgeons-major and assistant-sur- 
geons are divided into two grades, first and 
second class; there are also sub-surgeons and 
one-year volunteer surgeons, who rank as 
non-commissioned officers (with officer's 
sword-knot). 

As a rule, a surgeon-major is the senior 
medical officer of a regiment, and surgeons 
or assistant-surgeons of battalions and smaller 
detached units, etc. The total number of 
medical officers proper in the whole Army, 
counting Bavaria, is, according to the last 
budget, 2068. 

To the headquarters of each army corps is 
attached a Corps Staff Apothecary, who 
superintends, under the direction of the 
Surgeon-General of the Army, the procure- 
ment of medicines, etc., for the dispensaries 
of the several hospitals in the corps district. 
Apothecaries (who, as before stated, belong 
to the higher officials of the military adminis- 
tration) are appointed by the War Ministry 
on the recommendation of the Surgeon- 
General of the Corps; they have the stand- 
ing of officers, but are without relative rank. 

Hospital dispensaries are usually placed 
under the immediate charge of a medical 
officer, by the chief medical officer. Assist- 
ance is given in the dispensaries by one or 
more one-year volunteer apothecaries, i. e. 
pharmacists who wish to discharge their 
liability to military service in this way. 

There is a Hospital Administrative Per- 
sonnel which is recruited from non-commis- 
sioned officers with at least eight years' ser- 
vice, and who are divided into chief hospital 
inspectors, inspectors of hospital administra- 
tions, and hospital inspectors.* They need 
not be, and indeed rarely are, medical men; 



*The total number in 1888 was 191 — forty-seven 
of the first, thirty-two of the second, and 112 of 
the third grade.

Division) of the War Ministry. 

The Hearer Companies of the war forma- 
tions are mobilized from the train battalions, 
and have no existence or merely a "cadre" 
in time of peace; there is. however, a large 
force of "LazaretA gehulfen" or hospital as- 
sistants, maintained in time of peace, one to 
each company, battery, etc., and made up of 
men who have been trained in minor surgery 
and in "first aid," and have the rank and 
pay of non-commissioned officers. The total 
number on the last budget was 3848. 

Suitable men, who have been fairly in- 
structed as soldiers for six months, are de- 
tailed, under the direction of the Surgeon- 
General of the Corps, as sick-attendants or 
nurses {Kranken icarter) at garrison hospi- 
tals, where they are trained for service with 
field hospitals in time of war; their number 
is of course not fixed, but they may be said 
to vary from 400 to 600. There are a few 
civilians also hired for this purpose, from 400 
to 500 in all. 

War Organization. — The War Sanitary Or- 
der of January 10th, 1878, fixes the organ- 
ization of the Medical Department of the 
German Army in the Field as follows: One 
Surgeon-General in Chief in Berlin, one 
Surgeon General attached to Imperial head- 
quarters, one to each independent army, one 
to each army corps, one Division Surgeon to 
each division. 

Two medical officers are attached to each 
battalion of infantry (of four companies, 
about one thousand total strength), and one 
hospital assistant to each company. Two 
men per company are trained as litter-bearers. 
A medical stores w r agon is attached to each 
regiment (three battalions). A regiment of 
cavalry has three medical officers and four 
hospital assistants — one per squadron ; a med- 
ical stores wagon is also attached. The light 
artillery has two medical officers for each 
battalion (of three or four batteries), and a 



hospital assistant for each battery. The 
heavy artillery also has t\\ 
for each battalion (four batt . and hos- 

pital assistants as in the light artillery. The 
a medical officer and hos- 
pital assistant with each unit 

It will be observed from the foregoing that 
the regimental sanitary organization [fl 
clearly defined. It forms the first line of 
medical assistance in active service, and its 
field of work in battle lies between the skir- 
mish line and the collecting-station^. 

The medical units comprise the regimental 
aid already described, bearer companies, field 
hospitals, lines-of-communication hospitals, 
and base hospitals. 

The Bearer Companies are integral parts 
of the train battalions of the army corps to 
which they belong, and are numbered u First 

Bearer Company of the Army Corps," 

etc., etc. One of them is attached permanently 
to each division, and one is kept at the dis- 
posal of the Corps Commander and is at- 
tached to the Corps Artillery. Each is divided 
into two divisions, each complete in itself. 
The establishment of a bearer company is: 
Seven medical officers, one paymaster, one 
apothecary; officers of the train, one captain, 
two lieutenants, three under-officers of the 
train, three lance-corporals of the train, four- 
teen privates of the train, twelve soldier 
servants of the train, seven tradesmen, one 
sergeant-major of the bearer company, fit- 
teen under-officers of the bearer company, 
two buglers of the bearer company, 176 lance- 
corporals and stretcher-bearers, eight hospital 
assistants, eight sick-attendants, — total, 261. 
Also thirteen saddle horses for officers, six 
troop ditto, twenty-six draught, and two 
spare draught,— total, forty-seven; also thir- 
teen two-horse carriages. 

The carriages of a bearer company are 
eight ambulances, two medical stores wagons, 
two baggage wagons, and one provision 
wagon— all two-horse. The ambulances are 
of the 1872, 1874, or 1877 patterns, and carry 
two severely and three slightly wounded men. 
Wagons of the former patterns are equipped 
with seven, those of the 1887 pattern with 
nine, stretchers, so that a bearer company 
with old equipment has fifty-six, that with 
new seventy-two; with each stretcher a 
knapsack containing dressings is supplied. 



THE MEDICAL AGE.

On each of the wagons of a bearer company 
are carried two shovels, one pickax, one 
ax, and one hatchet. In action the bearer 
companies form the second line of assistance; 
they work between the collecting-stations es- 
tablished by the regimental medical service, 
and the dressing-stations formed by them- 
selves. 

The Field Hospital constitutes the third 
line of medical assistance. For each army 
corps of two divisions are mobilized twelve, 
and for each corps of three divisions eighteen, 
field hospitals, each of which can receive 200 
wounded or sick and can be divided into two 
sections. The establishment of a field hos- 
pital is as follows: Two surgeons-major, three 
assistant surgeons, one apothecary, one hos- 
pital inspector, one accountant, one assistant 
apothecary, one sergeant ward- master, one 
under-officer clerk, one under-officer stores- 
keeper, nine hospital assistants, twelve sick- 
attendants, one cook, two transport under- 
officers, two transport lance-corporals, one 
transport trumpeter, nine transport drivers, 
eight officers' servants, — total, fifty-six, offi- 
cers and men;* five officers' riding-horses, five 
troop ditto, twenty draught, — total, thirty 
horses; one two-horse baggage wagon, two 
two-horse medical stores wagons, three four- 
horse material and stores wagons, one two- 
horse carriage for officials, — a total of seven 
carriages. The medical stores and baggage 
wagons are the same as those of bearer com- 
panies, and in the former are carried the hos- 
pital stores required, a coverlet and a pair of 
sheets for each patient, — but no other bed- 
ding, which is obtained locally by requisition, 
and no tents; all stores have been reduced to 
the lowest possible number, so as to diminish 
1 the transport and increase the mobility of 
these hospitals. 

The Lines of Communication and War 
Hospitals are, as a general rule, taken charge 
of by the auxiliary societies for aid to the 
wounded. For the war hospitals which are 
formed to take over the wounded who can- 
not be moved when the field hospitals start 
to follow their corps, each army corps mobil- 



*Field hospitals may also be equipped with four 
two-horse material wagons, and one two-horse am- 
bulance wagon, in place of the four-horse material 
and stores wagons; in which case they have twenty- 
eight horses and nine carriages. 



izes nineteen medical officers, three apothe- 
caries (six other officials), twenty-seven hos- 
pital assistants, three under-officers, thirty-six 
sick- attendants, twenty- four train soldiers, 
and three cooks. All persons in medical units 
wear the Geneva Cross above the left elbow. 
The War Sanitary Personnel and Trans- 
port embodies sixty-three bearer companies, 
258 field hospitals and twenty war hospitals, 
with a total of 21 11 medical officers, 189 
train officers, 1338 officials, 29,673 non-com- 
missioned officers, 10,701 horses, and 2625 

carriages.

FATTY DEGENERATION AND ITS MAS- 
QUERADES.* 

BY EPHRAIM CUTTER, M.U., LL.D. 

When muscular, nervous, glandular and 
fibrous tissues are replaced by fat, — i.e. oil, 
amyloid, lard, wax, stearic acid, etc.,— the 
condition is denominated fatty degeneration, 
or a fatty ill. This is a normal process in 
the corpora lutea and the sub-involuting or 
pregnant uterus; but the fatty epithelia of 
the mammae, liver, sebaceous and ceruminous 
glands are not ills, neither is obesity a fatty 
degeneration, because there is no substitu- 
tion of tissue but merely excess of normal 
development. Nevertheless obesity tends to, 
and may be found in connection with, fatty 
degeneration. Organs invaded by fatty de- 
generation soften, necrose, and break down 
as in destructive inflammations, hence this 
condition is often confounded with inflam- 
mations; and as a matter of fact the two 
sometimes occur together, though the nomen- 
clature which terms fatty degeneration of the 
kidneys a " nephritis," and that of the spinal 
column a "myelitis," is unwarranted and a 
masquerading of real things. 

Regarding causes: The English idea is 
that the point of departure is a chronic re- 
tardation or impediment of function, spe- 
cially of a mechanical kind from want of 
proper exercise, from ligatures, from ab- 
normal pressure, etc. — in other words, where 
there is retardation or impeded circulation of 
capillaries, of glandular osmosis, of secretion 
or excretion, of nerve force, of chyle, of

Association.

lymphatic fluid, etc., there will be found fat 

forms replacing other normal 

structure. It must not be n that fat 

.n situ naturaU and not in 

The Micrographic Dictionary justly 
is this doctrine as one of the most im- 
portant contributions to the knowledge of 
the nineteenth century acquired by the use 
of that beautiful and useful instrument, the 
compound microscope, which is moreover in- 
'.e to the diagnosis and treatment 
of fatty ills and their masquerades. This 
doctrine is also a foundation for calisthenics 
properly used, and for the dignity and use- 
fulness of daily labor. 

The conventional idea is that fatty ills 
arise from the excessive and exclusive use of 
fats and carbo-hydrates as food; the gour- 
mand's delight, the Strasbourg pie ox pate de 
&gt;as. made from the livers of geese that 
have been constantly stuffed and crammed 
with food beyond repletion, meantime being 
kept in close and heated confinement, is usu- 
ally considered sufficient cause for this state- 
ment. Yet every one knows that an exclu- 
sive fat diet tends to confer fatty ills. 

The American idea, which so far as the 
writer knows originated with Doctor James 
H. Salisbury, is that carbo-hydrates, or food 
from the vegetable kingdom, fed in excess, 
particularly to those of sedentary- habits, by 
fermentation incline to form carbonic, sul- 
phydric, phosphydric and other acid gases 
which, developed persistently and in excess, 
tend to paralyze certain parts of the body, 
and that such paralysis retards and impedes 
function. Thus is produced the same stasis 
referred to by our English brethren, with the 
same results; and the evidence goes to show 
that this fact more than any other explains 
fatty degeneration. The connection between 
the consumption of alcohol and fatty degen- 
eration is well understood. Drunkenness is 
partial paralysis. The long and steady use 
of beer, though it may never induce intoxica- 
tion, unquestionably has a tendency to shorten 
life by some form of fatty degeneration, which 
may assert itself in many parts of the body.* 



*The substitution of beer for whiskey is claimed 
to be a move for temperance; but this I very much 
doubt, since it ultimately leads to the acceptance 
of malt beverages by many who would never other- 
wise use spirits. 



\ "e that the action of certain poison* | . 
form of fatty degeneration; phosphorus 
produce death in twenty minutes, when the 
mien —as in a recent case 

rved by Doctor H. P. Bo wd itch and my- 
self — the heart muscles undergoing 

fat necrosis. Retardation of function is ! 
another means of inducing fatty ills 
may be seen in the parenchyma of the leaves 
of the New England maple, resplendent in 
glorious death, during the fall of the year; 
also in the parenchyma of Baldwin apples 
where the barrel-head has impressed a smooth 
facet. 

Fatty ills occur often in organs of compli- 
cated knotty structure, such as the kidneys; 
in tough fibrous structure, as in the liver; in 
organs where the blood goes backward on it- 
self, as the heart, because the circulation is » 
more readily obstructed or impeded. On the $ 
contrary, when the capillary circulation is ' 
free and normal, other things being equal, 3 
fatty substitution in normal tissues cannot ' 
occur. A too quick circulation characterizes J 
inflammations. 

When seeking to diagnose by the clinical 
microscope a suspected case of fatty ill, the 
evidences available, in priority of sequence, | 
are as follows: 

Amyloid bodies. — These are almost exactly i 
like starch grains, and are found in the blood. -i 
urine, tissues, and on the skin — I think these 
are amongst the first to appear in fatty de- 
generation, and sometimes the last to go; 
some regard them as normal in the brain tis- | 
sues, but inasmuch as brain tumors have been 1 
found post-mortem in persons who had never 
given evidence of brain trouble, this so-called I 
"normal amyloid" may be abnormal and be 
latent. 

Free oil in blood, in large and small globules, 
or in various amoeboid shapes. — Normal sub- 
cutaneous fat is not an oil, but a solid or semi- 
solid; and subcutaneous oil, though of itself 
not an important sign of fatty ills, when com- 
bined with other signs is very important— ■ 
evidences a lowered vitality and diminished 
power of resistance of the body; it is not 
virile. 

Free oil in the white blood-corpuscles. — I en- 
dorse this as most valuable diagnostic evi- 
dence of fatty ill — a fact first pointed out by 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 



587 



Doctor James H. Salisbury. Normally the 
leucocytes do not contain oil globules, and 
no patient is really cured unless these oil 
globules disappear from the white blood- 
corpuscles. 

Muscular fibre in fatty degeneration. — 
Make a section over the deltoid through the 
skin, thrust a barbed spear into the muscle, 
and withdraw, bringing with it some of the 
muscular tissue, which under the microscope 
shows globules of fat surrounding the fibrillae. 

The physics of the urine voided before rising 
in the morning. — Albumen, fatty epithelia, 
casts of kidney tubes, amyloid, free oil. — 
Should the first three be absent in the first 
specimen, separately or collectively, I am 
accustomed to take seven successive speci- 
mens in a suspected case: I have yet to find 
a case where amyloid and free oil appeared 
in blood specimens and in white corpuscles, 
in which also albumen or fatty epithelia or 
casts were not found during a week's search. 
It does not answer to have urine examined 
morphologically or chemically once in a year 
or two, for it may be normal one day and ab- 
normal the next. Amyloid and free oil are 
rare; regarding the latter, one must be cer- 
tain the oil is not the result of employing an 
I old castor-oil bottle as a container. 

Oil in fojces.^This is an additional sign 
when oil is not present as a medicine or food; 
here the pancreas is often at fault.* 

Microscopical signs not well known. — Pain 
is often mistaken for rheumatism, though the 
latter may be a complication; the morphology 
of rheumatic blo®d being absent we must 
look elsewhere for a cause. I think there are 
cases of neuralgia and hyperesthesia caused 
by fatty degeneration, for angina pectoris 
arises from cholesteric deposits in the coro- 
nary arteries; tic douloureux has been caused 
by fatty infra-orbital nerves; and I have seen, 
in a male adult, intense general hyperes- 
thesia attending a fattily degenerated sub- 



* These clinical morphologies are more charac- 
teristic close to the patient. A clinical microscope 
used with a common candle is able to do most of 
the work at the bedside, hence the name. The 
Cutter clinical microscope has been used with all 
objectives, even including the high power of ^ of 
R. B. Tolles, and is thus able to cope with the 
present problem. The one-inch objectives are the 
best to detect the kidney tubule casts. 



maxillary lymphatic — learned laymen and 
physicians called it cancer, and though aspi- 
ration showed the gland to be undergoing 
fatty degeneration, as determined by mor- 
phological examination, I could not convince 
the patient that his throat was not "full of 
cancer," and he starved to death, claiming 
that the hyperesthesia and the activity of 
the salivary glands would not permit him to 
eat. The autopsy in this latter case proved 
my diagnosis to have been correct — there 
was no cancer in throat, pharynx, tongue, or 
larynx — only the maxillary lymphatic was 
fattily degenerating. The man had for sev- 
eral years been under treatment for impend- 
ing Bright's disease. While it is possible to 
have fatty degeneration without pain, it is 
well to remember that pain is in some in- 
stances caused by this morbid process. 

The detection of fatty degeneration of 
muscles by inspection with a barbed spear, 
the presence of oil globules in the leucocytes 
and blood, and the presence of amyloid in 
the circulation, are facts worked out by Doctor 
James H. Salisbury, but the knowledge of 
the presence of free oil in the feces is the 
result of my own researches. I believe, 
moreover, no one besides myself has empha- 
sized the importance of these diagnostic ap- 
pearances, in connection with those afforded 
by the urine, as embodying a new physical sign 
of the pre- apoplectic state, of which I shall have 
something to say in a forthcoming paper with 
illustrative cases. 

First among the masquerades of fatty ills 
is amyloid. This I think should be regarded 
as one of the early stages of fatty degenera- 
tion, from a clinical point of view, because of 
its close affiliation with fatty ills. — I have 
found this practical estimate safe and useful. 
Treated as a fatty ill the amyloid often dis- 
appears permanently — indeed, it yields very 
readily to treatment. 

The idea popularly entertained, that Apo- 
plexy comes from an increased force of cir- 
culation, has some foundation, but not the 
special significance that attaches to the 
weakening of the cerebral arteries by the 
partial change of their substance into the soft 
weak bodies of oil, lard, tallow, or grease; 
often the artery gives way under normal 
heart-pressure during sleep. — The essence of 






THE MEDICAL AGE. 



apoplexy is fatty degeneration of the arterial 
- 

The causal lesions of AV vvVji-y are 

the same -is t: OOplexy; the muscular 

ftened by some form of 
fatty degeneration, yield to normal heart- 
ire; the ophthalmoscope reveals the 
extravasation of blood and the clots in the 
.'. substance; the mechanical arrange- 
ment of ocular tissues facilitates the retarda- 
tion and impeding of circulation. — A healthy 
ocular artery should not rupture from any 
intra-vascular pressure during life. 

Some may not agree that Amaurosis is a 
fatty masquerade, but I do not feel at liberty 
to ignore it, since oculists assert this affection 
is chiefly due to a diet of carbo-hydrates in 
excess, and that retinal paralysis is part and 
parcel of fatty degeneration. 

Glaucoma, also, should be considered as 
fatty degeneration, and it has been most in- 
teresting to witness the manner in which 
oculists struggle with the surgical side of this 
serious condition; the primary treatment 
should be systemic, the surgical secondary. 

The consensus of medical opinion is that 
Angina Pectoris is due to calcareous deposits 
in, or atheromatous degeneration of, the coro- 
nary arteries; but cholesterin is often the basis 
of the deposit, though lime deposits also occur 
along with the fatty. It is easy to see how 
fatty degeneration of the heart muscles may 
follow partial obliteration of the coronary 
arteries — if the English idea is entertained; 
and the neuralgic element of angina pectoris 
may be explained by nerve force being par- 
tially cut off owing to diminished flow of 
blood, and by the partial heart paralysis de- 
veloped through overworked but otherwise 
sound muscular tissue. Overworked muscles 
cause cramp; pain is due to a partial paralysis. 

The peculiar ring about the periphery of 
the cornea known of Arcus Senilis is due to 
deposit of fat. — The transparent glassy 
cornea is nourished mostly by imbibition; 
the circulation is not free, and hence is easy 
to retard or impede; and the fatty deposit 
comes as the powers of life fail in the aged. 

Atheroma "consists of globules of oil of 
the most varied sizes, frequently exceedingly 
minute, mixed with albuminous matter in the 
form of amorphous masses of flakes and 
molecules, plates of cholesterin, and gran- 



ules of carbonate of lime." (Micrographic 
onary.) 

kmtia is literally "dumbness," neverthe- 
n the medical nosology it is made to 
cover the terms and conditions known as 
ataxic and amnesic (inability to employ 
language fluently); it is, I opine, merely the 
sequel to fatty degeneration of the speech 
ganglionic nerve centres. 

Brigkfs Disease of Kidneys is diagnosed by 
the presence at one time, or in succv 
examinations during seven days, (first) of 
albumen, (second) of casts, and (third) of 
fatty epithelia. — How easy it is to impede 
function in the kidneys because of the re- 
versed currents of blood in the papillae, Mai- 
pighian tufts, and urinary tubules! Bat this 
masquerade is in no way revealed by such 
titles as "interstitial" or "parenchymatous" 
nephritis, etc. 

Bright 's Disease of the Lungs is a compara- 
tively rare malady, known in Germany, that 
simulates consumption; yet it is only a pul- 
monary fatty degeneration, as evidenced by 
the clinical morphologies; histologically and 
anatomically there is no reason why the lungs 
should not exhibit fatty degeneration as well 
as the kidneys. 

Broken Heart may be literal as well as figu- 
rative. When the muscles of the heart are 
largely replaced by fatty degeneration they 
are liable to rupture under normal exertions; 
indeed, when the vast unceasing work of this 
organ is considered, it is a daily miracle that 
this accident does not more often occur.* 

Some nineteen years ago I learned for my- 
self that all Cataracts were forms of fatty 
degeneration of the crystalline lens, and I 
possess a number of photographs taken by 
myself at that time which corroborate the 
correctness of this position. Sir Benjamin 



*Many creatures — those that depend for exis- j 
tence exclusively upon vegetable diet, such as the 
Leporida — are especially susceptible to rupture of 
heart as the sequel of shock or fright. The great 
bulk of hares — miscalled rabbits — found in market 
exhibit this condition. We have repeatedh 
"cotton-tails" killed by a single pellet that just 
entered the skin: twice saw a varying hare {Lcput 
Virgimund) die from being seized by a dog, though 
there was neither wound or compression; and even 
the shock induced by the snare is often sufficient. — 
In each instance the right ventricle was the seat of 
the lesion. — Ed. 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 






Ward Richardson personally told me he had 
produced cataracts in both eyes of guinea- 
pigs and frogs in less than ten minutes' time 
by hypodermatic injections of a saturated 
watery solution of common sugar; and sugar 
in excess is a great cause of fatty ills. 

Intestinal Concretions, in most instances, 
are made up of accumulations of fatty acids, 
though some are calcareous. 

Gall-sto?ies. — A woman once came to me for 
examination who insisted she passed gall- 
stones after using olive oil; the morphology 
of these concretions proved them to be made 
up from fatty acids derived from the oil. 
Genuine gall-stones are concretions of fatty 
acids from the liver. 

"Heart Failure" is a double masquerade 
in that it is applied to both a cause and a dis- 
ease. — In the eighteenth century they did 
better, as a treatise was written (1700) on 
" Causes of Heart Failure." This term means 
simply a fatty heart; but besides, the diag- 
nosis includes the gouty diathesis of elderly 
people, rigid arteries, and flabby tissues. — 
The physician who gives in " heart failure " 
as a cause of death, should produce the evi- 
dence of cause, and thus honor his profession: 
when a bullet or knife penetrates the heart, 
the organ necessarily "fails!" 

Other maladies that masquerade as fatty 
degeneration are: Melancholia; dementia; 
neurasthenia, or nervous prostration; para- 
plegia; paresis; hemiplegia — see remarks on 
apoplexy already made; softening of the 
brain; tic douloureux; rupture of muscle; 
impeded circulation from embolism; senile 
gangrene; hebetude, or listlessness; perni- 
cious anaemia — it is an American idea that 
the terminal arterial vessels in the spleen be- 
come fattily degenerated, hence a loss of 
blood-discs so pernicious and severe as to be 
fatal (Salisbury); shaking palsy; shock devel- 
oping paralysis and Bright's disease; puer 
peral convulsions — a masquerading that is in 
reality an acute fatty degeneration; retinitis 
albuminuria; rupture of uterus; general hy- 
peresthesia; haemophilia — a case of fifteen 
years' standing lately came under the care of 
my son, Doctor John A. Cutter, in which 
there has been decided improvement. 

More instances might be cited, but the 
foregoing are sufficient to establish the fact 
that it would be better if medical nomencla- 



ture presented fewer masquerades; better to 
call things by right names, whereby the way 
would be made clear for proper treatment, and 
better results accrue to the practice of medicine. 

Regarding the management of fatty ills, 
and the principles involved, it may be said 
Nature usually cures if allowed — that is, her 
actual and potential forces operate to restore 
normal in place of abnormal tissues. The 
cause or causes, whatever it or they may be, 
must be removed; in particular, such foods 
as fats, carbo-hydrates, or animal or vege- 
table products that tend to fermentation and 
formation of gases within the alimentary 
canal, must be stopped, including also alco- 
hol, whether formed outside or inside the 
system; malted liquors are specially ob- 
jectionable. All physical obstructions also, 
such as corsets and tight environments of 
the body, require to be removed, since the 
circulation must be free and clear. In order 
to quicken the circulation and stimulate the 
functions that are impeded or retarded, free 
use should be made of such quickening foods 
as hot water and beef. Give the former at 
the temperature of tea or coffee, one pint one 
hour before each meal and on going to bed; 
distilled water is best, spring water next, 
hydrant and well waters poorest of all. — Note 
that hot water starts gases quicker than any- 
thing else, by promoting peristalsis down- 
wards, and sometimes upwards by belching; 
it relaxes nerve spasms; dilutes normally the 
blood so that it will flow through the capil- 
laries, whose length has been estimated at 
over 100,000 miles; washes out the stomach, 
bowels, liver, kidneys, skin; dissolves gravels, 
which are great causes of retardation and 
impeding of functions; carries the blood to 
the surface of the body; and is not a dan- 
gerous remedy, as some aver. — To sum up, 
if you wish to quicken the circulation, chyme, 
glands, alimentary canal, osmosis, nerves, 
lymphatics, so as to keep the body systemic 
in "good running order" literally, use hot 
water as indicated; indeed, if cut down to 
only one resource in these diseases, retain 
hot water, which alone has cured cases irre- 
ducible by other means. 

The heart quickly responds to. and is 
strengthened by, beef. It is not necessary 
to stimulate the frequency of the pulse, but 
rather to increase its dynamos without quick-

ening the beat, — even our vernacular ex- 
presses this idea h I "hearty" 
tad of being afraid of 
"heart I, would use more of it to 
gthea the heart, they would thus ob- 
viate the existing prevalence of fatty ills! 
Mutton and lamb arc next t«&gt; beef for this 
purpose; then follow eggs (specially the 
whites), game, cod-fish, fresh lobster, 
lops, clams. If possible have the patient live 
on hot water and the foregoing foods alone, 
with pepper, salt, and butter for relishes: - 
sparingly, also, Worcestershire and Halford 
sauces — not all these together, however, but 
one or two at a time. To those who cannot 
do this, the two-thirds by bulk of animal food 
to one-third from the vegetable kingdom — 
not counting liquids — would be much better 
than the ordinary conventional proportions. 
Despite the assertions of vegetarians, the 
condition of the urine shows that this propor- 
tion is normal. — No one ever knew a case of 
fatty degeneration to recover on a vegetable 
diet, but I have seen numerous cures by fol- 
lowing the diet just outlined. 

Management is an important element in 
the treatment of fatty ills; a French investi- 
gator states that physicians treat but twenty 
per cent, of the sick. I had a multimillionaire 
sick with Bright's disease who was too poor 
to be under observation; he undertook his 
case literally. Cases of fatty ill must be 
under treatment for months; charges should 
be made according to means of patient. The 
servant girl cannot pay as much as her rich 
master; it is better to have something for 
services from her than to treat her in a hos- 
pital or a dispensary for nothing. 

It is also necessary to treat fatty ills by 
conservation of vital forces, thereby securing 
more to the needs of the economy; these in- 
clude: Rest— all schools of medicine adopt 
this principle of rest in illness; proper exer- 
cise; a light and dry atmosphere; stimulus 
of ideas, will, etc.; stopping the "useless 
expenditure of nerve force in ineffectual 
mental operations;" trust in Cod — Oliver 
Wendell Holmes counseled young physicians 
to avail themselves of the good effects of 
spiritual advice to the sick, and " faith curists" 
secure happy results in some instances by stop- 
ping all worry and fret over the cares of life; 
stop the leaks in the nervous system, thus sav- 



ing tb( &gt;ower to do body systemic work 

with; do not forget also that life is a ques- 
tion of the making and using of vital forces, 
that careful husbanding saves and prodigal 
expenditure lavishly wastes and leaves not 
gh to properly perform functions — hence 
fatty ills arise; the presence of g and 

healthy personality confers power, as when 
"the woman with an issue" touched our 
Saviour's garment and was healed, he 
"Who touched me? For I perceive that vir- 
tue has gone out from me." — It is als&lt; 
of the elder Pitt that none could be with him 
in his cabinet without feeling stronger for it; 
and my father, Doctor Benjamin Cutter, had 
the power to soothe teething babies to sleep 
that had worn out their parents in nightly 
vigils; indeed, the best and most popular 
practitioners have this dynamic power, which 
forms no inconsiderable item in the measure 
of their success, regardless of medical knowl- 
edge; but some, on the contrary, present the 
opposite, and, like vampires, sap the vitality 
of their patients. 

Massage is another valuable therapeutic 
measure, the secret of which lies more in the 
conferring of force than in the manual move- 
ments; I have known some masseurs to de- 
plete patients of strength instead of bestow- 
ing it upon them. — This is an important 
subject worthy of a special paper. Hygiene 
also must not be forgotten; neither fresh air, 
exercise or baths can be had without some 
exertion. 

Strengthening the heart is always an essen- 
tial measure, which can be done with the aid 
of food, as already mentioned; by diminish- 
ing its work, as by posture, the feet being 
higher than the head, as in my invalid chair; 
by removing the gases which paralyze this 
organ more or less; by the laying-on of 
hands over heart and stomach; by dry 
heat, with Indian meal as a vehicle, for ex- 
ample; by drinking hot water, combined or 
not with aromatics; by absorbing the athero- 
matous and calcareous deposits of the coro- 
nary arteries by treatment; by going up stairs 
or heights slowly; and by appropriate drugs. 

Salicin, strychnine, digitalis, combinations 
of the fluid extracts of cinchona, coca, pyrus 
malus rad., lettuce, yerba santa, grindelia 
robusta, and others of the mild vegetable 
tonics, should be employed as indicated;

some patients need a great deal of medicine, 
others little; the function of the physician is 
to employ what is needed. Pain is also a bad 
element in some cases; morphine is inter- 
dicted, yet a case of locomotor ataxia under 
my son's care would have died if not for the 
use of Brown-Sequard anti-neuralgic pills; 
cannabis indica is a good sedative; valerian, 
sumbul and asafcetida may also be employed; 
Messrs. Parke, Davis &amp; Co. at my son's re- 
quest made up their Liquor Sedans with 
glycerin and no sugar, and have listed it as 
" Liquor Sedans ^ 2 &gt; without Sugar;" this is 
a valuable sedative and tonic and should be 
widely used. 

Music and vocal culture are forms of aerial 
motion, which penetrate the body, and, as 
demonstrated by Professor Dogiel, of Kazan, 
Russia, increase the force of the blood circu- 
lation if not of the spirits; again, Professor 
Tarschanoff of St. Petersburg has shown that 
music rests fatigued muscles and helps to 
drive out carbonic acid while increasing the 
consumption of oxygen. Music then is a 
pleasant medicine for fatty ills caused by re- 
tarded or impeded circulation. This subject 
is attracting attention, and ere long I expect 
to see music ordered from the druggists 
(music boxes, etc.) as we now order drugs; 
at all events I have adopted it as a medicine 
in my public lectures; and it is an old idea 
worthy of revival. 

Heat, which is a form of motion, imponder- 
able, colorless, invisible, yet measurable, per- 
vades the body during life, and its absence is 
a good sign of death; it is a royal means to 
restore retarded or impeded function. 

Light is an exquisite and almost incompre- 
hensibly rapid form of motion; without it, 
man would die; he was made to live in the 
life of light; therefore it is indicated in the 
treatment of fatty ills. 

Another remedy is galvanism, which has a 
double current of motions to quicken function. 

I might cite the many and important cases 
upon which this paper is founded, and in 
which the evidences of fatty degeneration 
were found and removed by modes of treat- 
ment herein outlined, but time and space will 
not permit; I therefore reserve these for 
some future occasion.

THE EVOLUTION OF RELIC WORSHIP— A 

PAGE FROM THE HISTORY 

OF MEDICINE. 

BY P. C. REMONDINO, M.D. 

Belief in a supernatural or a theocratic 
medicine has always existed — it was the first 
form of medical theory that suggested itself 
to primitive man, as, in accordance with the 
processes of evolution that mark his mental 
development, he emerged from animal into 
intellectual life. Fear and terror were the 
sentiments that first inspired ideas either of 
medicine or of religion, and these sentiments 
were more or less modified by the topography 
and meteorology of the country. A moun- 
tainous, echoful, wooded region, subject to 
great and sudden storms, acted more on the 
imagination than a flat and level waste. It 
required a towering Olympus, a cloud-crested 
Sinai, or the solitude and awe-inspiring sub- 
limity of the vale of Crissa shadowed by the 
peaks of Mount Parnassus, to evoke from the 
imagination mythological ideas. In his be- 
nighted state, man first materialized his 
nebulous ideas of a deity by setting up a 
stick or the mummified remains of some 
animal as a fetich; later on, and with an 
upward evolution of the intelligence, he 
carved out of wood or stone a reflection of 
his image of deity. Mounting upward in the 
intellectual scale, his religious ideas under- 
going a corresponding refinement, objects of 
imposing proportions gradually replaced the 
inanimate objects of fetichism. A lake or 
river, a mountain or a vale, a spring, brook 
or tree, then became the abode of deity. 
Even here, the combined elements of religion 
and of medicine comprised in the disappear- 
ing fetichism had no connection with philo- 
sophic ideas of morality or hygiene. Religion 
was as yet all for national, family or self pro- 
tection, whether in war, the chase, in sickness, 
or in connection with the more material pro- 
ductions of the earth upon which men fed. 
Later on came the combination of astrology 
and mythology and the worship of the 
planets; medicine was made to enter into the 
new scheme, and we find that as late as the 
eighteenth century planetary influences in 
conjunction with physical ills and medica- 
tions were occupying the minds of the other- 
wise intelligent. 

Medicine was for centuries a priestly pre-

mer afforded by PlatOJ our know

yards from Greece to Egypt and India. 

The well pronounced theocratic medicine and 

DC Of the Hebrews, founded on the 

most solid basis of philosophy, emanated, 
without doubt, from the Egyptian temples. 
However reverent or orthodox we may be, 
we cannot escape the conviction that the the- 
ocratic authority was here simply used to 
compel the observance of regulations which 
the Hebrews could not otherwise have been 
made to observe or to understand. In this 
respect the Mosaic medicine resembled that 
of the Greek temples, shrines, and asclepions, 
or the still earlier medicine of the Egyptian 
priesthood. The Philistines and other disrep- 
utable and ungodly conglomerations living in 
the vicinity of the Chosen People, ignorant of 
the fact that Mosaic laws were founded on a 
knowledge of physiology, pathology, and other 
branches of vulgar medicine, attributed all 
the physical benefits enjoyed by the Jews to 
the watchfulness of Deity; which only con- 
firmed them more and more in their own 
errors and in the more assiduous worship of 
their gods, from whom they expected to ob- 
tain like immunities. 

The Greek Hippocrates was the first to 
deliver medicine from its theological entan- 
glements, and to show the earthly origin of 
diseases, as well as that their cures depended 
upon a philosophical understanding of them. 
With the elaboration of philosophical studies, 
Greek medicine became a science, and, grad- 
ually invading the West, uprooted the medi- 
cal superstitions of paganism and of the 
savage tribes brought under the influence of 
the new civilization. Meanwhile came the 
Roman conquest of Judea and the destruc- 
tion of Jerusalem by Titus, w r ith the dis- 
membering of the Jewish nation and the 
disappearance of their theocratic medicine. 
Christianity was then slowly struggling into 
existence, accompanied by an evangelical 
medicine somewhat similar to that of the 
Christian Scientists of the present day; and 
Roman medicine presented as many conflict- 



.a\&lt;\ creed to be 

found in the United Stat' a There were the 
. superstitionists, the Galenists, and the 
Meth ind the profession was being 

torn over the disputes that were carried on 
OUS therapeutists and 1 a- 
bian temporizers — between too much med- 
ication on the one hand, and too much 
expectancy on the other. Doctors traversed 
the streets of Rome, with a miscellaneous 
rabble of admiring disciples at their heels. 
Medicine and demagoguery went hand in 
hand, and it was a continued medical Donny- 
brook Fair. Schools of Galenic medicine, 
nevertheless, flourished, and the asclepions, 
or hospitals of the Galenics, were of great 
benefit to the people; but the masses were 
still superstitious, and along with the medi- 
cine of Galen and that of Erasistratus flour- 
ished Asiatic magic and Egyptian paganism 
stripped of its ancient philosophy. 

In the fourth century, as a result of the 
sudden conversion to Christianity of Con- 
stantine, the state of medicine in the West 
underwent a great revolution, which must be 
partly attributed to the influence of the em- 
press mother Helena, who, with more fervor, 
zeal and Christian piety than either philoso- 
phy or science, completely suppressed rational 
medicine, and along with it all the warring 
medical sects; and on the ruins of these she 
planted an altogether new form of theocratic 
medicine under the guise of relic worship 
and relic influence. All practices of medicine 
not in accord with the strictest dogmas of the 
new theocracy were promptly outlawed; the 
asclepions were closed; and the N'estorian 
Christians (who refused to subscribe to the 
wholesale destruction of all rationalism), as 
well as the Jews (who through their religious 
teachings believed in a rational medicine), 
were driven to the Arabians, with whom they 
could meet on a level in their ideas of the 
unity of God, as opposed to the Trinitarian 
doctrine decreed by the Council of Nicaea. 
In Arabia, exiled rational medicine found a 
temporary resting-place, whence it was to 
reenter Europe in the keeping of its pro- 
tectors with the ending of the Crusades some 
seven centuries later. In Constantinople — 
the Byzantium of the Romans — the hospitals 
taken from the Nestorians were given into 
the care of the new Christian clergy. The

civilized world then saw an accentuated 
revival of the old Hebrew theocratic claims. 
Religion was paramount to all else, and the 
pretended representatives of God took pre- 
cedence in all things. Saint Ambrose then 
set the pace through which the papacy was to 
rule the rulers and their nations for many 
centuries to come. 

Saint Ambrose was to the Western church 
of the fourth century what Becket undertook 
to be to the English church in the twelfth. 
Ambrose was a much greater man, however, 
than Becket, and when he defied the emperor 
of the world by his memorable sentence, 
" The emperor is of the church, and in the 
church, but not above the church," he fully 
adjusted the position that the church was .to 
hold in the future, and which it so signally 
exemplified in its treatment of Henry IV. in 
the eleventh century. The claim was very 
simple, depending wholly on the admission 
that kingly rule was subordinate to theocratic, 
of which emperors and kings were mere sub- 
jects. A consummate diplomat, a born ruler 
and leader as well as a great executive, an 
artistic and exceedingly refined and esthetic 
ceremonialist, a cultivated logician, and a 
Scripture scholar who could well combine 
the lessons of the Old and those of the New 
Testament, — fired by a zeal, a piety, and a 
philanthropy second only to that of Saint 
Paul, — Ambrose was well calculated to lay 
the foundation of the power of the church, as 
he charmed the people and was fully able to 
overawe the various emperors and empresses 
that reigned over Rome during his tri- 
umphant prelateship in Lombardy. Carried 
away by his religious enthusiasm, and un- 
doubtedly influenced by his surroundings, he 
took an entirely opposite stand from those 
assumed by Saint Chrysostom in Byzantium 
and Saint Martin in Gaul in reviving the age 
of miracles, the veneration of relics and the 
belief in their miraculous power. The rest- 
ing-place of the two martyrs Gervaise and 
Prodatius having been revealed to him in a 
dream, their remains were exhumed and en- 
shrined in the cathedral church, and from 
this source was fanned into a bright flame 
the idea of remedial intervention on the part 
of relics; and here on a firm and lasting basis 
was established the power of a new theocratic 
medicine. 



During the same century the empress- 
mother Helena had discovered the True 
Cross whilst excavating for the foundation 
of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on 
Mount Calvary; and from various quarters 
were gathered the Holy Coat, which the 
cathedral of Treves now claims to possess, 
and all the various accessories that served at 
the Passion. We may well form an idea of 
the number of relics that flooded the West, 
from the inventory of those brought back 
from the Holy Land by one single returning 
pilgrim. This was Saint Anstremoine, of 
Clermont in Gaul, whose stock of relics com- 
prised some of the hair and beard of our 
Lord, all the nails of his left hand and 
two from his right, together with a number 
of parings from the others; a piece of the 
sponge that had been soaked with gall and 
vinegar at the crucifixion; a portion of the 
crown of thorns; a piece of rock from the 
holy sepulchre, with a part of the shroud or 
winding-sheet in which the Saviour had been 
wrapped at his burial; and a piece of bread 
from the Last Supper. When this is well 
considered, and also that every returning 
pilgrim was as well laden as his means of 
purchase and transportation would permit, 
and every catacomb and cemetery teemed 
with the ready remains of thousands of 
martyrs, we can well understand how all the 
churches were supplied. The field of Water- 
loo has furnished enough buttons, breast- 
plates, shako ornaments and military accou- 
trements to fit out twice the number of men 
engaged in that battle; and I well remember 
that during my stationment at Williamsburg, 
Virginia, an enterprising firm of Northern 
undertakers patriotically advertised that they 
were able, for a consideration, to furnish the 
body of any Union soldier that had fallen in 
that battle. It is needless to say that the 
recipients of the little cases containing the 
remains did not enter into a too close identi- 
fying analysis, just as it is needless to say 
that undoubtedly many of the bodies so 
shipped were the ones asked for, as many 
graves had been marked. In the fourth cen- 
tury it was considered very impious to doubt 
or question the authenticity of any saintly 
relic, and, we might even add, rather danger- 
ous in a psychological sense, as suggestive 
punishment prompted by remorse and re-

Si likely to follow. So by 
the work □ motion by the Kir. 

Helena, confirmed by Saint Ambrose, and 
stimulated four centuries later by the Em- 
Irene — who wtLS a worth)- successor of 
a — the worship and the int 
influence oi relics became accepted dogmas 
in the church. 

There is no material difference, in the the- 
ocratic bearing of the subject, whether one 
if believers undertakes to allay an epi- 
demic of cholera, plague, smallpox, or any 
pandemic disease, through the exhibition of 
relics and processions, or through humble 
and silent prayer in the solitude and dreari- 
ness of an American clapboarded house. The 
irrationalism is all the same, and, although 
the superstitious details may differ, the piety 
and zeal originate in the same sources and 
tend to the same ends. It is a straying away 
from the path of reason and an utter neglect 
of all the teachings of philosophy and of tried 
science. Whilst in the hands of so-called 
purely divine medicine — whether through 
relics, exorcism, processionings, fasts, vigils, 
or only through faithful prayer — Europe was 
ravaged again and again by devastating epi- 
demics: the Jews, who in their continued 
observance of the philosophical hygiene en- 
grafted in their creed, escaped the virulence 
of these outbreaks, were more than once mas- 
sacred as being in league with the devil. And 
this is the tendency and end of all irrational- 
ism. It was so when pagan Greece wor- 
shipped the spear of Achilles and the Pal- 
ladium, along with the tools that had built 
the Trojan horse; the Olympic traditions 
and irrational mythology of that period could 
ill brook the rationalism of a Socrates, who 
was therefore disposed of by a judicial potion 
of hemlock; it was only an episode of the 
struggle between science and philosophy on 
the one hand, and blind and ignorant super- 
stition on the other such as slew Hypatia in 
the streets of Alexandria, through the fanati- 
cal adherents of Cyril, in the fifth century. 
And we are slowly drifting in a direction that 
tells us that, whilst some men are advancing, 
the great mass cannot emancipate themselves 
from the inherent love of the marvellous and 
of the mystic that we see in primitive man.

THE -NEW" MEDICINE. 

Report has it — and there is apparently no 
room for doubt — that at the last session of 
the Mississippi Valley Medical Association 
one of our Missouri brethren expressed his 
belief that the medical man "is in danger of 
becoming too professional;" for his own part, 
he was "in favor of proprietary remedies 
which have come to the profession through 
pharmaceutic channels." 

If this "prophet" is to be accredited, it is 
high time medical schools were closed, medi- 
cal and pharmaceutical societies disbanded, 
and pharmacopoeias, dispensatories, and 
works on pathology, anatomy, physiology, 
therapeutics, etc., relegated to the junk shop 
— in fact, let the present practice of medicine 
go where the Bard of Avon long ago wished 
to relegate it — in other words, to the "dem- 
nition bow-wows." This is an era of new- 
ness; everything is "new," even the doctor. 
Philanthropy is the only true science, and 
if the physician desires a share therein he 
must, perforce, at once start a factory for the 
manufacture of pharmaceutical nostrums, or 
manage a medical periodical in the interest 
of the same. Half a century ago the Ayers, 
Holloways, Schencks, Radways, Jaynes, et al. 
were anxious to furnish proprietaries to the 
profession "through pharmaceutic channels," 
but were deterred therefrom owing to the re- 
spect and dignity that hedged about the too 
professional character of the medical prac- 
titioner of those days: thus was missed the 
golden opportunity that came almost un- 
sought to their successors. Now medical

text books are effete; the Hippocratic oath 
obsolete; physiology a "back number;" 
therapeutics unmitigated rubbish; pathology 
valueless without a French or German hall- 
mark — but all these can be readily replaced 
by the literature furnished gratuitously by 
the proprietary-medicine interest, or by the 
chipper elucidations of the gentry who suavely 
drop samples and do not hesitate to solve off- 
hand the most abstruse of medical problems. 

The old "physic" was a relic of barbarism. 
The " new " medicine is philanthropic and gra- 
tuitous. Then why not permit the proprietary 
gentlemen to issue diplomas and licenses to 
practice, since it is to be only through their 
sufferance medicine is to exist? The "new" 
practitioner must enter hand-in-glove with 
these empirics and quietly and thankfully 
accept such crumbs as fall from the tables 
of the pharmaceutical Diveses, or else seek 
new modes of subsistence. The only other 
alternative is to seek salvation at the hands 
of village "grannies," blackamoor "mam- 
mies," and fire -water -absorbing red men, 
all of whom, as is well known, are super- 
humanly and inherently endowed with the 
keeping of the most abstruse of Nature's 
secrets! The proprietary interest is given 
to purloining prescriptions from the med- 
ical profession; but the Indian and Negro 
are at least original if not palatable — they 
may not disguise acetanilid and nitro-glycerin 
compounds under catchy titles; they may 
prefer whiskey to cheap alcohol; but their 
remedies do possess the exclusive merit (to 
the average citizen) of being "direct and 
fresh from Nature's laboratory." 

And, come to think of it, why should we 
abandon savage Nature for proprietary "Art," 
when the latter demands tolls that tunefully 
represent profits of from 500 to 50,000 per 
cent.? The gentlemen who purloin formulas 
are, to be sure, actuated only by the very best 
and aesthetic of motives. But then the major- 
ity (like ourselves) have not reached the high 
pinnacle of proprietary aesthetics, and their 
pockets are but modestly lined, hence it would 
appear more practicable to stick to poor Lo 
or the voodoo nigger. While we all know 
the broad humanity of the proprietary-medi- 
cine interest, and its desire to aid the "suf- 
fering public" — all of which leads to the 
expenditure of large sums for literature, 



fancy advertisements, and the hiring of oily- 
tongued agents, — would not the profession 
be able to retain to itself some reputation for 
philanthropy by sticking closer to the village 
granny and tag-alder bitters ? — It's not fair 
the proprietary element should have it all. 

We only wonder that the profession has 
not recognized these facts before, particu- 
larly as we have all absolutely suffered as 
the result of the philanthropy of the proprie- 
tary ilk, who flood our desks and tables with 
all sorts of nostrums bearing fancy, catchy, 
freaky, and un-philologic preparations — re- 
cently we were obliged to hire an individual 
to remove these accumulated evidences of 
liberality, and that, too, greatly to the detri- 
ment of the navigation of a neighboring 
water-way. 

To be sure, there is always guarantee that 
the proprietary nostrum is combined in a most 
ethical manner; that it exactly contains what 
each agent says it does; and that its physio- 
logical and therapeutic effects— even though 
the remedy was discovered but yesterday — 
have been carefully worked out during a 
quarter of a century of experience at the 
hands of the most expert scientists, though 
the process of " proving " was necessarily held 
a profound secret. Nothing more should be 
required, if we are not content with the eru- 
dition of fetichism and superstition, pure and 
unadulterated — free from sordid aims and 
reasoning. 

When we realize what an immense amount 
of capital has been tied up in educational 
institutions to a useless end, and how easy 
it is for philanthropy to rule the world and 
to cure all diseases, it seems passing strange 
that our boasted civilization has been taking 
us further and further away from the light; 
and we cannot be too grateful to our Mis- 
souri brother that he has led us from that 
"broad way which leadeth to destruction" 
into the narrow path which assures ever- 
lasting proprietary virtue. The only way 
that medicine can now become an exact 
science is through the ipse dixit of those 
philanthropic enough to start factories for 
the preparation of pharmaceutical nostrums 
— to add to the everlasting list of " ines" 
"ides" "as" and "o's." Knowledge of 
chemical combination or therapeutic rele- 
fancy is superfluous. All the world can be-

CODEINE. 

This alkaloid of opium has been well known 
to physicians and druggists for many years, 
and yet its therapeutic relations and value 
seem to be little understood. There appears 
to be a general feeling that it is a substitute 
for morphine— which is very far from being 
the truth; and as a sequence, complaints of 
inert or inactive character of the drug are 
quite the reverse of uncommon. 

The fact is that pure Codeine is never in 
any degree a succedaneum for the narcotic 
alkaloids of opium, and in no sense does it 
represent the constituents of the drug from 
which it is derived. It is not even a certain 
hypnotic; and so far as any analgesic effect 
is concerned, it is utterly useless. There are 
a large number of remedies in the materia 
medica which are much more desirable than 
Codeine, and the attempted substitutions — 
for they are no less— that attach to it thera- 
peutically have no more practical basis than 
that it is an opium derivative. This alka- 
loid, moreover, is usually exhibited in minute 
doses, under the supposition it is as potent as 
morphine, whereas as a matter of fact it has 
frequently been exhibited in doses of several 
grains — eight, ten, and twelve — without un- 
toward effect. 

It is possible also that the knowledge re- 
garding the alkaloid is so far defective that 
no two preparations represent the same 
strength — this is a point upon which we have 
never been able to secure, even from those 
who are deemed experts, satisfactory infor- 
mation; and the United States Dispensatory 
for 1894 seems to hold the same idea, since 
it says: 

It is probable that pure Codeine is a very feeble 
alkaloid tolerated by the human system in very 
large doses. On the other hand, cases of severe 



rimentors

evident that commercial Codeine has !&gt;&lt;-en. and 

probably still is, of varying composition, and the 

results frequently obtained have been produced by 

coherent alkaloid. 

Finally, the Dispensatory adds that, on ac- 
count of frequent contamination, care should 
be exercised as to the initial dose; but no 
effect can be expected from less than one 
grain of any kind of Codeine. 

It is evident this drug needs more study 
and experimentation at the hands of both 
chemists and therapeutists. 



SHOULD INSANE CRIMINALS BE EXE- 
CUTED? 

Doctor Daremberg, the well known French 
practitioner and philanthropist, insists that it is 
folly to preserve the lives of insane criminals: 
such philanthropy, he holds, is at best but a 
mistaken one, and the moment an individual 
becomes a menace to society, the quicker he 
is placed beyond all power to do harm the 
better — a sentiment we heartily echo. He 
cites the case of a copying clerk whom he 
knew in his youth: 

The man had been in an insane asylum because 
he had, without the slightest reason or provocation, 
killed a neighbor in cold blood. His subsequent 
behavior in the asylum caused the guardians to 
think that he had recovered from his dangerous 
madness, and he was liberated. One day my 
father entrusted this man with a valuable medical 
manuscript, which had been lent by the Munich 
library. The clerk was to copy it. and we accom- 
panied him to his own door in the Rue St. Jacques. 
We had hardly left him when we heard a noise, 
and, upon returning, found a dead man on the 
pavement, and the clerk in the hands of the police. 
Looking for the manuscript, we found it on a stone, 
where the clerk had placed it before he stabbed a 
harmless passer-by to death. Of course he was 
again sent to the asylum, where, about ten years 
ago, he killed the director. I do not know whether 
he is still alive, but there can be no doubt that such 
people should be put out of the world.

Formerly such individuals were chained 
like the wild beasts they are, but the super- 
humanitarian principles that make a hero of 
the sane murderer, a martyr of the rapist, and 
an idol of the sodomist, have changed all this. 
There appears to be nothing left in the way 
of protection save capital punishment. As 
Doctor Daremberg justly remarks, "insanity 
is no doubt very interesting, but its phases 
should only be studied where it can be ren- 
dered harmless."

The Opium Habit.— 

An exchange declares the Eastern peniten- 
tiary at Philadelphia has completely cured 
three opium habitues; one had used the drug 
for four, another for thirteen, and the third 
for fifteen years. They had been sentenced 
to serve various terms, and were put in cells 
and treated the same as the other prisoners. 
Of course they suffered, or their appetites 
kicked up a row, but at the expiration of ten 
days they were all right and felt better than 
they had for years. Our contemporary con- 
cludes, therefore, that the way to cure a bad 
habit is to stop it. 

Common Sense.— 

This is a very important attribute for the 
practitioner of medicine, and far more valua- 
ble than abstruse science; yet, as Professor 
Osier pertinently remarks, "it is rare, and 
usually in inverse ratio to the degree of edu- 
cation." 

The aphorism ascribed to the Bard of Avon 
regarding too much learning is exceeding 
apropos to the pathology and therapeutics of 
the last two decades of the nineteenth cen- 
tury. 

Suggestive. — 

Doctor Crothers relates that of fifty eight 
patients treated by him for inebriety, twenty- 
six were Keeley "graduates," and eleven 
more had received some other form of so- 
called "gold cure !" 

Information Wanted.— 

The editor of this journal is in receipt of 
manuscript without title or author, dealing 
with scrofulosis. He would be glad to learn 
the writer's name and residence. 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 

Items and News, 






Where's the '-Tuppence?" — 

Many Ji a certain man went from 

Jerusalem to Jericho, and happened with dis- 
- that are, I hope, well known to all of 
US; and certain religious pr- who found 

him half-dead on the road passed by on the 
other side. But one good Samaritan took 
him to an inn and paid the charges of the 
landlord for looking after him — in advance. 
Nowadays the priest and the Levite would 
have run, if convenient, to the nearest doctor 
and requested him to be the Good Samaritan, 
and would probably have vilified him, either 
publicly or privately, or both, if he did not 
at once drive off to the accident, whatever 
other claims he might have upon him at the 
time. The greater the profession of benevo- 
lence the greater the horror at the request 
of the doctor for that "tuppence." I doubt 
not that most members of our profession, 
indeed all, do their neighborly duty as well 
and as frequently as any other member of 
the community. The rub comes in where we 
are expected to act vicariously for any one 
who chooses to call upon us for this purpose. 
To such we may very well say: "Where is 
your twopence?" I make it a rule never to 
pay any attention to casual messages or 
urgency calls unless to my own patients, or 
when given by some one who is prepared to 
pay my fee. If we would only assert our- 
selves a little more, and let people under- 
stand that we must be paid for our services 
the same as any other profession, there would 
be less difficulty in obtaining our rights. We 
have done so much gratuitously in the past 
that people forget we have our bills, rent, 
rates and taxes to meet the same as others. 
In cases of emergency calls by police or any 
one else, a good working policy is to ask: 
" Where is the tuppence ?" — Doctor B. J i 
in British Medical Journal. 

The Power in Whooping Up.— 

Apropos of the treatment of diphtheria: 
To such an extent has the public been in- 
formed on the subject, and such is the force 
of public opinion, that once the diagnosis of 
diphtheria is made, the treatment settles itself 
— antitoxin must be injected. The patient, 
represented perhaps by his relations or 
friends, is quite as likely to insist on the 
treatment as is the physician. The public 
mind has been as thoroughly educated in this 
direction as pictures and vivid descriptions 
can insure. Newspaper and magazine arti- 
cles on the "great discovery" have been 
numerous; and all the technicalities of the 



THE MEDICAL AGE.

production, and all the details as to the uses 
and effects, of the new specific have been set 
forth with painstaking elaboration and pre- 
cise attention to minutiae, even to the repro- 
duction of photographs of laboratories and 
of the manufacturers themselves. 

We might pause to note the indecent haste 
to attain notoriety that has been exhibited 
by those physicians (scientists?) who have 
contributed such articles to popular maga- 
zines. Such haste is neither creditable to 
medicine nor of real utility to the laity. — Doc- 
tor J. P. Sutherland, before Massachusetts 
Medical Society. 

Don't Mix Medicines.— 

In compounding prescriptions in hot 
weather the physician should have a care 
concerning fermentable and decomposing 
mixtures. One of the commonest is a pre- 
scription containing digestives, such as pepsin, 
with bicarbonate of soda in starchy sub- 
stances or syrups, which in warm weather are 
sure to ferment. It is much better to give 
such agents separately. Some of our com- 
monest drugs mix badly with any agent. 
Cimicifuga precipitates in any liquid mixture 
sooner or later. Hydrastis mixes badly with 
any alkaline excipient, and strophanthus de- 
posits its active principle at once in water. — 
Chicago Medical Times. 

Perennial Flowers. — 

A German chemist has recently traced the 
cause, or rather one of the causes, of flowers 
fading when dried for the herbarium, to the 
ammonia always present in the air. In order 
to obviate this, he presses his specimens be- 
tween sheets of paper which have been pre- 
viously saturated with a one-per-cent. aque- 
ous solution of oxalic acid. The colors are 
said to remain vivid or delicate, like the fresh 
specimens, and to be truly beautiful. The 
acid might be used to advantage in the case 
of red and pink flowers, yet might change 
the blue ones. The experiment can easily be 
tried. — Pacific Druggist. 

riongrel Nomenclature. — 

In a late number of the British Medical 
Journal the eminent Doctor Haig employs, 
unreservedly, "uricacidemia," a wonderful 
combination of two English words and a 
Greek suffix. Hereafter no one will be sur- 
prised to see crop up in medical literature 
such vocabulary beauties as whitebloodcor- 
puscleemia, grapesugaruria, eggwhiteuria, 
gallstoniasis, stomachguttitis, etc. Verily, 
the English language has lost nothing of the 
flexibility and adaptability of vigorous youth. 
— Medical Standard. 



It is a nistake.— 

To pay so much attention to pathology 
and the causes of disease that therapeutics 
must be neglected. From the point of view 
of the invalid it is infinitely more important 
to know the remedy that it is to know the 
microbic or other cause of his disease. 

In Re Antitoxin.— 

It was first alleged that if the serum was 
employed sufficiently early, say the second 
day, the disease would be checked and the 
child saved. Koerte tells us he killed all his 
cases by his early treatment ! — Medical Press 
and Circular. 

Quintuple Birth.— 

An Associated Press dispatch from Char- 
lotte, Prince Edward Island, says Mrs. Alex- 
ander Campbell, of Montague, gave birth to 
five daughters on July 28. Her husband is 
a tailor and is in his eighty-fourth year. 

Size of Drops.— 

The size of drops delivered from a tube is 
determined not by the lumen of the latter 
but by the outside diameter, a fact to which 
Eschbaum has recently called attention. — 
Pharmaceutische Centralhalle. 

Not Quoted in the Chicago flarket.— 

The smallest known species of the genus 
Sus is the pigmy hog of Australia. It re- 
sembles its larger brethren exactly in all but 
size, being not larger than a good-sized 
house-rat. — Exchange. 

The Weapon of the Bee.— 

When compared with the point of a fine 
needle, under a powerful microscope, the 
sting of the bee is hardly discernible. — The 
point of the needle appears to be about an 
inch in diameter. 

Honors to Doctor J. Collins Warren.— 

Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, 
has conferred the honorary degree of LL.D. 
upon this gentleman, the well known Profes- 
sor of Surgery at Harvard University. 

What Next?— 

The "bicycle face," haggard and ashen, 
has been discovered by an English M.D. 

A Pathognomonic Symptom.— 

Belief in serum therapy is an infallible 
symptom of intellectual degeneracy. 

Never— 

Give a drug without a well defined reason 
for so doing.

Therapeutic Brevities. 

Palmetto and Pick* in StrUtun 

thra. — D. A , aged 30, complained of 

ling, doubth 

the result of cauterization for gonorrhoea. 

Whenever his urine became acrid from c 

- &gt;f urates or stimulating foods or drinks, 
he found it almost impossible to void it, and 

lired nearly ten minutes to accomplish a 
'.e evacuation. On one occasion, after a 
thorough use of non-irritating cathartic pdls, 
he had been able to make a stream full and 
free for a day or two, after which the former 
strictured condition again obtained. I found 
great tenderness, irritation and induration of 
the prostate gland, and perineal pain reflected 
from the seat of stricture. An attempt to 
pass a No. 3 or 4 bougie proved perfectly 
abortive, nor would the stricture yield to 
persistent pressure against the resisting tis- 
sues. The bougie passed freely and pain- 
lessly along the urethra until the membranous 
portion was reached, when, with a painfui 
spasm, its further progress was instantly and 
effectually stayed. 

A brief course of tentative treatment cor- 
roborated my diagnosis, and I proceeded to 
treat him as follows: A narrow strip of irri- 
tating plaster was held in contact with the 
shaven surface over the prostate by means 
of a neatly adjusted perineal bandage; fresh 
plaster was applied from time to time until 
pustulation and suppuration followed its ap- 
plication. Compound podophyllin pills were 
given short of catharsis until there was visible 
improvement in the physical and chemical 
condition of the urine, after which I put him 
on elixir of Saw Palmetto and Pichi. Also 
one-half teaspoonful every six hours of a 
mixture of tincture of stillingia (2), fluid ex- 
tract digitalis (1), tincture honey bee (^2), 
and simple syrup to make 16 parts. Under 
this treatment the improvement was marked, 
and in two weeks a No. 4 bougie could be 
readily and painlessly passed, and at the close 
of the third week there was no appreciable 
impediment to the passage of the urine. — 
Doctor Rutherford, in Virginia Medical 
Monthly. 



Lactic Acid in Epithelioma of Face. — In 
November last I was called to see a patient, 
aged 65 years, who for five or six years had 
a sore situated on the cheek, and that within 
three months had begun to develop very 
rapidly. Prior to this it had gone through 
the usual characteristics of a slow-growing 
epithelioma. The ulcer was unusually thick- 
ened and indurated, its cavity about the size 



of a silver dollar, fully two-thirds of the sur- 
pied by an elevated, indurated, 

thickened, characteristic wall. Remember- 
tig Moorhoff stion that 

Arid has the power of attacking and 

destroying cancerous growths without injur- 
ing healthy tissues, 1 concluded to resort to 
this agent, ami accordingly had it prepared 
in the form of a pa s r With silicic acid, 

and of a strength of about fifty or sixty per 
cent. Patient suffered very little pain from 
this; indeed, at no time was the suffering 
very acute. At the end of a week the 
strength of the paste was increased, and the 
application continued every day. Soon the 
surface of the sore began to granulate; the 
walls broke down like magic; and when 
the patient was discharged, in the succeed- 
ing January, there remained only a perfectly 
clean cicatrix, smooth and somewhat reddish, 
about the size of a penny. Note that in six 
or seven weeks from the first application the 
man was entirely well. — Doctor I. M. Bi 

in Journal of Cutaneous and Genito- Urinary 
Diseases. 



Breivers Yeast in Diabetes.— At the French 
Congress of Internal Medicine, Cassaet pro- 
fessed to have obtained good results in dia- 
betes by the administration of brewers' Yeast 
in a daily dose of 750 grains, although the 
substance could not be continued sufficiently 
long on account of the practical difficulty in 
summer of preventing acetous or putrid fer- 
mentation. It was taken readily by the pa- 
tients, the immediate effect being the expul- I 
sion of a very large quantity of gas by fl 
eructation; then, in the course of the first or I 
second day, extremely foetid diarrhoea with I 
abundant gas. After a few days tolerance \ 
is established, the general state of the patient ' 
improves: appetite returns, strength increases, I 
and pain diminishes. The weight of the three I 
patients in whom the treatment was tried in- - 
creased three, five, and eight pounds respec- 
tively after the Yeast had been administered I 
for a' fortnight— a gain particularly remarka- 
ble, inasmuch as one was phthisical as well 
as diabetic, and another had diabetes of the 
gravest type. On discontinuing the treat- 
ment, loss of weight was soon observed. 
The proportion of urea in urine remained 
stationary or increased; the proportion of 
sugar diminished in one case by three-fourths 
and in another by two-thirds in the fortnight.

entirely disappeared, and in the others a 
notable reduction in size ensued. He ad- 
ministered from twenty-eight to forty-five 
drachms, extending over from nineteen to 
forty-three days. In four of the five patients 
there was a diminution of body-weight. — 77 
Polidinico. 

Doctor Ferdinand Winkler carefully re- 
views the literature of Thyroid, and remarks 
the noticeable results in myxcedema are: 
Diuresis; diminution of the myxomatous 
swelling; lessening of body-weight; disap- 
pearance of weariness, stiffness, and apathy. 
In obesity notable diminution of body-weight 
has been obtained, and may even be more 
marked than when dietetics alone are relied 
upon; the somatic and psychic phenomena 
of cretinism are often markedly benefited; in 
tetany good results have been claimed by 
Gottstein; in exophthalmic goitre and acro- 
megaly it apparently produces no good re- 
sults; a few cases of psoriasis have been 
benefited, but lichen planus, lupus, eczema, 
urticaria, prurigo, and acne rosacea are not 
influenced; Menzies found great benefit in 
six cases of rupia syphilitica, and Abraham 
a marked improvement in two patients suf- 
fering from leprosy. — Centralblatt fiir die 
Gesammte Therapie. 



Taka- Diastase. — Doctor Ferdinand Lascar 
recalls the fact that diastase has an action 
upon starch identical with ptyalin. Diastase 
is contained in a greater or less extent in the 
different extracts of malt, but in them its 
utility as a starch-converting agent will always 
remain a limited one. The diastase now 
made by Takamine is a dry powder, tasteless, 
of no perceptible odor, and powerful enough 
to convert one hundred times its weight of 
starch into a soluble condition. Doctor Las- 
car finds that it will convert fifty per cent, more 
than is claimed for it. One of the peculiari- 
ties of this product is the rapidity with which 
the conversion takes place, four minutes being 
sufficient so fully to produce the change that 
neither iodine or the microscope can detect 
unconverted starch. In the making of the tests, 
as well as in the manufacture of the product, 
heat should be guarded against, as it easily 
destroys the action of diastase. The field of 
usefulness of this product is not alone in in- 
fant-feeding, but as well in the amylaceous 
dyspepsias of adults, which are by no means 
infrequent. — Therapeutic Gazette. 



relaxing spasmodically contracted unstriated 
muscles and dilating peripheral vessels. 
These qualities suggest the employment of 
Chloral hydrate in several conditions where 
hitherto it has been little thought of. Asso- 
ciated with iodide of potassium it is of ser- 
vice in bronchial asthma; and Doctor J. Pal 
has used it in the form of enemata (fifteen to 
twenty grains in each) for checking haemop- 
tysis; here it is assumed to act by the revul- 
sion which it produces in dilating the cutane- 
ous vessels. On the same principle it is 
employed by Doctor Cherchevsky, in small 
doses daily, to counteract the coldness of the 
feet and hands which is so disagreeable a 
symptom in certain cases of anaemia, neuras- 
thenia, etc.; he also employs its vaso-dilator 
function in the treatment of aortic aneurysm, 
where even a dose of two or three grains 
combined with iodide of potassium assists 
the action of the latter and keeps up a cer- 
tain degree of peripheral vascular relaxation.

Curetting Cornea in Pterygium. — Raise the 
ptergyium from its position with the fine- 
toothed forceps; detach by shaving the cornea 
with a small bistoury, or excise by a single 
cut of the scissors, or by two converging 
cuts, one superior and one inferior. Now fix 
the eyeball with forceps, and very carefully 
and vigorously curette the corneal wound, 
commencing at the summit. By this method 
the cornea is completely cleaned, recovery 
takes place promptly, with no cicatricial 
opacity and no scar to be eliminated, which 
too frequently leaves a cloudiness of the 
cornea. Careful and vigorous curetting of 
the cornea should take the place of the 
galvano-cautery; it disinfects the entire de- 
nuded surface as well as any other method, 
and has the advantage of leveling it exactly 
and not destroying healthy portions of the 
organ. A simple conjunctival autoplasty by 
simple sliding may be performed. A few 
small liberating incisions with scissors enable 
one, if necessary, to free tense portions which 
are drawn by the sutures. — Doctor Des- 
CHAMPS, in Annates dOculistique. 



Value of Chloral. — It is unfortunate this 
drug has been so distinctly labeled "hypnotic 
and sedative," as this action has thrown into 
the shade the marked power possessed of 



Thyroid in Myxcedema. — Doctor Shurly, of 
Detroit, at a recent meeting of the American 
Laryngological Association, related a case in 
which, some fifteen years ago, Doctor T. A. 
McGraw, for the relief of goitre, extirpated 
the whole thyroid gland in a boy sixteen 
years of age. Three or four years later 
Doctor Shurly found the vocal cords and 
arytenoids normal in movement, but defec-

tive in tension. From this time on the pa- 
tient gradually acquired myxcedema; his 

mental faculties had not developed to any 
extent. For threi mow he 

taking T! tract continuously; te 

of the vocal cords is much better, and his 
mental faculties are somewhat improved 
although the mind acts very sluggishly. The 
profession should use its influence against 
extirpation of the whole of the thyroid gland, 
in the light of our present knowledge. — 
rican Journal of the Medical Sciences. 



Menthol in Diphtheria. — Kastorsky reports 
thirty seven cases of diphtheria treated and 
cured by painting with a ten-per-cent. alco- 
holic solution of Menthol; marked improve- 
ment in the general condition was invariably 
noticed from the beginning of the treatment. 
The paintings, by means of a piece of cotton- 
wool, were usually carried out three times 
daily, and in some cases a single free appli- 
cation was followed by complete disappear- 
ance of false membranes within two days. 
The same simple method was invariably 
practiced by the author in numerous cases 
of anginas of various forms, and by Tritovsky 
in a group of cases of scarlatinal diphtheria. 
The paintings are said to be painless and 
quite harmless. — The Lancet (London). 



Oenothera Biennis. — Evening Primrose is a 
very valuable remedy for distress after eat- 
ing, and for diarrhoea and dysentery, espe- 
cially in children. 

About four months ago a man 65 years 
old, troubled with severe pains in his stom- 
ach after meals for over two years, solicited 
relief. I gave him Primrose, and in about an 
hour he was free from pain and wanted to 
know what he could eat, declaring he had 
dieted so long and eaten so little he was 
nearly starved. I told him to eat anything 
he liked, but take the medicine in a little 
water after each meal. He has never been 
troubled with stomach-ache since. — Doctor 
D. L. Hurd, in Chicago Medical Times. 



7 caching Children to Talk Correctly. — If the 
proper effort is made in children from two to 
five years of age, it is in no way difficult to 
correct defective pronunciation. The fault 
usually lies in the necessity of the child's 
learning how to correctly pronounce certain 
sounds which to him seem to be more or less 
difficult or which have been incorrectly 
learned. A little practice on consonant 
sounds will sometimes correct many defects. 
The idea that "tongue tie" is to blame for 



defects of speech is usually erroneous It is 
surprising how quickly a little meth. 
education will permanently correct d&lt; 
of speech, and this is almost equally true of 
stammering. — Chicago Medical Times. 



Lamium Album. — Florain declares the 
soma of this plant constitute a hemostatic of 
the first order. The remedy is efficacious in 
bronchial and uterine haemorrhage where er- 
gotin, tannic acid and the like have been 
used without success. In metrorrhagia the 
syrupy extract of the blossoms was used. 

One part of the tincture to five parts of 
syrup and two-and-a-half parts water, IS 
vised in half-teaspoonful or coffeespoonful 
doses, every half-hour until the internal 
bleeding ceases, after which a tablespoonful 
should be given every four hours until all 
the symptoms have disappeared. — M 
Standard. 



Severe Epistaxis. — Severe bleeding from the 
erectile tissues of the nose is best checked 
by positive interstitial electrolysis, which can 
be employed whether the haemorrhage is 
from a small or from a large area. Silver or 
copper needles are most efficacious. The 
current ought to run from sixteen to twenty 
milliamperes, and each seance last from eight 
to ten minutes. In exceptional cases three 
or four sittings may be necessary. Haemo- 
stasis can be brought about without bad re- 
sults, though there exist between this region 
and the brain important vascular relations. — 
Miot, in Revue Internationale de Rhinologie. 



Post-Partum Hceviorrhage. — Try, first, ex- 
ternal stimulation, then bimanual stimula- 
tion: Second, ice internally and externally; 
throw ether on abdomen: Third, handker- 
chief soaked in vinegar squeezed dry at 
fundus of uterus: Fourth, inject hot water, 
120 : Fifth, electricity: Finally, tampon 
uterus with gauze. 

It is rare one is required to go farther than 
combined internal and external stimulation. 
The intra-uterine gauze tampon will always 
stop haemorrhage, but should never be used 
except as a last resort. — Canadian Practi- 
tioner. 



Fallacies. — A writer in the American Jour- 
nal of Pharmacy points out the fallacy of the 
oft-repeated statement that lithic urate is 
more soluble than any of the urate salts, and 
therefore lithia-water is suitable to gouty 
patients and others who suffer from a super- 
abundance of lithic acid; also the erroneous

assumption that the exhibiting of chlorate 
of potassium in blood poisoning will oxydize 
and destroy the poison in the blood. The 
fact is, as any chemist knows, that in an 
alkaline solution like the blood, chlorate of 
potassium is practically stable and conse- 
quently inert. — Western Druggist. 



A Rational Aphrodisiac. — Quackish things 
in this line constantly cropping up, deter- 
mines me to mention a tonic combination 
which, properly used, will not fail to benefit 
cases rightfully requiring such treatment: 
Strychnine sulphate, one grain; phosphorus, 
pure, one-half grain; atropine sulphate, one- 
third grain; resin cannabis, two and one- 
eighth grains. Make ioo pills, and give one 
or two from three to six times a day as re- 
quired. When once an effect is produced 
they should be given less frequently. — W. C. 
Abbott, in Texas Courier of Medicine. 



Circumcision. — I wish to enter a protest 
against the custom of universal and indis- 
criminate circumcision of male infants. It 
should be the duty of the attending physician 
to reflect the prepuce of all male children 
when they are a month old, relieve the cor- 
ona glandis of the smegma present, anoint it 
with olive oil or vaselin, and replace the 
foreskin. This should be repeated two or 
three times a month by the mother, and the 
parts cleansed. — H. E. Tuley, in Archives of 
Pediatrics. 



Jaundice after Male- Fern. — Grawitz has 
frequently observed jaundice to follow the 
administration of male-fern; the active agent 
in producing this is filicic acid, and as this is 
more readily absorbed when dissolved in 
fatty oils, he questions the wisdom of giving 
male-fern with castor oil. He also concludes 
that it is dangerous to give it to patients with 
hepatic cirrhosis, and quotes three such cases 
where the dose was followed by fatal results. 
— Glasgow Medical Journal. 



Boils in the Gouty. — Among gouty persons 
who are attacked with successive crops of 
boils, but who have neither diabetes nor al- 
buminuria, extract of Colchicum in quantities 
of from half a grain to two-thirds of a grain 
a day gives favorable and sometimes surpris- 
ing results. As a local treatment daily appli- 
cations of a strong tincture of Camphor are 
advised; the furuncles should also be cov- 
ered with pieces of Vidal's red plaster. — M. 
Brocq, in Lyon Medical. 



Scarlatina. — A writer in La Semaine Medi- 
cate recommends chloral for calming children 
suffering with this malady. It is a drug that 
is generally excellently borne by children, 
and a well known rough method of calculat- 
ing the dose is to give one grain for every 
year of the child's age, up to ten years. The 
syrup should be prescribed, and given with 
soda-water or lemonade. — The Practitioner. 



Substitute for Iodoform. — The following 
will be found as efficacious as iodoform in 
the dressing of wounds: 

]£ Powdered camphor, 4 parts. 
Bismuth subcarbonate, 4 parts. 
Sulphur, 24 parts. 

— Medical Week. 



Drugs Contra-i?idicated during Pregnancy. — 
At the head of dangerous substances for the 
pregnant woman may be placed sodium sali- 
cylate, ergot, salicylic acid, and salol; then 
come purgatives, antipyrin, acetanilid, sulpho- 
nal, and cocaine. — M. Huguenin. 



Arsenic in Sarcoma. — In a case of giant- 
celled sarcoma, from five to ten pills contain- 
ing one-twenty-fifth of a grain of Arsenous 
acid were given every day for two years, with 
a complete cure as the result. — New York 
Medical Times. 



Quinine for Ulcerations. — In simple or in- 
fectious ulcers a simple wash of a one-per- 
cent, solution of the sulphate of Quinine 
produces most excellent results. — Lyon Medi- 
cal. 



Rheumatic Arthritis. — An excellent appli- 
cation is of a cloth wet in a strong solution 
made by dissolving salt in boiling vinegar. — 
Reviezv of Medicine. 



Antitoxin. — The universal verdict concern- 
ing antitoxin seems to be that the treatment 
is worse than the disease. — Medical Brief. 



Furuncles. — A Chloral solution kept con- 
stantly applied to a boil is said to be of great 
advantage. — Exchange. 



Nuclein. — This gives prompt and decided 
results in malarial fever. — Doctor Wilson, 
in Southern Clinic.

Medical Progress. 



Renai PATHOL( »GY. — Two interesting con- 
tribut this subject appeared recently 

in the Wiener Klimsche A'- from the 

pens of Semmola and Kreuml. It has been 
held that the albuminuria of renal di- 

- from disturbance of the glomerular 

circulation, or structural changes in the kid- 
ney tissues generally, tubules as well as 
glomeruli. Semmola argues that the pri- 
mary change is in the proteids of the blood 
plasma becoming more or less diffusible; he 
founds this opinion on the results following 
the experimental injection of egg-albumen, 
and holds that this produces not only albu- 
minuria, but other phenomena seen in Bright's 
disease, such as albuminuric retinitis for in- 
stance, and that these results are all due to 
the circulation in the blood of a so-called 
tozalbumen. It is certainly a fact of con- 
siderable interest that the repeated subcu- 
taneous injection of egg-albumen should, in 
seven or eight weeks, produce changes of the 
retina and optic disc; but the real point is 
whether the retinitis is not due to the sec- 
ondary effects produced by the damaged 
kidneys, rather than to the presence of the 
albumen in the circulation. Freund details 
his own experience — that the proportion of 
globulin to albumen in the blood-serum is as 
one to two, or even as one to three, — but 
does not regard this as specific of Bright's 
disease, as he found somewhat similar pro- 
portions in pernicious anasmia. He also dis- 
covered that the coagulation temperature 
both of blood-serum and of the serous exu- 
dations in Bright's disease is higher than 
that of normal serum. Finally, he experi- 
mented on the diffusibility of the serum in 
seventeen cases of chronic parenchymatous 
nephritis, with the result that, although 
the blood-serum underwent changes, such 
scarcely afforded evidence sufficient to estab- 
lish the view that morbus Brightii is primarily 
a blood disease. 

The observations of Shafer and Oliver on the 
physiology of the supra-renal bodies {Journal 
of Physiology] throw new light on Addison's 
disease. It was found the supra-renal bodies 
elaborate a substance which has a very pow- 
erful action on muscular tissues, and more 
especially on the muscular coat of arteries; 
in very small doses it causes an enormous 
heightening of the blood-pressure, dependent 
upon contraction of the peripheral vessels, 
due to a direct action of the substance on 
the muscular coat, and not to any action on 
the medullary vaso-motor centre; it also acts 
directly on the heart, producing augmenta- 



tion and acceleration, provided the

are obtained in rabbits than in dog 
the former the respirations are temporarily 
arrested, in the latter they are rendered shal- 
lower. The active principle of the supra- 
renal substance is only found in the medul- 
lary portion of the gland, and its activity is 

lestroyed by dilute mineral acids, by 
boiling unless very prolonged, nor by ; 
digestion; alkalies, however, diminish its po- 
tency. In cases of Addison's disease, no 
physiological action was obtained from the 
extract of the diseased capsules. It is thus 
clear that these glands have an internal secre- 
tion, and it is possible that the phenomena of 
Addison's disease are entirely or in part due 
to the absence of this active principle. The 
muscular and circulatory weakness would at 
any rate thus receive an explanation. As yet 
no very striking therapeutic success has been 
achieved in Addison's disease by the injection 
of supra-renal extract, and in fact it is re- 
markable that it is only in myxcedema that 
good and striking results have been obtained 
by the use of animal extracts. This failure 
suggests that in other maladies, such as dia- 
betes, Addison's disease, etc., there must be 
some other factor at work besides the defi- 
ciency of a normal internal secretion. — The 
Practitioner. 



Late Suppers. — The old tradition that to 
eat anything just before going to bed was 
sure to produce indigestion and render sleep 
impossible, is now happily exploded. It is 
not good, as a matter of fact, to go to bed 
with the stomach so loaded that the un- 
digested food will render one restless, but 
something of a light, palatable nature in the 
stomach is one of the best aids to quietude 
and rest. The process of digestion goes on 
in sleep with as much regularity as when one 
is taking violent exercise to aid it, and so 
something in the stomach is a very desirable 
condition for the night's rest. Some physi- 
cians have declared, indeed, that a good deal 
of the prevalent insomnia is the result of an 
unconscious craving of the stomach for food 
in persons who have been unduly frightened 
by the opinion that they must not eat before 
going to bed, or who have, like many nervous 
women, been keeping themselves in a state 
of semi-starvation. 

Nothing is more agreeable on retiring for 
the night than to take a bowl of hot broth, 
like oatmeal gruel or clam soup. It is a

positive aid to nervous people, and induces 
peaceful slumbers. This is especially the 
case of cold winter nights, when the stomach 
craves warmth as much as any other part of 
the body. Even a glass of hot milk is 
grateful to the palate on such occasions, but 
a light, well cooked gruel is better, and in 
our climate, during the cold months of winter, 
should be the retiring food of every woman 
who feels, as many do, the need of food at 
night. — Canada Lancet. 



house. On the other hand, in houses where 
some children were vaccinated and some 
were not, the disease without exception at- 
tacked the latter, and the former escaped.— 
The Lancet (London). 



Epithelioma Following Skin-grafting. 
— At a recent meeting of the New York 
Pathological Society, Doctor E. K. Dunham 
presented a woman of 53, in whom an adher- 
ent cicatrix, formed in 1872, had broken 
down, and an ulcer formed which never 
healed. Last year this ulcer was thoroughly 
scraped, and three months later, while granu- 
lating, was grafted with skin. Thirty days 
thereafter she was discharged "cured," all 
of the grafts having taken except one small 
spot. In February, 1895, she was readmitted, 
the ulcer having reopened, being also covered 
with unhealthy granulations. A portion was 
excised for examination, and presented an 
admixture of spiculse of bone and epithelium, 
some in nests and some containing pearl 
bodies. 

Doctor Ferguson thought it fairly common 
for such epithelial tumors to follow quite a 
number of years after the injuries; chronic 
ulcers on the front of the leg became epi- 
theliomatous in many individuals. This 
statement, he said, could probably be verified 
by the records of any of our hospitals. — 
Medical Record. 



Proof of the Value of Vaccination. — 
Scotin, of Russia, noting that an epidemic 
of smallpox was approaching the district 
under his charge, personally examined every 
child under fourteen years of age. Seventy- 
five were said to have been vaccinated, but 
no scars were visible; 424 had never been 
vaccinated. The smallpox arrived and a wide- 
spread although not very fatal epidemic re- 
sulted. Of the 1055 " vaccinated " children, 
only 16 contracted the disease; of the 75 
"doubtful," 35 suffered; of the 434 "unvac- 
cinated," 244 caught the disease. In other 
words, the unvaccinated suffered to an extent 
forty-five times as great as the vaccinated. 

Further, it was observed that in 189 fami- 
lies all the children were unvaccinated, and 
in these families if one child sickened with the 
smallpox the disease spread, with only seven- 
teen exceptions, to every other child in the 



A New Symptom of Cancer.— A woman, 
aged 48, suffered from cancer of the stomach ; 
the disease had gone through a long period 
of latency. She presented on each cheek a 
patch of wine-red discoloration formed by 
the dilatation of the superficial venules, that 
showed out sharply against the pale yellow of 
the surrounding skin. On the strength of 
this symptom alone I was able to make di- 
agnosis of probable cancer at a time when 
there was yet no other manifest sign of this 
affection. Such superficial varicosities on 
the cheeks are a valuable help to the early 
recognition of certain cancers, and I have 
found them in about two-thirds of the cases 
which have come under my observation; 
they are particularly frequent in cases of epi- 
thelioma of the stomach and uterus, but less 
common in malignant diseases of other or- 
gans. — Doctor Bogdan, in British Medical 
Journal. 

Aneurysm of the Hepatic Artery. — 
Mester reports the case of a man of 42 who 
was kicked in the abdomen by a horse, and 
who experienced pain in the hypochondrium, 
intermittent icterus, vomiting of blood, and 
passing of fresh or altered blood by rectum. 
The diagnosis was ulcer of the duodenum. 
Laparotomy failed to reveal seat of haemor- 
rhage, nevertheless gastroenterostomy was 
performed, the patient dying a few days 
later. Autopsy showed a spurious aneurysm 
of the right branch of the hepatic artery, in 
the liver tissue and communicating with the 
right branch of the hepatic duct. 

Analysis of the nineteen cases previously 
reported shows that the diagnosis is never 
made during life, the condition being mis- 
taken for ulcer of the duodenum or gall- 
stone. — American Journal of the Medical 
Sciences. 



To Practice Deep Breathing. — Stand 
erect, the feet separated, the right slightly in

Priapism ix Leukemia. — Priapism sud- 
denly appeared in a man of 42, without ap- 
parent cause. After two months the erection 
slowly subsided, leaving complete loss of 
sexual feeling, that never returned. At this 
time leukaemia was easily recognized by the 
greatly enlarged spleen and the condition of 
the blood — 4,080.000 red to 960,000 white 
corpuscles. Six months later the' patient 
died. It was found that the cavernous bodies 
had been the seat of extensive white thrombi, 
which had been followed by connective-

giving a mechanical explanation of this rare

Respire 1 or y Capacity. — Enlarged breath- 
ing capacity is desirable for many reasons. It 
not only insures an abundant supply of oxy- 
gen — which may be called its direct effect — 
but, indirectly, it produces results of great 
aesthetic value. It deepens and broadens the 
chest, causing the figure to become more 
erect, the step more elastic and vigorous, 
and the carriage of the body more pleasing I

What the Tongue Indicates. — A white 
tongue denotes a febrile disturbance; a brown, 
moist tongue — indigestion; a brown, dry 
tongue — depression, blood poisoning, typhoid 
fever; a red, moist tongue — inflammatory 
fever; a red, glazed tongue — general fever, 
loss of digestion; a tremulous, moist, and 
flabby tongue — feebleness, nervousness; a 
glazed tongue with blue appearance — ter- 
tiary syphilis. 

A Telling Blow. — Another bulwark of 
bacteriology is gone. The primary postulate 
upon which the fledgeling science chiefly 
rested, was that a specific germ causes a 
specific disease. Now, recent investigations 
show that so-called specific germs may be 
found anywhere in the body, without regard 
to the nature of the lesion, if their natural 
pabulum, dead tissue, exists. 



Tabes Dorsalis. — If a person has parox- 
ysmal vomiting and complains occasionally

frequently be surprised at the ease with which 
you can make the diagnosis. — Doctor Hirt.

OUTLINES OF SANITARY ORGANIZATION 

OF SOME OF THE GREAT ARMIES 

OF THE WORLD.* 

BY MAJOR JOHN VAN RENSSELAER HOFF, SUR- 
GEON U. S ARMY. 

{Continued from page J £5.) 

VI. THE AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN ARMY. 

In peace the Sanitary Corps consists of 
the headquarters and twenty-six sections; in 
war, in addition, there are field and reserve 
sanitary sections formed upon "cadre" fur- 
nished from the peace establishment, and 
sanitary sections from the hospitals of the 
order of Teutonic Knights. 

Each Sanitary Section is assigned to a gar- 
rison hospital, and is known by its number, 
which is identical with that of the military 
division to which it is attached. The Sani- 
tary Corps is commanded by a special corps 
of non-medical officers, eighty-three in num- 
ber, and comprises besides 2834 men; in war 
it embraces 400 officers and 21,200 men. 

Military Sanitary Establishments] for the 
reception and treatment of the sick and 
wounded, are divided into: Permanent 
Sanitary Establishments, consisting of the 
garrison hospitals and branches, troop hos- 
pitals, infirmaries, military bathing and water- 
cure establishments, and fortress hospitals; 
and Field Sanitary Establishments, consist- 
ing of divisional sanitary establishments, 
field hospitals, field infirmaries, reserve hos- 
pitals (on the theatre of war), halting-places 
for the wounded on the line of march, and 
field ambulances (railway, ship-ambulances,

geons.

Cavalry, Military Attache at Vienna, Austria. 



etc.). In the field sanitary establishments 
may also be included the reserve hospitals 
exterior to the theatre of war, the reserve 
hospitals and convalescent establishments 
provided by patriotic societies or private in- 
dividuals, and, finally, the ''Clothing and 
Sanitary Material Field Depots." Divisional 
sanitary establishments belong to the reserve 
of the first line; the remaining establish- 
ments to the reserve of the second line. 

The Military Sanitary Establishments are 
under the direction of military medical offi- 
cers, and are assigned to divisions of sanitary 
troops, or men who have been trained as 
"bandage- and litter-bearers, for carrying out 
the hospital service." The sick, wounded, 
and hospital personnel are required to obey 
all orders given by medical officers pertain- 
ing to the sick and to the performance of 
duties in the hospital. The senior medical 
officer is, however, only invested with discip- 
linary power of punishment over his subor- 
dinate medical officers, except when in charge 
of a railway or ship ambulance, when he also 
exercises this power over the enlisted sanitary 
personnel. 

The military command over the entire 
personnel of each establishment belonging to 
the combatant strength of the Army, is exer- 
cised by the commandant of the sanitary 
division attached to the hospital. Those es- 
tablishments which have no sanitary divi- 
sions are assigned regimental subaltern offi- 
cers for the exercise of military command, 
who have the disciplinary power of punish- 
ment over the personnel of the hospital be- 
longing to the combatant strength of the 
Army. 

The reports and records of a sanitary es- 
tablishment are signed jointly by the senior 
medical officer, and commandant of the sani- 
tary division; but matters pertaining solely 
to the functions of either require only the 
signature of the one concerned.

THE MEDICAL AGE. 



I first in the Per- 
manent Military Sanitary Establishment, and 

rganized at all la i stations, 

and. in addition to other purposes, are charged 
with the training of surgeon volunteers for 
the medical service and the assistant sanitary 

personnel. At present there are twenty-six of 

spitals — two in Vienna, two in Pesth, 
one each at Linz, Olmutz, Theresianstadt. 
Bruner, Comorn, Loibash, Trieste, Ragusa, 
and Mostar, and one at each of the head- 
quarter stations of the ist, 3d, 5th, and 13th 
Corps; some have branches. They are num- 
bered consecutively: for example, "Garrison 
;. Gran," "Garrison Hospital 
No. ii, Prague— Branch Headochin." On 
mobilization, the garrison hospitals furnish 
the divisional sanitary establishments, field 
hospitals, railway sanitary trains, and ship- 
ambulaii' 

Every hospital is an independent estab- 
lishment, under its own staff of medical offi- 
cers, chaplains, and accountant officers, ami 
a sanitary division. A medical officer, with 
the rank of field officer, is in charge, and a 
captain or lieutenant of the " Armee Stand" 
superintends the administration and econom- 
ical service. — The latter duties, in the case of 
the smaller garrison hospitals, are performed 
by an officer of the sanitary division. There 
is likewise an apothecary attached to every 
garrison hospital. In military and administra- 
tive matters these hospitals are subordinate to 
the brigade commanders. They are enlarged 
on mobilization to afford accommodations 
for a maximum of 1000 patients. 

The personnel of the Vienna hospital con- 
sists of twelve medical officers, two officers 
of the Armee Stand, one chaplain, one ac- 
countant officer, sixteen officers' servants, 
four principal division officers, 190 principal 
division men, one instruction division officer, 
fifty-nine instruction division men, — total, 
twenty-one officers and 265 men. This is 
the largest hospital in the Kmpire. The 
smallest garrison hospital, at Ragusa, has a 
personnel of three medical officers, one chap- 
lain, one accountant officer, five officers' 
servants, two principal division officers, 
thirty-four principal division men, one in- 
struction division officer, seventeen instruc- 
tion division men, — total, eight officers and 
fifty-six men. The total strength of the 



twentj trnson hospitals amounts to 

274 officers and 3025 men. 

\ Troop Hospital is established at &lt; 
military station possessed of a garrison of 
more than 500 men that has no permanent 
garrison hospital and is charged with the 
treatment of the ill and the training of litter- 
and bandage-bearers (one non-commissioned 
officerand three privates per company). They 
are independent establishments, with an or- 
ganization similar to that of a garrison hospi- 
tal, but their staff is not exclusively attached 
to them, but is furnished from the regiment 
or corps from which their patients come. A 
regimental medical officer is in charge, and a 
line officer is assigned for the supervision of 
military order and discipline, as well as for 
the management of economical administra- 
tion. The nurses and attendants are detailed 
generally from those members of regiments 
who have been trained as bandage- and litter- 
bearers, but are sometimes furnished by the 
sanitary troops (a regular organization, one 
section of which is attached to each army 
corps). On mobilization the troop hospitals 
are enlarged for the reception of the sick and 
wounded, and are designated Reserve Hos- 
pitals, or Fortress Hospitals in case they are 
located in fortified places. Additional troop 
hospitals are organized in some of the recruit- 
ing-district stations, to provide for the in- 
creased demands incidental to the mobiliza- 
tion of the Army. The hospitalsof the military 
schools, of the invalids, and of the military 
prisons are organized on a similar model, but 
form an integral part of these establishments. 
The invalid hospital at Thenau has a special 
branch for the treatment of the insane. 

In garrisons numbering from 300 to 500 
men, Military Infirmaries may be established 
by order of the military territorial command- 
ers, for the reception and treatment of light' 
cases, and of severe cases where removal to r 
regular hospital is not possible. Infirmaries 
may also be established on special occasions, 
such as a large concentration of troops or the 
breaking out of epidemic or contagious dis- 
eases, for such periods as may be necessary. 
The medical officer in charge, and the hospi- 
tal personnel, are detailed from the strength of 
the regiments; and a line officer is assigned 
for the supervision of the military and admin- 
istrative service. The duties of nurses and

611 



attendants are generally performed by ban- 
dage-bearers, and exceptionally by sanitary- 
soldiers. As the military infirmaries form 
subdivisions of their respective regiments, 
those located in the receiving districts are 
enlarged on mobilization or disbanded if not 
required. 

Military Bathing and Water Cure Estab- 
lishments are organized at the more import- 
ant springs, as Baden (near Vienna), Karsl- 
bad, Schonau (near Toplitz in Bohemia), 
Mehodia, Hof-Gastein, Pystian, Toplitz in 
Hungary, Buda-Pesth, Topulsko in Croatia, 
and Toplitz in Corinthia, but are for the 
treatment of special cases. Some receive 
only officers; some both officers and men; 
some only men; and they vary in system and 
treatment. Most of these are open only dur- 
ing the summer season, and are provided 
with the necessary staff and attendants from 
the garrison hospitals or from the sanitary 
troops. Every establishment is under the 
direction of a medical officer. In Karlsbad, 
Schonau, and Mehodia, field officers of the 
retired list are permanently in charge as 
" Military Bath-house Commandants;" in the 
other cures, officers are detailed as com- 
mandants during the bathing season as 
"Military Bath-Inspectors." In war, the 
military bathing establishments may be en- 
larged for the reception of the sick and 
wounded from the front. 

In those fortresses of the Empire which 
are in a state of preparation for defense, 
such as Cracow, Przemysl, etc., provision for 
hospital accommodation is based upon the 
requirements of their increased garrison on 
mobilization. Fortresses which contain gar- 
rison hospitals enlarge them, and eventually 
establish branches sufficient for the reception 
of a maximum of iooo patients, but when 
the number exceeds this figure Fortress Hos- 
pitals are established. Fortresses which have 
troop hospitals or infirmaries in time of peace, 
convert them into fortress hospitals on mo- 
bilization. Those which have small garri- 
sons, and insufficient even for the erection of 
fortress hospitals, enlarge their infirmaries to 
the extent that may be necessary. Fortress 
hospitals are administrative and independent 
sanitary establishments, and have a special 
personnel attached to them. 

The passage from the peace to the war 



establishment is effected by organizing the 
divisional sanitary establishments and field 
hospitals, railway sanitary trains, and ship- 
ambulances, preparing halting-stations on 
the lines of communication for the wounded, 
furnishing the clothing and sanitary material ; 
and finally by enlarging the fortress sanitary 
establishments. 

The principal object of the sanitary service 
in the field is to transport the wounded from 
the battle-field as rapidly as possible to the 
sanitary establishments in the rear, where 
they may receive thorough surgical treat- 
ment and regular hospital care; and to dis- 
tribute the sick and wounded over as large 
an area as possible in the interior of the 
Empire. The wounded are first collected by 
the litter-bearers, and given such assistance 
and care as may be possible. In the first 
dressing the bearers utilize the bandage- 
packets with which every soldier is furnished 
— carried by the cavalry and train troops in 
the upper right-hand blouse pocket, and by 
all other troops in the left-hand trousers 
pocket — each packet containing, wrapped in 
a piece of vellum, a piece of iodized muslin, 
three to four grammes of cotton, a compress 
bandage, and a piece of waterproof. — As the 
cavalry, artillery and technical troops have 
no bearers, the duties of the latter are per- 
formed by sanitary-soldiers. As a rule, one 
collecting-station is established for every in- 
fantry brigade, about iooo paces in the rear 
of the centre of the fighting line; there the 
wounded receive only such assistance as may 
be necessary for their removal to the dress- 
ing-station. The dressing-station is estab- 
lished from 3000 to 5000 paces in the rear of 
the centre of the fighting line of the division, 
in or near large buildings or in tents. Here 
the wounded of the division are collected 
and receive their first surgical treatment, 
after which they are either carried in the 
ambulance wagons to the ambulance hos- 
pital, or removed at once to the field hos- 
pitals in the next line, or if possible directly 
to the permanent hospitals. To avoid un- 
necessary and repeated examinations, the 
wounded are provided with diagnosis cards, 
attached to a blouse or great-coat button, 
giving nature of wound, treatment received, 
and condition for transportation. If the dis- 
tance to the next sanitary establishment,

itals are mobile establish- 
ments, transported by wagon, one being al- 
lowed for every division of infantry. They 
follow the movements of the Army, and are 
only established when needed, being located 
if possible in large buildings as far to the 
front as possible, from 10,000 to 15,000 paces 
in the rear of the fighting line. To render 
these hospitals able to follow the marching 
columns, necessary measures are taken to 
evacuate them as soon as possible, by send- 
ing the wounded to the permanent hospitals 
in the rear. The transportation of the 
wounded from the field hospitals to the rear 
is effected by means of ambulance or other 
wagons fitted up for the special purpose; by 
rail, on the sanitary trains, for severe cases; 
by temporary sanitary trains, for light cases; 
by water, in the ship-ambulances. "Halting- 
stations" {Kranken-haltstationeri) are estab- 
lished at suitable points on the lines of com- 
munication, for the purpose of giving a short 
rest to men journeying to the rear, and pro- 
viding them with medical relief, refresh- 
ments, etc. 

For the reception of the wounded incapa- 
ble of transportation, stationary or reserve 
hospitals are established in place of mobile 
sanitary establishments. Light cases and 
convalescents are placed in the field infirm- 
aries established on the theatre of war. The 
sick and wounded sent home are distributed 
among the military sanitary establishments 
existing in time of peace, the reserve hospitals 
newly established beyond the theatre of war, 
and finally the hospitals and convalescent 
establishments organized by private societies 
and individuals. The distribution of the 
wounded is regulated by the Minister of 
War. A volunteer sanitary service, already 
organized in time of peace, co-operates ex- 
tensively with the military service in war. 

The uniform and equipment of the bearer 
detachments are the same as those of the 



corps to which they belong, their 
sole distinguishing mark being I black and 
yellow band worn above the left elbow. The 
non-commissione&lt;: v their rifles; 

the privates wear a sapper's sword, 
a pouch tilled with bandages and a large 
canteen of water \- SOOD as they have 
performed their work on the battle-field, 
they return to their respective organizations. 
The company bearer belongs to the com- 
batant class and is not neutralized. 

The flags employed to designate the field 
sanitary establishments, the arm-bands worn 
by the sanitary personnel, and the sanitary 
wagons, all bear the Geneva cross. The 
flags are placed alongside of the national 
colors (black and yellow). 

When the Army is mobilized, a Divisional 
Sanitary Establishment is organized for every 
division, the purposes of which are to render 
first surgical treatment to the wounded, and 
to transport them from the relieving- to the 
bandaging-stations, and from there to the 
next line of sanitary establishments. The 
sanitary establishments of the forty-eight in- 
fantry divisions and eight cavalry divisions 
are numbered consecutively with their respec- 
tive divisions: for example, "Infantry Divi- 
sional Sanitary Establishment No. 36;" " Cav- 
alry Divisional Sanitary Establishment No. 
4." These establishments are directly sub- 
ordinate to their respective division com- 
manders, and are under the supervision of 
the division chief medical officers. 

Every Infantry Divisional Sanitary Estab- 
lishment is equipped for forming two reliev- 
ing (collecting) stations, one bandaging 
(dressing) station, one ambulance (field hos* 
pital), one sanitary-material reserve. Each 
has a staff of medical officers, and a field 
sanitary division. During and after batti&lt; 
until the establishment is evacuated, the 
regimental medical officers of the division 
are also on duty with it. The surgical dut 
at the stations are performed by the regi- 
mental medical officers, under the supervision 
of the division chief medical officer, who 
generally is stationed at the central point — 
the dressing-station. As a rule, the senior 
medical officer and the next two in rank of 
each infantry regiment are designated for 
attendance at the dressing-stations, and the 
remaining regimental medical officers at the

collecting-stations. To each divisional estab- 
lishment is also assigned a field sanitary col- 
umn of the " Teutonic Order." The horses of 
the ambulance and other government wagons 
are furnished by the First Zug of the train 
squadron attached to the division. The main- 
tenance of military order and discipline in the 
establishment, and its economical adminis- 
tration, are in charge of the commandant of 
the field sanitary division. 

The ambulance (hospital) either cooperates 
directly with the dressing-station, or serves 
as a connecting link between the latter and 
the sanitary establishments in rear. When 
the troops remain in cantonment for a con- 
siderable period, the ambulance (hospital) 
may be employed as an infirmary, by order 
of the division commander. The sanitary- 
material reserve contains a supply of medi- 
cines and dressings for replenishing the stores 
which have been expended at the collecting- 
and dressing-stations; the stores of the sani- 
tary-material reserve are replaced by the 
clothing and sanitary-material field depots. 
The field sanitary column is generally at- 
tached to the divisional ambulance (hospital). 
The sanitary-soldiers of the column are fur- 
nished by the field sanitary division; the 
train soldiers and government horses, by the 
train squadron. The divisional sanitary es- 
tablishments of the ist, 8th and 18th Infantry 
Divisions are organized especially for moun- 
tain warfare. The infantry divisional sani- 
tary establishment usually marches at the 
head of the baggage-train of the division, in 
the normal order of march. 

The collecting- and dressing-station divi- 
sion and wagons, under command of the 
commandant of the field sanitary division, 
belong to the fighting train; but the ambu- 
lance and sanitary-material reserves and 
wagons, under command of the second offi- 
cer of the field sanitary division of the Teu- 
tonic Order, are with the baggage train. At 
a halt, or in camp, the infantry divisional 
sanitary establishment is employed as a 
collecting-point for the sick and wounded 
who are designated to be sent to a hospital; 
men unable to travel are placed, by order of 
the medical officers, in the wagons of the es- 
tablishment, and upon arriving in camp are, 
if recovered, sent back to their regiments, or, 
when their number is too great to admit of 



all being put in the wagons of the establish- 
ment, the least exhausted are relieved of 
their arms and accoutrements, which are 
placed in the wagons, and they are left in 
charge of sanitary-soldiers detailed for this 
purpose. The medical officers of the estab- 
lishment always remain with the hospital 
wagons during the march; and four mounted 
staff cavalry orderlies are attached to every 
establishment during battle, to establish com- 
munication quickly between the dressing- 
stations and the ambulance (hospital), and 
the collecting-stations and troops, and to 
carry orders, etc. 

The collecting-stations are placed at a 
shorter distance from the fighting line in a 
covered or hilly country than in an open 
country; the mean distance being iooo paces, 
because this is as far as the bearers are able 
to carry the wounded rapidly without having 
to stop to rest. Each collecting-station is 
placed as near as possible to the line of re- 
treat of its brigade, so as not to interfere 
with the advance of the troops who have not 
yet come under fire, and must if practicable 
be upon a wagon-road connecting with the 
dressing-station. Buildings, hollow ground, 
trees, etc., which afford protection against 
direct fire and the glaring light of the sun, 
with water, straw, wood, etc., in the neighbor- 
hood, are the points recommended for estab- 
lishing the collecting-stations, but as these 
advantages are seldom found combined, it is 
demanded that existing facilities be utilized 
to the best advantage. Each station is 
marked by day by two flags, one with a red 
cross on a white field, and the other contain- 
ing a horizontal black and yellow stripe; at 
night by a white lantern with a red cross. 

The dressing-station is established near 
the line of retreat of the division, and 3000 
paces is its minimum distance from the fight- 
ing line, under the most favorable circum- 
stances. When possible it is located in a 
building or shed, the essentials being ample 
wood, water, and straw in its vicinity, an 
easy exit, wagon communications, etc.; it is 
marked similarly to the collecting-stations. 
When located in the open, the hospital and field 
sanitary column tents are pitched for its use. 

The hospitals are generally located in the 
orders for the disposition of troops issued by 
the chief of staff of the division on the eve of

battle, otherwise by the tli vision chief medi- 
cal officer. 

The ambulance (hospital) is combined 
with the dressing-Station when the field hos- 
pitals are so near the battle-field that the 

wounded can be sent directly to them, or 
when the dressing-station is established on a 
railway or river and it is possible to transport 
the wounded directly to a distant reserve or 
distributing hospital. 

An infantry divisional sanitary establish- 
ment is composed of: Medical officers — 
chief and two assistants; sanitary division — 
two officers and seventy-five men; train di- 
vision — wagons, horses and drivers from the 
train troops, the latter commanded by a com- 
mandant — a sergeant-major; field sanitary 
column of the Teutonic Order (from the sani- 
tary troops one corporal and twelve men, from 
the train troops one corporal, twelve men and 
twenty-three horses), and four ambulance 
wagons and one sanitary wagon packed with 
sanitary material* belonging to the Order; 
four mounted cavalry orderlies, during battle. 
— The total strength of an infantry divisional 
sanitary establishment is three medical offi- 
cers, two sanitary officers, 158 men, 113 
horses, and twenty-five wagons. 

The distribution of the personnel, horses 
and wagons among the subdivisions of an 
infantry divisional establishment, is as fol- 
lows: At collecting-stations — six to eight regi- 
mental medical officers (only during battle), 
one non-commissioned officer and seventeen 
men of the sanitary division; one non- 
commissioned officer, eighteen men, one 
riding and sixteen draft horses, and four 
ambulance wagons of the train troops — 
the non-commissioned officer of the sanitary 
division is commandant of the relieving sta- 
tion division. At dressing-stations — nine to 
thirteen regimental medical officers (only 
during battle); commandant and thirty-nine 
men of the sanitary division; two non-com- 
missioned officers, sixteen men, twenty-three 
horses, and five wagons (including two hos- 
pital wagons of the train troops). — For the 
transportation of the wounded to the rear 
from the dressing-station are also employed 



*Note the clothing, equipments, and arms of 
the men, besides the entire train and sanitary 
stores, are also provided and replenished by the 
Teutonic Order. 



the empty wagons returning from the battle- 
field, requisition wagons, etc. Three medical 
officers, one officer and thirty-three men from 
the sanitary troops, twenty-three men, forty 
horses and eight wagons from the train 
troops, at each ambulance (hospital), includ- 
ing field sanitary column of the Teutonic 
Order. One sanitary officer, four train sol- 
diers, eight draft horses, two four-horse san- 
itary-material wagons, to constitute each 
sanitary military reserve. 

Every Cavalry Divisional Sanitary Estab- 
lishment is equipped for forming one col- 
lecting- and one dressing - station. These 
stations are generally combined. The sur- 
gical treatment of the wounded is performed 
by the regimental medical officers of the 
cavalry, as the establishment is not provided 
with a medical staff. The cavalry sanitary 
division not only furnishes the attendants 
and nurses, but also provides bearers for the 
regiments; its strength is one sergeant-major 
and seventeen men. The wagons, horses and 
drivers of the cavalry train divisions are pro- 
vided by the train troops. There are also 
one sergeant, twelve men, twenty- three horses, 
six wagons, including four four-horse ambu- 
lance wagons for the transportation of the 
wounded from the relieving- to the bandaging- 
station. — The wounded are conveyed to the 
hospitals in rear by means of hired wagons. 
The total strength of each cavalry divisional 
sanitary establishment is thirty-one men, 
twenty-three horses, and six wagons. 

On the march, in camp and cantonment, 
the duties of this establishment are similar 
to those of the infantry divisional sanitary 
establishment; and the position of the col- 
lecting- and dressing-stations is generally 
designated by the division chief of staff. 

In the Field Hospitals the wounded re- 
ceive their first thorough medical treatment. 
Forty are established by the Army, and two 
by the volunteer sanitary service, on mobili- 
zation, at the rate of one per infantry divi- 
sion. They are not specially attached to 
particular army corps, but are directly sub- 
ordinate to the chief of staff, who assigns 
them, as necessary, and the corps in turn 
place them at the disposal of the divisions of 
infantry. 

Every field hospital can accommodate 600 
patients, and is divided into three sections,

each complete in itself and capable of hold- 
ing 200 wounded men. Every hospital is 
furnished with a suitable number of medical 
officers, chaplains, accountant officers, apoth- 
ecaries, and a field sanitary division and dis- 
pensary. The sanitary material, bedding, 
clothing, etc., are carried in government 
wagons especially arranged for that purpose, 
and horsed by hired teams. A transport 
column of the Red Cross Society is assigned 
each hospital for the transportation of the 
wounded to the rear. The personnel of the 
field hospital comprises one chief and nine 
regimental medical officers, one military 
chaplain, three accountant officers, three 
apothecaries, one armorer (to take charge of 
the arms and accoutrements of the wounded) ; 
in its field sanitary division one field officer 
as commandant, two captains or lieutenants, 
177 men; from the train troops, two black- 
smiths and four four-horse teams (for the 
transportation of the hospitals), five two-horse 
wagons (for the transportation of the officers 
and officials), 112 hired horses (for the 
wagons), and fifty-six civilian drivers under 
charge of mounted civilian foremen; the 
transport column of the Red Cross Society — 
consisting of fifteen two-horse ambulance 
wagons and one four-horse wagon containing 
sanitary stores furnished by the volunteer 
sanitary service, the horses being hired, — a 
sanitary division, consisting of twenty-four 
Landwehr or Landstrum men, under the com- 
mand of a non-active officer, forms the per- 
sonnel of this column. The total strength of 
a field hospital, including transport column, 
amounts to twenty-one officers, 276 men, 149 
horses, and forty-five wagons. 

The Field Infirmaries are established at 
suitable points on the theatre of war, or on 
immediately adjoining territory, for the re- 
ception of light cases, convalescents, and 
broken-down soldiers in need of temporary 
rest, and to avoid the necessity of sending 
them to more distant sanitary establishments; 
their number and extent are regulated in ac- 
cordance with the temporary necessities of 
the service, but there must be at least one 
field infirmary for each army corps, with ac- 
commodations for not less than 500 patients. 
Each infirmary has one medical and one 
sanitary officer, two men of the sanitary 
troops, and a number of horses and attend- 



ants furnished by the Jitapen troops on those 
lines of communication upon which the regu- 
lar traffic between the Army and the interior 
takes place. 

At the theatre of war, reserve hospitals are 
established, intended to support or replace 
the field hospitals, in order to permit the 
latter to be pushed again as rapidly as pos- 
sible in advance for the immediate reception 
of the sick and wounded sent from the field 
and field hospitals, and for the temporary 
reception of the sick and wounded sent to 
the collecting-point for transportation to the 
rear. Their number and capacity are regu- 
lated in accordance with the requirements of 
the service, but there must be at least one 
reserve hospital for 200 patients for every 
division. Their personnel and material are 
furnished from the reserves, under the orders 
of the Chief of Intendence; and field apothe- 
caries and the means of transportation are 
furnished when needed. They are numbered 
consecutively, and are subordinate to the 
Chief of Intendence of the Army. A. reserve 
hospital for 200 patients has one medical 
officer, one chaplain, and one apothecary, 
besides one officer and seventy- eight men of 
the sanitary troops. 

Exterior to the theatre of war, reserve hos- 
pitals are also established in the interior; for 
which purpose the localities and arrange- 
ments of the troop hospitals and infirmaries 
may also be employed. They are organized 
after the manner of the garrison hospitals, 
and are classified as field sanitary establish- 
ments and named after their respective sta- 
tions, as, for example: "Reserve Hospital at 
Zuain." 

Stations or Halting-Places for the Sick 
and Wounded are established at intervals on 
those lines of communication (Etapen lines) 
upon which the transportation of the sick 
and wounded takes place, and are for the 
purpose of giving a short rest to men pro- 
ceeding to the rear, and of providing them 
with medical assistance. There are two 
classes of these— those where men passing 
through receive refreshment and attendance, 
but with no sleeping accommodations; and 
those with sleeping accommodations and 
furnishing regular medical treatment. — The 
former are established at railway stations 
where long stops take place. The comfort

of the wounded is attended to by the I 
service, and medical treatment by civilian 
lans. who are established at the rail- 
Stations from which trains are despatched, 

and at all on the road at which the 

transportation must stop over night. The 
••&gt;if I and material of the halting-stations 
are furnished by the Intendence of the Army. 
Two stations, each accommodating 200 men. 
are provided for every army corps; there are 
besides numerous halting-stations which arc- 
established by the volunteer sanitary ser- 
vice. A -crtion for 200 patients has one 
medical officer and one non-commissioned 
officer and six men of the sanitary troops. 
The horses and attendants are furnished by 
the Etapen troops. 

Ambulance Field Sanitary Establishments 
are mobilized in war and divided into "rail- 
way sanitary trains," "improvised sanitary 
trains," and "ship-ambulances;" they are for 
the purpose of transporting the severely 
wounded from the field and reserve hos- 
pitals, and directly from the divisional sani- 
tary establishments, to the permanent hos- 
pitals in the interior of the Empire. Such 
are independent establishments, and have a 
staff of medical officers and apothecaries, 
and a field sanitary division, besides the 
necessary means for the care and refresh- 
ment of the wounded during the journey. 

At least twenty-six railway sanitary trains 
are mobilized by the Army, and six to twelve 
are provided by the "Order of Malta;" every 
train accommodates 104 patients. Also, im- 
provised or temporary sanitary trains are 
formed for the reception of light cases, in 
case the railway sanitary trains are insuffi- 
cient to accommodate them; merchandise 
and passenger wagons, fitted up temporarily 
for the purpose, are used. Each train has a 
medical or combatant officer in charge, its 
sanitary personnel and material being drawn 
from the reserve under the Chief of Intend- 
ence. Refreshments and medical attendance 
are only furnished at stopping-points. 

Under the title of Ship-Ambulances, tow- 
boats are equipped as movable hospitals, in 
case of necessity, for the transportation of 
the wounded on the Danube, Thein, Drau, 
and Save Rivers; each boat can accommo-

A PAGE FROH THE HISTORY OF ANCIENT 
MEDICINE. 

BY I". C. RKMONDINO, M D. 

At the dawn of our civilization the practice 
of medicine was at times about as risky an 
occupation as that of a laborer in a powder 
mill, and the man of science in the early days 
of Greece was apt to fall into hands as little 
considerate of his sensibilities as were the 
aborigines of Oregon toward an unsuccessful 
medicine-man. Royal physicians have not 
always had it all their own way — any more 
than royalty itself. It is well known that the 
physician of Louis XI. often wished himself 
off in some swampy wilderness herding hogs 
or catching edible frogs — especially when 
Louis became a little suspicious as to his 
loyalty and integrity. The court physicians 
of the times of Louis XIV. also had an un- 
comfortable existence — they did not in reality 
enjoy the ordinary peace of mind or of con- 
science, nor the physical happiness, of a 
fourth-rate inn-keeper. Even in our times, 
court physicians do not have such jolly good 
times — at least, so must have thought one 
of the medical attendants upon the late Victor 
Eman uel, who did not propose to be treated 
like an old woman by having his chest en- 
cased in a flaxseed-meal poultice. The King 
was impatient and a little irascible at all 
times, and unmanageable when sick; and 
when, under the restlessness caused by a 
congested lung, he found the doctors indus- 
triously engaged in adjusting a generously 
proportioned poultice to his chest, his war- 
rior spirit rose to the occasion and, grasping 
the poultice, he dropped it with some empha-

sis on the nearest bald-headed medical man. 
Zimmermann found as unreasoning and iras- 
cible a patient in the great Frederick, and 
no doubt the honest and practical old Hano- 
verian physician would have liked to divest 
the King of his royal prerogatives and tumble 
him into some hospital ward where he could 
have treated him in a plebeian and rational 
manner. Old Napoleon was full of hard 
common-sense in these matters; when the 
distinguished accoucheur in attendance on 
the Empress Maria Louisa (overcome by the 
gravity of the case and some dreaded com- 
plications, as well as by the rank of his august 
patient) imparted his fears to the Emperor 
and apologetically suggested that it might 
become necessary to do so-and-so, he was 
much surprised to hear the practical Emperor 
order him to never mind the E?npress, but to 
go at it as if she were the poorest shopwoman 
of the faubourgs, and save the woman. Napo- 
leon knew that in a case of confinement it 
was an accoucheur that was wanted, and not 
a courtier. That was the way Esmarch 
treated the Emperor William when Nobling 
filled his tough old imperial majesty with 
duck-shot; and that was the manner, he 
hinted, that should have governed the treat- 
ment of the lamented Garfield — he should 
have been treated with the same singleness 
of purpose that would have characterized the 
care of a private soldier in an outpost hospi- 
tal. The physicians of the court of Victoria's 
early reign who lost place and reputation by 
honestly standing up for Lady Flora Hast- 
ings also wished that they had never seen a 
court or waited on royalty. 

Herodotus relates that on one occasion the 
great Darius met with an accident from 
which he emerged with a badly sprained and 
very painful ankle. At that period of the 
world's history the physicians educated in 
the old Egyptian temples were much sought 
for by the rulers of Western Asia, and each 
court possessed a number of these physicians 
skilled in the various specialties; and no 
sooner did Darius reach his palace than the 
Egyptian men of science then at the Persian 
court were called to his assistance. What- 
ever great medical learning the old Nile 
temples may have been able to dispense, 
great skill in all the rational treatments of 
sprains does not seem to have been included 



in the curriculum, as King Darius's suffering 
increased and the poor monarch could find 
no rest, to the great perplexity and discour- 
agement of the Egyptians. As the outlook 
became gloomier and the pain more severe, 
Darius began to have fears that he would be 
permanently disabled. At this juncture he 
was informed by some of his household that 
in the prisons there was then confined a 
Greek who was said to know something of 
surgery, as he had held the position of physi- 
cian to Oretes, a former governor or king of 
Samos, whom Darius had dethroned and 
caused to be put to death. This prisoner 
was none other than Democedes, an illus- 
trious Greek physician, but a native of 
Crotona, who, in the confusion and in the 
general collecting-in of the slaves and chat- 
tels of Oretes, had somehow become mixed 
with these latter, and in their company 
brought to Susa along with the rest of the 
plunder. A common slave stood some chance 
of again seeing his country, but good physi- 
cians were so rare and in such demand that 
when a king ran across one he generally ap- 
propriated him and took good care that he 
should not go astray; and the chances for 
any reputable Greek physician ever escaping 
from the Persian court were not very numer- 
ous. Democedes knew this full well, and 
had accordingly disguised his position to the 
best of his ability, so that when brought be- 
fore Darius he in a manner denied his calling 
and profession; but on seeing the execu- 
tioners make ready the implements of torture 
to compel him to own up the truth, out of 
consideration for his anatomy — which he 
very naturally did not wish to see disturbed, 
seeing that nobody but the Egyptians were 
around to patch him up— at the sight of the 
torturers he admitted having some knowl- 
edge of medicine and surgery, at the same 
time expressing his willingness to do, as far 
as his poor skill would permit, all that was 
asked of him. The sprain was then a week 
old, and the swelling and throbbing, with 
excess of pain, had given the King rest 
neither day nor night, and he was then in the 
greatest misery imaginable — even for a 
typical and despotic king. The Egyptian 
physicians, it seems, were more on the natu- 
ral-healer order and not very well versed in 
the other rational treatments of such cases.

plied the warm fomen- 
tations oi the Greeks, which not only relieved 
the King of his great pain so that he fell into 
a much needed sleep, but in a short time re- 
sulted in the restoration oi the ankle to its for- 
mer use. Darius, we are told, was greatly 
delighted with the gentleness and skill of the 
Greek surgeon, and when of a sudden the 
remembrance of the mental and physical tor- 
tures to which the Egyptian physicians had 
subjected him flitted across his mind, instead 
of instituting suits for malpractice in the 
Persian courts, with demands for heavy 
damages — as an American might have done 
— he simply ordered the whole Egyptian 
faculty to be immediately crucified. 

Democedes was none of your narrow- 
minded, vain, egotistical, jealous practition- 
ers; neither was he a great stickler for the 
code of ethics in vogue at the lime, which 
would have prevented him from taking any 
notice of the degraded and about-to-be- 
crucified Egyptians — who were just then be- 
ginning to think that extracting the fuses 
from unexploded bombs was a far less risky 
occupation than that of practicing surgery 
and medicine on the person of a royal despot. 
Finding that Darius was well disposed and 
willing to grant him any reasonable request, 
Democedes generously asked and obtained 
the pardon of the disconsolate Egyptians. 
History does not relate what became of these 
unlucky men, but very likely they were con- 
signed to some obscure position in the royal 
kitchens, to manipulate the kettles and 
masser the saucepans to their hearts' con- 
tent. 

Professor Osier, of Baltimore, is quoted as 
saying that without a good store of analyti- 
cal common sense, the time spent in acquir- 
ing a merely technical education is spent in 
vain. A study of medical biography, ancient 
or modern, lends support to this view. The 
noted Greek physicians who flourished some 
500 years before the beginning of our era 
were men remarkable for the uprightness of 
their moral principles as well as for their 



esty and their breadth of view, original 
•s of observation and research., 
common sense. We cannot help admiring in 
them the utter absence of all " Marnumism,"' 
hypocrisy, and love of the fictitious and mis- 
leading. Well said Sir John Lubbock, that 
in the pagan philosophy of the ancients there 
resided more Christianity than in all our 
modern theologies. Only imagine the trav- 
esty, were the figure and countenance of 
America's great medical reprobate to replace 
that of Hippocrates in the picture of "Hip 
pocrates Spurning the Wealth of Asia," when 
the grand old sage refused all the wealth and 
honors offered by the Persian ambassadors 
to induce him to leave bleak and poverty- 
stricken Greece for a residence amid the 
splendors of the Asiatic court. The spirit of 
Hippocrates has lived in an Agnew or in a 
Gross, even in our own times; but too many 
follow in the deceptive footsteps of the great 
reprobate, too psychologically degenerate 
and morally warped to realize the truth that 

"Corruption wins not more than honesty." 

and too pachydermatous ever to feel the kill- 
ing frost that sooner or later overtakes the 
overselfish and the unscrupulous. 

Democedes was offered all that a sensual, 
sordid and selfish or vain man could appreci- 
ate or desire, in the shape of wealth, posses- 
sions, and honors, would he but remain volun- 
tarily at the court of Darius; he was not, 
however, either by inclination, cultivation, or 
temperament, a Chicago alderman or a Tam- 
many sub-chief; nor was he a prototype of 
the Fifth avenue dude, or of the modern 
European "noble" in search of a wealthy 
American wife. As some celebrities of our 
late Woman's Congress would say, he felt 
that he had a " mission " on earth to perform, 
or a " sphere in life to fill," as well as a proge- 
ny to father, and the Persian environment 
was a bar to his high purposes. He there- 
fore made up his mind to get away at the 
earliest opportunity. Some accounts tell us 
that he cured the Queen Atossa, the daughter 
of Cyrus and wife of Darius, of an ulcer of 
the breast. Through the favor of the Queen 
he obtained from the King the command of 
a Persian naval expedition intended for the 
exploration of the Greek and Italian coasts; 
but no sooner had the ship touched at Taren-

turn than Democedes, eluding the vigilance 
of his Persian companions or guards, forsook 
the command of the ship and proceeded to 
his native town, Crotona, where he married 
the daughter of Milo, the renowned athlete 
and wrestler. Darius's officers attempted the 
abduction of Democedes, whom they seized 
in the forum of Crotona, but the citizens ral- 
lied to his assistance and beat the Persians 
off with their clubs.

CONTRIBUTION TO /ETIOLOGY OF HEDIA= 
STINAL TUflORS. 

BY DOCTOR FRANZ KARNIK. 

The tumors localized in the mediastinum, 
owing to their rarity, seldom come under 
clinical observation. Of the pathological 
benign formations, the hypertrophic thymus 
develops de norma up to the second year of 
life, atrophying after the fifth year, and 
rapidly disappearing during the period of 
puberty, when it is replaced by fatty tissue; 
and for the diagnosis of a hyperplastic thy- 
mus growth, the microscopical disclosure of 
Hassal's corpuscles is a reliable guide. One 
must, further, enumerate among benign me- 
diastinal tumors, lipomas, fibromas, dermoid 
cysts, teratomas, and hyperplastic lymph- 
glands — but these may here, as well as in 
other places, develop malignancy, and of this 
class is the case described by Virchow, of a 
large teratoma obtained from the cadaver of 
a man twenty-two years of age, in which were 
present carcinomatous and sarcomatous ele- 
ments, besides a large number of embryonal 
striated muscle-fibres. 

Malignant mediastinal tumors in individ- 
uals of earlier age are usually sarcomata, 
more rarely carcinomata. Mediastinal tumors, 
according to Feldmann, occur in men three 
times as frequently as in women, and are 
rarely encountered in either at an advanced 
age. Eichhorst found among thirty-five, 
Riegel among forty-one, and Thomayer 
among forty-six cases, but one case of more 
than sixty years. Riegel, moreover, asserts 
these tumors occur chiefly between the ages 
of twenty and thirty, which is corroborated 
by Thomayer; of the patients of the latter, 
eighteen were between twenty and thirty 



years of age, eight between thirty and forty, 
and five between fifty and sixty. All agree 
that the anterior mediastinum is, as a rule, 
the seat of malignant tumor, though Glu- 
zihki and Impaccianti and others describe 
some few exceptions. 

Great difficulties are associated with the 
diagnosis of mediastinal tumors, for they 
may be simulated by neoplasms of the lung 
or pleura on the one hand, while on the other 
mediastinal tumors do sometimes invade 
these organs; a malignant pulmonary tumor 
can only be accurately diagnosed when the 
microscope shows its elements in the sputum. 
Again, the diagnosis of a sarcomatous or car- 
cinomatous pleuritis is rendered possible by 
establishing the presence of tumor-particles 
in the aspirated mass. It may happen casu- 
ally, as reported by Unverricht, that the diag- 
nosis is assured by the proliferation of the 
tumor from the point of puncture after punc- 
ture of the thorax; and it is by no means un- 
usual for the neoplasm to proliferate and 
penetrate the thoracic wall so it can be felt 
under the skin. Almost insurmountable diag- 
nostic difficulties become heaped one upon 
another when a comprehensive pleuritic exu- 
date disguises the physical signs of the tumor. 
Clinically, a tumor is to be classified as me- 
diastinal only when it appears as such ana- 
tomically. 

In view of the difficulty attending differ- 
entiation, and the rarity of these tumors at an 
advanced age, it may be pertinent to report a 
case — the third of its kind that was correctly 
diagnosed during life: 

A man 69 years of age, supposedly suffer- 
ing from pleuritic exudate, was brought to 
the Hofrath Eiselt Clinic November 29th, 
1894. He had never before complained of 
any ailment, and this trouble dated only 
from the end of the previous August; it be- 
gan with difficult breathing — no other symp- 
toms. During the first three weeks he was 
able to walk; then, on his physician's advice, 
he took to bed and was treated with diuretics. 
The dyspnoea, however, constantly persisted. 
Before coming to the Clinic, appetite was 
always good, stools and micturition normal, 
and noapparent elevation of temperature. He 
was of slender build, and ill-nourished. Skin 
dry and pale; mucous membranes blanched; 
temporal arteries prominent and tortuous; 
pupils, equally large, reacted promptly; neck 
short, without special abnormalities; thorax

Rattened, the two halves participating une- 
qually in respiration — the right being more 

elevated than the left, — and intercostal spaces 

of the right side drawn in strikingly during 
ration; supra- and infra-clavicular fur- 
rows ill-defined; breathing superficial, accel- 
erated (44), labored; heart-beat invisible. At 
the level of the ensiform cartilage, circum- 
ference of the chest was eighty-two h 
forty-two being that of the left half; at the 
nipples eighty-three inches, that of 
left half forty-one and one-half. The distance 
of the nipples from the clavicle and from the 
median line was the same on both sides. 
Abdomen drawn in, elastic; no enlargement 
of lymphatics, and no cedema of legs. Pulse 
132; temperature 96 . Daily secretion of 
urine about two pints, without pathological 
constituents. Appetite good; stool normal; 
no expectoration. Psychic depression. For- 
ward to the right, the percussion sound over 
lung full and clear; diaphragm at the level 
of the seventh rib; to the right, back, per- 
cussion sounds all full and clear. Respira- 
tion sharply vesicular. Heart-tones faintly 
audible; flapping on the right edge of the 
sternum at the level of the fourth rib. On 
the left side as far as the third rib the sound 
was subdued, then completely suppressed as 
far as the eighth rib; at the left, back, very 
short as far as the fourth dorsal vertebra, 
then duller. Fremitus absent; considerable 
resonance on percussion. Respiration • for- 
ward, as far as the third rib, scarcely audi- 
ble; backward, to the fourth dorsal vertebra, 
bronchial; in the deeper parts, absolutely 
suppressed. The edge of liver for two 
finger-widths was apparent under the costal 
arch. 

A month later, aspiration yielded a trifle 
more than three pints of serous, yellowish, 
moderately turbid liquid. On examination 
the day following operation, heart sound 
was somewhat shorter in front, on left side, 
as far as the fourth rib, in transverse direc- 
tion, the subdued sound extending back to 
the median line; at the back and as far as 
the middle of the scapula the sound was 
somewhat fuller, then shortened as far as the 
angle of the scapula; perfectly hollow in the 
lower parts. Respiration forward, as far as 
the fourth rib, weaker; at the back, as far as 
the middle of the scapula, vesicular; at the 
apex of the scapular angle, bronchial; then 
extinguished. Frequency of respiration, 40; 
pulse 112; temperature normal. 

The case was decided to be one of media- 
stinal tumor, with malignant exudative pleu- 
ritis. Death occurred suddenly two months 
after his appearance at the Clinic, and the 



autopsy revealed malignant tumor of the 
astinum with infiltration of the adjoin- 
ing lymphatic glands of the substernal 
nective tissue on the left side, and of the 
hilus of the left lung along the bronchi ami 
s; serous plctiritis, with infiltration of 
both tal compression of the left lung; 

right-sided pleuritis after infiltration of the 
interlobular pulmonary tissue. Also there 
were multiple metastases of the liver; 

- of the intestines and stomach; moderate 
induration of the abdominal organs; general 
atrophy. The right half of thorax arched 
forward. The diaphragm of the right side 
was on a level with the sixth rib; of the left 
side, even with the eighth rib. The left 
pleura contained a quantity of yellowish 
viscid liquid, and its walls were thickened by 
fibrous, flat, whitish-gray, soft, lumpy infiltra- 
tions, particularly in the axillary line and in 
the neighborhood of the vertebral column. 
The left lung was compressed, its apex and 
the internal edge adhering to the pericar- 
dium; the anterior edge merged gradually 
into the tumor mass; the visceral lobe was 
thickened, and anteriorly at the edge was 
covered with superficial infiltrations; inter- 
lobar furrow free at the back, obliterated in 
front. The pulmonary tissue was moderately 
oedematous, on cross-section presenting a 
slate-gray color; in the upper and lower 
lobes the bronchi were cylindrically enlarged, 
and at the hilus the tumor mass proliferated 
along the bronchi into the pulmonary tissue. 
The tumor mass was of soft consistence, of 
gray-reddish color, rather sharply outlined. 
The heart was small and relaxed, coronary 
arteries serpentine, right ventricle dilated, 
valves tender; the left ventricle was un- 
equally enlarged, and the semi-lunar valves 
moderately thickened. The aorta was ather- 
omatous, in places softened into a pap-like 
mass and covered with thrombi. The peri- 
cardium adhered to the outer surface of the 
left lung. The superior vena cava was en- 
larged, and at the point of division appeared 
a wall-like thrombus of the right subclavian 
vein — in fact, this vein was completely 
blocked by masses of thrombi. The peri- 
esophageal and peri-tracheal tissues in the 
two lower thirds were infiltrated with the 
neoplasm; indeed the greater part of the 
tumor rested on the bifurcation of the wind-

pipe. The tumor merged, without definite 
outlines, into the peri-glandular infiltrations. 

Returning now to the diagnosis: In inter- 
preting a case, we examine one organ after 
the other, and, when the whole tableau is be- 
fore us, compare it with familiar pathological 
conditions, and our conclusion is influenced 
by the histories of previous cases. For this 
reason great interest attaches to the expe- 
riences published by Curschmann and Besan- 
con. The former reports an anterior media- 
stinal carcinoma occurring in a man 41 years 
of age. The pains radiating from the ster- 
num to the vertebral column constituted the 
first evidence of the disease. Later on, pare- 
sis of the vocal cord developed, which was 
ascribed by Curschmann to pressure on the 
left recurrent nerve. The brachial plexus be- 
ing compressed by a carcinomatous infiltrated 
gland, was the cause of radiating neuralgic 
pains and twitchings in the upper member, 
culminating finally in complete paresis of the 
extremity. On the anterior lower surface of 
the neck and upper parts of the thorax a 
dense venous net was observed, conditioned 
by the fully expanded veins under the clavi- 
cle and in the arm. This is explained by 
engorgement in the upper vena cava, which 
also inducea notable swelling in the face and 
in the region of the thyroid gland. Diagno- 
sis was verified by section, and the tumor 
proceeded from the interior surface of the 
upper and triangular portion of the sternum. 

Besancon observed a mediastinal carci- 
noma in a woman 78 years old, in whom the 
tumor perforated the right bronchus and 
developed in the upper parts of the anterior 
mediastinum. The mediastinal lymphatic 
glands were greatly enlarged; the phrenic 
and recurrent nerves remained intact; the 
right pleural sac contained more than two 
pints of haemorrhagic exudate, and the walls 
were flecked with lentil-sized nodules. In 
the parietal lobe there were pneumonic infil- 
trations in a state of hepatization. 

An instructive case of right-sided pleuritis 
complicated with mediastinal tumor is de- 
scribed by Leube, the great peculiarity of 
which lay in the fact that by percussion one 
could follow the growth of the neoplasm, and 
that the tumor finally proliferated out of the 
thoracic cavity into the fossa jugularis, be- 
coming thus appreciable to the touch. The 



patient was 22 years old, suffered from dysp- 
noea, palpitation of the heart, and later on 
from dysphagia and aphonia. The upper 
part of the sternum arched forward in a very 
striking manner, and the superficial veins of 
the upper right breast were not only greatly 
enlarged but very prominent. Cyanosis and 
oedema of the right face and right hand 
also developed. Prior to death a stenotic 
bronchial murmur became audible at the 
level of the third intercostal space. At the 
autopsy it became evident these symptoms 
arose from the development of an enormous 
mediastinal sarcoma, chiefly on the right side, 
with compression of the trachea. The right 
innominate vein was entirely compressed by 
the neoplasm, the right lung largely so. 

Litten succeeded in diagnosing mediastinal 
tumor during life in a man 22 years of age, in 
whom there developed, in addition to very 
distinct cyanosis, oedema, dilatation of veins, 
etc. — ascribable to contraction of the upper 
vena cava — a haemorrhagic diathesis. At the 
point where puncture of the thorax was per- 
formed for the purpose of aspirating the 
pleuritic exudate, suggillations or ecchymo- 
ses developed; and the blood also assumed a 
leukaemic character. At the autopsy a large, 
small-celled sarcoma was found. 

All the cases cited were tumors of the an- 
terior mediastinum. Hammer, however, pub- 
lishes a case of tumor proceeding from the 
posterior mediastinum in a man 49 years 
old, supposed to be suffering from stenosis 
of the right bronchus. Autopsy revealed, at 
the level of the first dorsal vertebra, in the 
posterior mediastinum, a tumor the size of 
one's fist, proliferating forward and perforat- 
ing the posterior tracheal wall at the level of 
the bifurcation; the left bronchus was com- 
pressed rather more than the right. The 
neoplasm was readily separated from the 
vertebra, and cross-section revealed a num- 
ber of nodules as large as a hazelnut, which 
ultimately proved to be infiltrated lymphatic 
glands. Under the microscope a large-celled 
alveolar sarcoma was revealed. 

I will now endeavor to elucidate the in- 
dividual symptoms observed in the case that 
appeared at the Hofrath Eiselt Clinic. The 
apyrexia which prevailed before and during 
the entire course of the disease dispelled the 
thought of a simple pleuritis, as did likewise 






THE MEDICAL AGE. 



the insidious beginning of the disease and 
the entire pleuritic pains. The 

further fact that under the left clavicle there 

Otable dullness, although the patient 
&gt;ed recumbent for several months, also 
spoke against the supposition of a pleuritis, 
for it stood to reason that the exudate, by 
of gravity, would seek the lowest level. 
The patient nevertheless had the appearance 
of one suffering from very severe disease — 
there was psychic depression, dread of death, 
and finally dyspnoea (evidently caused by 
the proliferation of the neoplasm into the 
pulmonary tissue) that would not abate 
notable fact also was that after paracentesis 
the quantity of urine was materially dimin- 
ished — before this, diuresis fluctuated be- 
tween a trifle over two, and oneand-one-third 
pints, but during the first five days after the 
operation it sank to twenty-two and twelve 
ounces. 

An arching forward on the anterior surface 
of the thorax was not observable, doubtless 
owing to the fact the tumor was not an inte- 
gral growth extending uniformly in all direc- 
tions; on the contrary, it was made up of 
great cohering tumoral masses seated back 
of the sternum and extending in a direction 
opposite to that of the tracheal bifurcation. 
The acceleration of the pulse may be ex- 
plained by the paresis of the cardiac vagus 
fibres. 

Hofrath Eiselt describes a case that pre- 
sented this latter phenomenon: A woman 42 
years old suffered from carcinoma of the 
right lung and right-sided exudative pleu- 
ritis; high fever, dyspnoea, coughing, pains 
in the breast, and acceleration of pulse, were 
conspicuous symptoms. Autopsy showed the 
right vagus was completely imbedded in the 
mediastinal tumoral masses. 

The persisting psychic depression and 
somnolence observable before death, I am 
inclined to refer to the prevailing abnormali- 
ties in the ebbing of the arterial and flowing 
of the venous blood. One of the most strik- 
ing symptoms in the case was the net formed 
on the anterior right surface of the thorax by 
the enormously dilated and interwoven sub- 
cutaneous veins, arising doubtless from a 
constriction of the innominate vein; as a re- 
sult the venous blood was obliged to reach 
the right heart through collateral channels — 



- ami intercostal veins. Indeed, the 
collateral circulation was quite fully 

d, for the oft-cited oedema on the 

neck, face and breast was not observed. 
Neither were the inferior extremities or the 
abdomen cyanotic or "edematous, and the 
autopsy revealed the actual compression of 
the lower vena cava to be so insignificant as 
to nowhere induce more than very moderate 
venostasis of abdominal organs. 

The partial &lt;edema of the right and total 
oedema of the left upper extremity, sugj^ 
thrombosis of the subclavicular veins; the 
venous thrombosis was an important indica- 
tion, since it is a symptom that does not 
occur in inflammatory pleuritis; further, the 
theory of its complication with simple pleu- 
ritis was controverted by the fact that such 
thromboses are uniformly encountered only 
in the lower extremities, in the pelvis, and in 
the pia mater. On the other hand, throm- 
bosis of veins is by no means uncommon in 
the presence of malignant and mediastinal 
tumors; in the descriptions of such there is, 
here and there, mention of thromboses of the 
innominate and subclavian veins, and re- 
cently Oesterreicher described a mediastinal 
carcinoma in which the upper vena cava was 
thrombosed. Venous thrombi have also been 
found with benign tumors, and a case in 
point is that of fibroma of the mediastinum 
with thrombosis of the upper vena cava, de- 
scribed by Pastau. 

The striking cachexia was due to the ma- 
lignant nature of the tumor, and the ad- 
vanced age pointed with tolerable certainty 
to carcinoma. 

It remains for me only to cite a few symp- 
toms which were missing in this case, that 
have £&gt;een observed by others in mediastinal 
tumor. N^laton and Walshe describe a com- 
pression of the innominate artery, enfeebling 
the pulse on the same side. In other cases 
special reference has been made to dyspha- 
gia, the cause for which is to be sought, on 
the one hand, in compression of the oesopha- 
gus, and on the other hand in paresis of the 
vagus; the affection of the vagus has also 
induced vomiting in a number of cases, and 
the attack on the recurrent nerve was mani- 
fested either as glottic spasm (Krishaber) or 
as paresis (Curschmann). 

When the phrenic was attacked by the

neoplasm, hiccough and pains in the region 
of the diaphragm were observed. Rossbach 
described three cases with asymmetry of 
the pupils, in which the sympathetic nerve 
was diseased; and for the latter reason, ex- 
ophthalmos is at times observed. Bennet 
cites one case in which the spinal cord was 
likewise involved. 

With respect to treatment, permanent suc- 
cess can only be expected when the tumors 
are benign. — Rochard describes one case of 
mediastinal fibroma which was permanently 
healed by operation. With malignant tumors, 
the practitioner must be content to treat 
symptoms. 

A diagnosis of mediastinal tumors is sel- 
dom definitely made, — it usually remains an 
open question, — owing to the complex and 
obscure symptoms. Often percussion will ut- 
terly fail to reveal the tumor, and there is 
every chance the malady will be mistaken for 
a form of pleuritis or pleuritic exudate.

SUPPRESSION OF URINE, 

Editor Medical Age: 

In The Medical Age for September ioth 
Doctor Rininger gives an account of a case 
of supposed total suppression of urine which 
lasted forty-eight days, the patient meanwhile 
remaining in perfect health otherwise. It seems 
to me the patient was a fraud, and that re- 
moval from her home and friends, and com- 
mittal to the care of an experienced nurse, 
who would not leave her for an instant either 
night or day on any pretext whatever, would 
have brought about a speedy cure It seemed 
remarkable that she should have succeeded 
in deceiving three successive medical men 
with such a story, and I thought it might be 
worth while to gather together a few facts 
concerning suppression of urine, lest any one 
else be caught napping by a similar patient. 

It is impossible for a person in anything 
like perfect health to have total suppression 
of urine for long, and remain well. The 
symptoms which ensue vary, of course, ac- 
cording to the cause of the suppression, but 
even in hysterical suppression, which seems 
to affect patients less than other kinds, there 



would be vomiting and headache within a 
few days. 

It is impossible for a person with total sup- 
pression of urine from any cause to live for 
forty-eight days. According to Quain's Dic- 
tionary of Medicine: "When suppression is 
absolute, the duration of life appears to vary 
from nine to eleven days." A case is men- 
tioned in Osier's Medicine, page 717, which 
lived eleven days. 

As far as I can gather, total suppression 
of urine only occurs in the following diseases, 
symptoms of one or other of which would be 
found if carefully sought for in any case of 
true suppression: 

Functional suppression may arise from: 
Acute Bright's and the diseases it follows, 
as scarlet fever and diphtheria; cholera, 
hysteria, shock— either a fright, mental emo- 
tion, or after operations on the rectum or 
genito-urinary tracf, spinal injuries, or acute 
intestinal obstruction; cantharides — either 
internally or used as blister or hair-wash; 
turpentine; embolism or obstruction of the 
aorta or renal arteries. 

Obstructive suppression may arise from: 
New-growths of urethra, bladder, or involv- 
ing both ureters or kidneys; calculus. 

Suppression of urine may be feigned. 
Urinary diseases are often feigned, but in- 
continence is more often selected for this 
purpose than suppression, because it is easier 
to carry out. I recall one case in point, how- 
ever, which was told me several years ago by 
a prominent English surgeon. A young 
woman had been sent by her parents to a 
situation that she did not like, and after stay- 
ing there a few days she returned home, com- 
plaining that ever since going away from 
home she had been unable to make any 
water. A doctor was of course sent for, and 
on his arrival he found the bladder empty 
but everything apparently normal. He went 
twice a day, but the bladder was always 
empty, and the mother said the girl had not 
passed any urine between his visits. Still no 
other symptoms developed, and after a few 
days he began to get suspicious of the pa- 
tient's good faith, and directed that a strict 
watch be kept on her, especially when she 
thought no one was near. This was carried 
out rigidly, with the result that her little 
dodge was discovered — which was to pass 
her water into a large sponge every time she 
got an opportunity, and then squeeze it out 
of the window. Needless to say she made 
an early return to her situation. 

Of course, in the above case there was a 
distinct motive for feigning disease; in other 
cases the only motive is to elicit sympathy 
and get " fussed with "—a motive sufficient,

all sor ind put I 

well as other fH i any amount of 

trouble. 

In the above remarks 1 have chiefly had 
total - 00 ID view, though it must be 

borne in mind that suppression may be total 
or partial, the latter being much the com- 
W'hen anuria really exists, whether 
complete or partial, it is an affection which 
demands prompt treatment, and the more the 
treatment is directed towards making the 
kidneys do their own work instead of de- 
pending much on forced action of the skin 
and bowels, the more successful it is likely 
to be. 

As the affection is only a symptom, the 
treatment in any case must be directed to the 
cause, or the disease which gives rise to it.

SAW PALMETTO IN GONORRHOEA. 

Editor Medical . 

Permit me to call attention to a property 
possessed by Saw Palmetto Compound to 
which I have seen no reference in any publi- 
cation, viz., its remarkable therapeutic pow- 
ers in gonorrhoea. 

In the chronic cases of this malady — those 
which appear to be cured, but are prone to 
recur upon slight indiscretion, such as the 
drinking of spirits, sexual indulgence, etc. — 
and which are a cause of great trouble to the 
practitioner, this preparation promises results 
that are more than satisfactory. In these 
cases the pus discharge is reestablished on 
apparently little provocation, and once fairly 
reestablished is apt to persist indefinitely and 
resist all ordinary remedial efforts. It is 
here that I have found the Saw Palmetto 
Compound most effective, in teaspoonful 
doses every three or four hours. The dis- 
charge is usually arrested in three or four 
days, and if the remedy is continued two or 
three weeks permanent relief appears to re- 
sult. Of course the doses may be gradually 
given at longer intervals. 

In acute gonorrhoea the remedy has a sooth- 
ing effect — an action that is potent as regards 
all mucous membrane of the genito-urinary 
tract. It tends to in great measure relieve 
the burning urethral pain that accrues to 
efforts at emptying the bladder, and likewise 
the feeling of weight and uneasiness which 
obtains to this organ and is also manifested 
in the testicles. It does not, however, con- 
trol the discharge as readily as in the 



chronic form of the m &gt;r in the latter 

during its ug -he injections may be

ining of stricture. Saw Palmetto I

THE 



WOODBRIDQE TREATMENT 
TYPHOID. 



IN 



Editor- Mkdicai. 

Recently, having occasion to treat a num- 
ber of cases of enteric fever, I utilized 
Doctor Woodbridge's formula, and I am 
obliged to acknowledge that this measure 
appears to be abortive when resorted to 
early in the disease. Even after the twelfth 
or fifteenth day, it appears to promise better 
results than any other remedy. 

After employing for a few days I invari- 
ably observe that the bed, bedding, perspira- 
tion, urinary secretion and alvine discharges 
all appear to be saturated more or less with 
the medicament, which goes to evidence it is 
intestinally antiseptic, also that it is intra- 
vascular, pervading the entire system wher- 
ever the blood circulates. — If this is correct, 
it cannot but be of value. 

I must admit, like many others, I was at 
the outset strongly prejudiced against this 
method, and not a little because of Doctor 
Woodbridge's statement that typhoid could 
be aborted — which is contrary to general 
teaching; also on account of the utterance 
credited to him to the effect that any physi- 
cian losing a case of typhoid should be held 
strictly responsible therefor. 

I believe I am the first to use this abortive 
treatment in this neighborhood. The results 
that have thus far accrued compel me to 
believe its value has not been exaggerated. 
Very truly yours,

PATHOLOGY OF CHOLERA. 

The comma bacillus, claims of preventive 
inoculation, etc., have absorbed so much at- 
tention of late years that the real pathology 
of this malady has been practically ignored. 
The Medical Age has before called atten- 
tion to the evidences that the lesion is, proba- 
bly, primarily within the central nervous 
system — a theory also upheld by the late 
Alexander Harkin, of Belfast, Ireland, whose 
successes in the management of this malady, 
based upon this pathology, were little less 
than wonderful. It is of interest now to 
know that Tschistowitsch, who investigated 
cholera in the pathological laboratory of 
Winogradow, has arrived at the same con- 
clusions as Doctor Harkin and The Medical 
Age. The most important of his observa- 
tions, as published in the St. Petersburger 
Medicinische Wochenschrift, are as follows: 

In cases dying in the algid stage — when 
this stage appeared within twenty-five to 
thirty hours of the inception of the disease — 
unmistakable changes were observed in the 
cerebrum. Those that died during the period 
of reaction presented the same changes but 
of a more advanced type — in severe cases 
with well marked typhoid symptoms the 
changes were most marked; the alterations 
being chiefly in the nerve cells, but to some 
extent in the blood-vessels. In the ganglionic 
cells in rapidly fatal cases there were evi- 
dences of oedema manifested through in- 
crease of intercellular spaces and the forma- 
tion of fine vacuoles in the cell bodies. Later 



certain of the nuclei became irregular in out- 
line, indistinct, were not affected by nuclear 
stains, and finally entirely disappeared; at 
the same time the cell substance became 
cloudy, coarsely granular, lost its connection 
with its processes, and became merged either 
into a mass of granules surrounding the 
nucleus or — where the latter had undergone 
changes — the entire cell was transformed into 
a collection of granules. In other cases, 
after the loss of the nucleus, the cells became 
more homogeneous. In the intercellular 
spaces, as well as in the walls and bodies of 
the nerve cells, were found round and oval 
neuroglia and round-cell nuclei. 

The small blood-vessels and capillaries were 
also surcharged; the peri-vascular lymph- 
spaces, slightly enlarged, contained extrav- 
asated blood, granular pigment and yellow 
flakes composed of disintegrated and ad- 
herent blood-corpuscles; also pigment gran- 
ules were found within the vessels. Small 
haemorrhages were frequent in the cerebral 
substance. The cell substance of the larger 
neuroglia, with readily recognizable proto- 
plasm, gave evidence of having undergone 
granular degeneration though their nuclei 
and those of the small neuroglia cells were 
not visibly altered. 

In proportion to the extent and severity of 
the seizure the frontal and post-frontal con- 
volutions exhibited the most marked change^. 

Finally, Tschistowitsch holds it is evident 
that the cerebral changes in cholera, as well 
in the algid stage as in the period of reaction 
and typhoid symptoms, are of the nature of 
an acute degeneration and necrosis, and not 
of a peri-vascular inflammation. 

Now that this pathology has emanated 
from a trans-Atlantic source and need not be 
recognized as the result of the labors of Anglo- 
Saxon authorities, it is probable our Ameri- 
can periodicals will be willing to accord it 
some attention — an attention that was denied 
so long as the theory emanated from British 
and American sources. We would here, 
moreover, again call attention to the fact 
that The Medical Age was the first to pro- 
mulgate this theory on this continent, which 
theory is given at greater length in the work 
on "Cholera and its Protean Aspects" ema- 
nating from the press of Mr. George S. 
Davis.

Upon those into whose hands it 

falls. This 'literature, moreover, has a ten- 

recommend perations, and

which the knife takes precedence over every 

other therapeutic- measure. 

Unless one is behind tin ind knows 

something of the real standing of a writer, 
he is liable to accept much that appears in 
literature as true and the outcome of large 
experience, whereas the " would-be authority" 
is possibly just fledged from his al»ia mater. 
The majority of the deductions found in 
medical essays are open to severe criticism, 
for, with the existing large number of journals 
eager to reap the advertising harvest, it can- 
not be expected editors will scrutinize closely 
where their pockets are in question. 

In the last few years the papers of dog- 
matic character, emanating from the pens of 
those not fairly out of medical swaddling- 
clothes, have far outnumbered the legitimate 
contributions. Men of long and wide ex- 
perience cannot find time to publish three or 
four articles a month in different journals, as 
is done by many in the interests of self- 
notoriety. 

This multiplication of the personality of 
self-seeking scribblers by means of the medi- 
cal journals is a rank injustice to the profes- 
sion; it is likewise an injury to each journal. 
Subscribers have a right to expect from any 
publication that it shall furnish them new 
and original matter -not duplicates and re- 
hashes, padded with weak platitudes, and 
devoid of point or pith. Such procedures 
would not be tolerated in any form of litera- 
ture except medical, and even now, in any 
other country save the United States, would 
tend to the everlasting disgrace of both 
author and editor. 

If medical journals, in their need of origi- 
nal papers, are obliged to rely upon the free 
and callow contributions offered in the in- 
terest of self and undeserved publicity, then 
the sooner these publications suspend the 
better it will be for the moral tone of their 
editors, publishers, subscribers, and for the 
good name of the authors who are silly 



enough to in... • ■ . tends to 

elevate professional character. 

&gt;thet literary question extremely perti- 
nent to the medical profession is tl 
Ownership ot papers read before m&lt; 
societies. It is no uncommon affair for the 
author to send duplicate, triplicate, quadru- 
plicate, and even more copies to as many 
different journals as a measure of self-. 
tisement. This is certainly wrong; if a paper 
is of sufficient value to read before a m&lt; 
society, and is accepted by said society, the 
latter by all means should have the disposal 
thereof. We believe it is perfectly right, 
however, that any author of a paper should 
publish it in one medical journal, since the 
issuance of transactions is usually greatly de- 
layed; but even here the permission of the 
society should be first sought, and in the ma- 
jority of cases would undoubtedly be granted. 

There is just as much reason for honesty 
in medicine as in any other form of litera- 
ture. It is outrageous that medical journals 
are overwhelmed with contributions of most 
mediocre character, many being bald adver- 
tisements of patent or proprietary remedies; 
and when such authors assume the role of 
teachers, the disgrace brought upon a noble 
profession is doubled; and it is authors of 
this class that have pretty nearly driven out 
of literature those whose age and experience, 
medical and literary, entitle their opinions to 
thoughtful consideration. 

It is only within a few days that a medical 
editor made a great hullaballoo because an 
article offered to his journal appeared in 
another; and his pen was scarcely dry before 
he deliberately committed a like breach of 
literary morals by sending a paper to no less 
than five different journals, being actuated no 
doubt by the pecuniary interests he had in 
a proprietary remedy which he sedulously 
puffed. 

Is it not full time the profession purged 
itself of these most dangerous and egotistical 
forms of quackery ?

THE MEDICAL AGE. 



027 



about a year between W. A, Hammond and the 
Columbia Chemical Company took a new turn re- 
cently, when Hammond filed a cross bill. The 
part that Hammond and the Sanitarium Company 
have played in this case is not a very flattering 
one, and the Columbia Chemical Company, besides 
having law on their side, have the sympathy and 
support of the entire community. Hutchinson, of 
the Hammond Sanitarium, was requested by the 
Associated Trade and Industrial Press to make a 
statement in regard to the case, but declined on the 
advice of his attorney. The facts have been gleaned 
from the court records. 

Hammond made a contract with the Health Re- 
storative Company, which was the predecessor of 
the Columbia Chemical Company, and which was 
located at No. 80 South Fifth avenue, New York. 
This company acquired from Thurber, Whyland &amp; 
Co. the ownership of "Restorative Wine of Coca" 
and certain other preparations which at that time 
Thurber, Whyland &amp; Co. had been selling under a 
royalty arrangement with Hammond. When the 
animal extracts were discovered and placed be- 
fore the medical profession, in the spring of 1893, 
the Columbia Chemical Company was organized to 
exploit these remedies. It absorbed the Health 
Restorative Company, giving the stockholders of 
that company share for share for their holding. 
After this was done, the stock book showed that 
Hammond owned $450,000 out of $500,000 of the 
capital stock of the Columbia Chemical Company. 
During the years 1894-95, the control of the com- 
pany passed from Hammond, and by February, 
1895, he had parted with his entire holding of stock 
in the concern for cash. He, however, had com- 
pelled the Columbia Chemical Company to enter 
into a royalty contract with him by which he was 
to receive a certain sum from the sale of each bottle 
of the extract. After Hammond had sold his stock, 
and had delivered a large number of bottles of the 
extract to the Chemical Company, receiving for the 
same his royalty, he attempted to annul his con- 
tract with the Columbia Chemical Company, and 
to sell the animal extracts from his Sanitarium. 
When the court prohibited this and sustained the 
contract as existing between Hammond and the 
Chemical Company, Hammond, through his son- 
in-law, Manfredi Lanzi, a former secretary and 
treasurer of the Columbia Chemical Company, at. 
tempted to sell the extracts under the name of the 
"Animal Extract Company." The court stepped 
in again and restrained this concern from selling 
the extracts and closed up their business, adjudg- 
ing Lanzi guilty of contemptand fining him. There- 
upon Hammond came into court (and, by the way, 
the litigation in this matter has extended over six 
months, during which time the Columbia Chemical 
Company have been victorious at every point) with 
a cross bill, asking that he be relieved of the re- 
straint put upon him by the court, and that his 
contract with the Columbia Chemical Company be 
dissolved. This the court refused to do, and held 
Hammond firmly to his contract. 



This fully vindicates The Medh 
as to the position it has held toward the so- 
called "animal extracts" and the promotor 
thereof. It was a foregone conclusion that 
"truth must out," and that the "Great Re- 
tired" would be hopelessly entangled in the 
web of his own weaving. We now bid fare- 
well to the whole matter, feeling assured that 
this individual is in fair way to reap the 
just reward of his unprofessional deeds. 



EDITORIAL NOTES. 



Amenorrhoea. — 

Doctor Marshall, in the British Medical 
Journal, declares Potassium Permanganate 
acts with certainty in seventy per cent, of 
cases — a statement which we are inclined to 
dispute on the ground of personal experience. 
He administers two hours after eating, and 
obviates all disagreeable effects upon the 
stomach by employing a powder embodying 
one-sixth grain cocaine hydrochlorate, one- 
tenth grain ipecac, one grain cerium oxalate, 
and five grains bismuth subnitrate. 

First, we fail to understand why both bis- 
muth and cerium should enter into the com- 
position, since their effect in this instance 
would be identical; second, it would appear 
as if the cocaine alone would be amply suffi- 
cient — providing it would not be neutralized 
by the permanganate, which is certain to be 
the case. Perhaps suggestion may secure 
the results Doctor Marshall claims, for in 
no other way can they be accounted for 
under such treatment. 

Plain Language Needed. — 

Mr. Angell, the anti-cruelty apostle, in a 
recent issue of Dumb Animals, relates an 
experience he had in a country church: 

In the prayer the clergyman asked the Lord to 
enable us to do our duties not in a perfunctory 
manner. 

In the sermon he spoke of ethics and economics, 
encyclopedic man, speculative orthodoxy, psychology, 
isosceles triangle, unifying force from the great Uni- 
versal Self, elaborate scheme of social organization, 
Antinous and Apollo, complex realism, sociological 
expansion, and the old skeleton of a defunct philosophy { 
etc., etc.

Why Remove the Testicles? — 

Doctor J. T. Jelks says: "In view of the 
fact that in operating for senile cystitis the 
relief obtained comes from the eflfect on the 
nerve, and not from the removal of the testi- 
cles themselves, I favor resection of the nerve 
which lies in the spermatic cord. I believe 
in saving the testicles in every case, if possi- 
ble, for, while they may have ceased to be 
useful, they may still be considered by their 
owner as ornamental." 

♦'False Premises, False Results."— 

Beginning with bacteriology, all the pernicious 
and erroneous teachings which have grown out of 
this great mistake in the law of cause and eflfect 
are based upon dogmatic assertion. The distorted 
and valueless experiments made upon animals 
cannot weigh in the balance scale as against the 
utter absence of clinical cures. — Medical Brief. 

Is it not time " faddism " and the medical 
errors thereby engendered were done away 
with? 

Anent Typhoid.— 

One of our India exchanges claims that 
typhoid fever cases in the Orient are being 
successfully treated with chloroform and 
carbolic acid internally. 

Is This True?— 

The Hahnemannian Monthly emphatically 
declares that "the law of similars is the only 
essential part of homoeopathy." 

Suggestive Criticism.— 

A late author and critic classifies modern 
novels as the "erotic, necrotic, and dam- 
rotic." 



Items and News 



I lie Price of ProfeMkHyd Honor.— 

American medical and pharmaceutical 
journals throw caution and ordinary business 
sense to the winds when it comes to recom- 
mending and puffing drugs and preparations 
bearing a foreign name ami recommended by 
gn authority. The success of one or 
German products of synthesis opened 
the doors for a Hood of tines, tines, ols and 
other "antis" that come covered with patents 
of names, of processes of manufacture, of in- 
gredients, of modes of dispensing, of pack- 
age, of label — in short, of everything that a 
patent can be made to cover. They are 
patent medicines in the very widest and 
strictest sense of the word; and yet they are 
received with enthusiastic welcome by press 
and practitioner, are given gratis and gladly 
advertisements that money could not pur- 
chase for a home product though ten times 
more valuable and not one-tenth so much 
patented. 

One of the proprietors of a drug of this 
sort, recently established in America, on 
being approached by the advertising solicitor 
of an American medical journal, answered 
very curtly "they didrit haie to advertise their 
article. They got all the advertising they wanted 
for nothing, in the shape of laudatory communi- 
cations in the reading matter of the medical 
journals" — which was true, every word of 
it, and that too in spite of the fact that 
it was a patent medicine. The very jour- 
nal for which the agent was soliciting, and in 
the very copy which he carried as a specimen, 
contained no less than six laudatory notices of 
the drug in question — one of them a communica- 
tion covering several pages and heralding its 
virtues in almost every known form of disease. 

It is not true that these patents are so 
valuable that the profession must have them 
and must use them, secret nostrums though 
they be. — National Druggist.

[Even more ! There is not one that is not 
inferior to one or more agents that have long 
been and still are common to the materi 
medica; the tempting promises held out b 
their proprietors are based entirely on the 
most superficial observations of irrespon- 
sible people — observations that at best are I 
hired and paid for, with no option toward 
negations. The most vulgar of English and 
American patents adduce equally valuable 
evidence, but not perhaps at the price of the 
virtue of so many professional people, who

by attain a short cut to reputation and popu- 
larity. — Ed.] 

A Valuable Tooth=Paste.— 

No doubt our sailors need all the attention 
paid to their teeth which is possible, and 
here is an advertisement in Japanese-English 
which was widely circulated in English ships: 

In the East there was no good sanitary tooth 
paste was sure to cure and safe to use, so our com- 
pany resolved to prepare a good natured paste and 
successed. The efficiencies of this paste are as 
following: 

Firstly, to strengthen and preserve the nature 
of the tooth: Secondly, to tight the tooth with 
thingams: Thirdly, to defend a hemorhage arisen 
by frictrir: Fourthly, to take away the offensive 
smell of the mouth: " Fifthly, to difent the putri- 
faction of tooth and so prevent the carious one. 
Any one who uses this paste will certainly discover 
that it is of a very wonderful and valuable nature, 
by his practice. 

To use this paste, it is necessary to vinse the 
mouth will walir aftr sabling the tooth carefully 
by the tooth brash. 

A good-natured paste which has successed 
ought certainly to tight the tooth with 
thingams, if not with thingambobs, and to 
prevent the carious one; but how is it, how- 
ever good-natured, to defend a haemorrhage, 
however arisen ? And how is the tooth sabled ? 
Oh, mysteries of English as she is wrote! — 
British Journal of Dental Science. 

Bromidrosis.— 

According to Tragon, Louis XIV. suffered 
from foetid feet to such a degree that the 
worst courtesans in Paris fainted away there- 
from in his presence. Henry IV. had the 
same redolent perfume, but this did not pre- 
vent the diplomatic Queen Marguerite from 
occupying the same couch; and she pardoned 
her liege lord's legendary infidelity as well as 
the loud odor of his royal toes. One day he 
was so redolent that Madame de Verneuil, 
one of his court favorites, said to him: " Sire, 
it is fortunate you are a king; without that 
your presence would not be tolerated — you 
stink worse than carrion." 

The German soldiery are notorious for 
bromidrosis, and are obliged by law to use a 
deodorant powder of salicylic acid on their 
odorous and tyrannical feet. — Medical Re- 
corder. 

Leaden Forceps.— 

In a very interesting communication by 
Doctor Luigi Sambon to the British Medical- 
Journal an account is given of the ancient 
custom of making offerings to the gods. 
Many of these donaria were thrown into the 



water at some hot or mineral spring in which 
the patients bathed or from which they 
drank. In the temples of healing gods were 
gathered surgical instruments, pharmaceu- 
tical appliances, or images of various parts 
of the human frame shaped in metal, stone, 
and terra cotta. Amongst the surgical in- 
struments offered by patients and surgeons 
as a thanksgiving, a quaint one is described 
which will doubtless appeal to the conser- 
vative dental surgeon. It is recorded that 
Erostratus offered to Apollo, in the temple 
of Delphos, a forceps of lead to show how 
little he approved of the extraction of teeth 
which were not loose enough to be pulled out 
by the fingers. — British Journal of Dental 
Science. 

Big Words.— 

There used to be a clergyman in the old 
town of Newbury, Mass., somewhere back in 
the last century, who was famous for his big 
words. On one occasion he was invited to 
preach at Harvard College. In those days 
they used to have two sermons a day. The 
students listened to him in the morning, took 
in all the hard words and quotations, and 
put their heads together. In the afternoon 
they appeared in the chapel, each with the 
largest dictionary he could command, and 
when the preacher used the first word out of 
the common course there was such a rustling 
of leaves that the reverend gentleman looked 
up in alarm. He was bright as well as eru- 
dite, however, and, seeing the point, translated 
his words as he went along. — Our Animal 
Friends. 

Therapeutic Failures. — 

The serum treatment of pneumonia has 
proved disappointing, and it is generally ad- 
mitted that abortive measures for this disease 
are failures; tonics are still the mainstay. 
Of tuberculosis it is hardly necessary to say 
that most practitioners prefer to rely upon 
climate and hygiene rather than upon tuber- 
culin or any of its modifications. Regarding 
health resorts, medical men should not ad- 
vise a residence where the patient cannot 
find means of subsistence, no matter how 
promising the change of climate. Constant 
protests come from health resorts against 
the sending of consumptives without means 
to places where they either can make no 
living at all or must work so hard for mere 
subsistence that they break down under the 
strain. — Southwestern Lancet. 

An Unselfish Offer.— 

Doctor E. A. Woolsey, of California, says 
it is useless to establish quarantines or take

Unjustifiable Experimentation.— 

Von Bergman, during a clinic, pressed upon 
a spina bifida, to demonstrate that slowed 
pulse, asphyxia and coma are caused by 
driving the cerebro spinal fluid in the tumor 
upwards in the central canal, through the 
opening m the pia mater at the floor of the 
fourth ventricle and into the sub arachnoidean 
space. The asphyxia was so complete that 
the child could not be revived, and death en- 
sued. — Berlin Correspondent of the Indiana 
Medical Journal* 

A Nail in the Skull for Thirty Years.— 

For thirty-two years Francis Mellon, who 
recently died in a Blackwell's Island hospital, 
managed to exist with a lath-nail driven 
through the crown of his head. He suffered 
no apparent inconvenience, and had it not 
been for the autopsy no one would have 
known of the presence of the nail. The 
skull, with the nail driven through the thick 
bone, is now among the hospital's collection 
of curiosities. — Medical Review. 

Vaccination.— 

The opponents of this most beneficial 
measure have only to enter Italy and witness 
the frequent outbursts of smallpox, and its 
ravages amongst the rural population, to be 
taught a lesson of its value. Blindness from 
smallpox, almost totally stamped out in Eng- 
land, finds frequent victims still in Italy, 
where vaccination is only done sporadically 
amongst the country people. — Journal of 
Medicine and Science. 

Black Witchcraft.— 

A fearful case is reported from Ireland, 
where a woman was boiled or roasted to 
death under the impression that she was 
"fly" or a witch of vicious predilections. — 
Indian Medical Record. 

Disappointments.— 

The greatest disappointments in progres- 
sive medicine within the last decade have 
originated in Germany and France. — Medi-

In the October issue the late Professor 
George J. Romanes, "upon whose shoulders 
the mantle of Darwin fell," considers the 
question whether natural selection has been 
the sole or but the chief cause of the progres-

but laid chief stress on natural selection, will 
eventually prove the most accurate of all.

The History of Prostitution. By William W. 
Sanger, M.D. Cloth; 8vo; pp. 709. Price, $4.00. 
The American Medical Press, New York. 

The first edition of this work appeared 
nearly half a century agone, and, though it 
attracted widespread attention in certain cir- 
cles, in the main it was discouraged and con- 
demned, and its author vilified, which doubt- 
less accounts for the fact no subsequent 
editions were issued until the present. It is 
not only a complete review, historically and 
otherwise, of prostitution, but deals with the 
causes that lead thereto, and the means es- 
sential for its regulation — for, it cannot be 
denied, attempts at suppression ever have, 
and ever will be, futile. 

Of all the arguments that have been ad- 
vanced regarding the causes that lead to this 
evil, none have recognized its keystone. Even 
in modern society the "one law for the man 
and another for the woman" has done more 
to uphold the vice than anything else which 
is attached to our sociology. Inhumanity 
and illiberality are to-day, as they ever have 
been, the chief cause of depravity and misery 
in woman; and to this may be added the idea 
especially engrafted upon young American 
women that it is their duty to appear socially 
what they are not, and that the most impecu- 
nious shall vie with her sister of the brown- 
stone front. Indeed, it is notorious that many 
mercantile establishments tacitly favor clan- 
destine prostitution by encouraging young 
women to enter their employ at such meagre 
incomes that an honest life is practically im- 
possible. 

Doctor Sanger's work is one of the most 
important contributions to sociological litera- 
ture. It should be perused by every student 
of social science, and has the special merit 



Nervous Diseases. By American Authors. Edited 
by F. X. Dercum. Cloth; 8vo; pp. 1052. Price, 
$6.00. Philadelphia: Lea Brothers &amp; Co. 

This is the latest publication dealing with 
nervous maladies, and Doctor Dercum has 
had the assistance of no less than twenty col- 
laborators of first rank in the profession — 
notably N. E. Brill, C. W. Burr, Charles L. 
Dana, Landon C. Gray, W. W. Keen, P. C. 
Knapp, S. Weir Mitchell, William Osier, and 
James C. Wilson. It is manifestly the pur- 
pose of this volume to simplify the subject 
and remove those difficulties which have 
hitherto hedged about all forms of nervous 
maladies. Beginning with the very founda- 
tion — anatomical and physiological — of ner- 
vous science, it proceeds to aetiology and 
general management. Thus it is adapted not 
alone to the needs of the practitioner, but as 
well to the student. The illustrations are 
especially commendable both as to original 
character and number; there are 341 engrav- 
ings and seven colored plates. 

As a whole the work is a representative 
American volume, alike in the theme and the 
manner in which it is handled, the authors 
and the educational institutions which they 
honor, and the form in which the informa- 
tion is presented. 



Cutaneous Medicine. By Louis A. Duhring. 
Cloth; 8vo; pp. 221. Price, $2.50. J. B. Lippin- 
cott Co., Philadelphia. 

This is Part 1 of a systematic treatise on 
diseases of the skin by this well known 
author. It is the beginning of a series that 
will supplement this author's earlier works, 
and will replace his "Practical Treatise on 
Diseases of the Skin," which for several years 
has been out of print. It deals with the 
anatomy and physiology of the skin, general 
symptomatology, aetiology and pathology, 
general diagnosis, treatment and prognosis, 
and is exceedingly well illustrated. The ma- 
terial embodied on all sides has been ap- 
proached from a practical standpoint and is 
the result largely of personal clinical obser- 
vation, and researches in skin anatomy and 
pathology. The principles of therapeutics, 
moreover, are laid down upon the more con- 
servative lines of modern research and ex- 
perience, yet the remarkable changes in 
pathological views that have accrued to 
dermatology during the last decade are fully- 
presented.

Therapeutic Brevities. 



at rei cut writers state 
that typhoid fever is always the result of 

drinking contaminated water. While this 

may he a cause, it is not the only one. I 

baveofteo seen the dis through fami 

■ ere they used as pure water as ever ran 
out of the hills and mountains — where there 
was no contaminating matter whatever. 

1 have treated typhoid fever for twenty 
or more, and often could not find any 
cause for the disease, except an accumulation 
of trash under the houses, which houses were 
on the soil or very near the ground. I noticed 
that typhoid fever always started from old 
houses where the filth or trash had been in a 
state of decomposition for years. This zy- 
motic poison may originate from decomposing 
vegetable or animal matter. 

This specific virus has a direct affinity for 
the spleen and bowels, especially for the 
lower part of the ileum and upper part of the 
colon. This poison produces a necrotic in- 
flammation and infiltration of the follicular 
structures and adjacent parts, called " Peyer's 
patches." And there may be catarrhal in- 
flammation of the rest of the mucous surface. 
Not only is there diarrhoea as a result of this 
poison, but typhomania, stupor, etc. 

The treatment by cold water and turpen- 
tine emulsion failed to cut short the disease, 
— it may have saved some lives by modify- 
ing the virulence of the malady, but it was 
far short of being successful: for while cold 
water, externally and internally, is pleasant to 
the patient, it does not antidote the poison. 

The sulpho-carbolate of zinc and the sul- 
pho-carbolate of soda have proved to be the 
most efficient remedies yet tested. The£a/&gt;- 
tisia tinctoria — wild indigo — has proved very 
active as an anti-zymotic. I have treated 
several cases (well marked typhoid fever) re- 
cently with the baptisia and sulpho carbolate 
of zinc, alternated. I give fifteen to thirty 
drops of the tincture of baptisia four times a 
day, and five to six grains of the sulpho- 
carbolate of zinc between times. 

I have the body washed with a warm solu- 
tion of chlorate of potash, once or twice a 
day in winter, and a cold solution in summer. 
The diet should be fluid, and, where the pa- 
tient refuses milk, chicken essence or soup 
may be given. Predigested food is a good 
diet for the patient. Try this treatment, and 
you will succeed in aborting this tedious 
disease. 

Some cases, if seen at the outset, may be 
checked the seventh day. I know the pro- 
fession are not prepared to receive this state- 



ment, hut I ask a fair trial on the part of all, 
and especially of the incredulous. 

If diarrhi n, 1 restrain it with com- 

pound syrup of rhubarb. If haemorrhaj 
in, I use two grains of Mon sell's salt every 
i hours. 

For typhomania, I have found three or 
four minima of belladonna, once or twice a 
'lay, sufficient to counteract this condition. 
And if this fails to produce sleep, a dose of 
codeine may be given at night to promote 
rest, sleep, and quiet. 

Now I write this to save life and to prevent 
long suffering of typhoid patients. Under 
the old treatment I have often seen them lie 
forty and sixty days, and sometimes die at last. 
I hope the profession will try this treatment.

Fistula in Ano. — In anal fistula it is con- 
ceded that if the faeces could be taken away 
by a large catheter in the rectum, the main 
trouble would be easily remedied. Few of 
us but have witnessed the healing of large 
urinary fistulae, by having the bladder emp- 
tied often and so effectively as not to allow 
the urine to pass into the false opening. 

Reasoning by analogy, I advise that the 
bowels be kept gently open by compound 
liquorice powder, a teaspoonful every night, 
thus imitating the action of the catheter. I 
also enjoin that, at each stool, the patient 
throw into the bowel some tepid water in 
which a little soap is dissolved, and that when 
the sitting is completed the end of the bowel 
should be well washed with the same fluid. 
The faeces are, by this means, carried quickly 
and easily through the gut, and there is the 
nearest thing to a safeguard against the foul 
discharge entering the internal opening of 
the fistula, or lying in a decomposing state 
so close to it as to prevent healing. 

My results have been marvellous. I have 
never seen a case with an internal opening, 
excepting two of recto-vesical fistula:, in which 
this procedure was not satisfactory. In cases 
with considerable false membrane lining the 
fistula, I pass into the bottom of the tract 
a lint shred, dipped in acetum cantharidis, to 
be drawn out when the itching set up becomes 
very severe, which answers most admirably. 
I have no doubt as to the utility of the rectum- 
cleansing treatment, in every case, and I am 
sanguine that with gentle stimulation to the 
bowel, and the judicious application in some 
cases of acetum cantharidis, the barbarous, 
painful, comparatively dangerous, and on the 
whole unsuccessful treatment by the knife 
will, if not altogether abandoned, be rele- 
gated to those rare cases which will serve to

of past rectal surgery. — Doctor Tucker, in 
Massachusetts Medical Journal. 



Diet in Typhoid Fever. — The thermometer 
is of incomparable use as a guide to feeding 
typhoid-fever patients. The time to push 
food is during the intervals when the tem- 
perature is lowest, since at that time digestion 
and assimilation are most active and food 
does most good; when temperature is highest 
these functions are much in abeyance. I find 
it best not to crowd food, yet often when the 
heart and respiration are weakest during high- 
temperature periods a vast deal of good can 
be accomplished by giving the patient rich 
beef-essence diluted with an infusion of green 
or black tea of best quality. This sort of 
food, which serves an excellent purpose during 
these periods of great depression, is stimulant 
to the ganglionic nerve-centres; the cold bath, 
too, has here a wonderfully benign influence, 
backed up with proper food. 

A soft-boiled egg is a valuable food, relished 
by many fever patients at certain times. — 
Put a fresh egg in a large tea- cup, pour full 
of boiling water, let stand covered from four 
to six minutes, when both yolk and white 
will be sufficiently cooked; season to taste, 
and add a little onion- juice to liven the 
flavor. Some patients will take the whole at 
a meal, others only a part. 

Bake a ripe apple, and feed the soft pulp. 
This is an admirable change, besides being 
easily digested and a good philippic to the 
stomach. 

Pap is made by rubbing up to a smooth 
paste two or three tablespoonfuls of first- 
class flour in water to the consistency of 
cream. Pour this into a mixture of equal 
parts of boiling milk and water; stir and cook 
slowly for half an hour. This has high pro- 
teid and carbon values, serving an excellent 
part as food, used also as a diluent of bouillon 
;and essence. In the meantime be sure the 
patient is made to drink sufficient water dur- 
ing the day and night — do not wait till it is 
: called for, but force it on him if necessary; 
| even half a wineglassful often repeated is 
* certainly good for him. — Joseph Adolphus, 
in Chicago Medical Times. 



Rational Treatment of Epilepsy. — I have 
given a vast amount of thought and study to 
this disease, and have come to conclusions 
which are new and somewhat startling, but 
nevertheless incontrovertible. I employ atro- 
pine sulphate, one grain, and one drachm of 
a one-per-cent. solution of nitro-glycerin in a 



half-ounce of 96-percent, alcohol, giving 
from three to five drops of the combination 
in water three times daily, three hours after 
meals. 

The dose may be increased, with caution, 
but only as the physician directs. In some 
cases it has been gradually increased to ten 
and twelve drops, due heed being given to 
its physiological effects in every instance. 
Each drop of the solution contains j} )(J grain 
of atropine sulphate, and one-fifth drop of 
the one-per-cent. solution of nitro-glycerin. 

An epileptic attack has two distinct phases: 
a sudden anaemia of the brain produced by 
some unknown cause; followed quickly by 
an intense congestion with its concomitant 
symptoms such as convulsions, etc. There 
is no doubt that vaso- motor spasm causes 
the cerebral anaemia; but what is the cause 
of the spasm and the subsequent dilation, 
has so far eluded all research. Yet the 
propriety of using an antispasmodic for the 
first phase (and an arterial stimulant in the 
second) to relieve the spasmodic anaemia of 
the brain, is unquestionable; this is most 
readily effected by my combination of drugs, 
which by its continued action prevents, or at 
least hinders, the frequent recurrence of the 
symptoms, hence wards off subsequent con- 
gestions as well. — Doctor Timmerman, in 
Alkaloidal Clinic. 



Sodium Salicylate in Rheumatism. — Three 
principles should never be forgotten: No 
prescription in large doses at the commence- 
ment of a polyarticular rheumatism: The 
division of the doses: The continuation of 
the remedy after the relief of pain. 

At the outset the dose should be ninety, 
sometimes even one hundred and twenty 
grains. The average dose of ninety grains 
should be maintained for about two days, 
then diminishing fifteen grains each day until 
sixty grains is reached. These large doses 
are necessary because the drug is useful the 
more acute and recent the disease is, and 
because early treatment certainly prevents 
cardiac complications. Divided doses are 
advisable because of the rapid elimination of 
the drug; in this way only can the effect be 
made more lasting and complete. For this 
purpose direct fifteen grains to be taken 
every two or three hours; further, it should 
be prescribed for at least twelve days after 
the pain has been relieved. It should be dis- 
solved in a definite quantity of liquid— an 
alkaline water; being a local irritant, it 
should never be administered in concen- 
trated solution. In case of pregnancy it 
should be administered cautiously in divided

doses. The albuminuria of rheumatic origin 
is not a contra-indication to the use of this 
drug, but when it - the rheumatism, 

and especially when it is due to a renal lesion 
which impairs the permeability of the kid- 
neys, the Sodium salicylate is contra-indi- 
. though the dangers of its use have 
been exaggerated. — Journal des Practidens. 



&gt;ral Poisoning. — What- 
ever facts or theories there may be regarding 
the modus operandi of the hypnotic and anaes- 
thetic action of chloral, there can be no doubt 
about its chemical composition and affinities, 
and, in particular, that it is almost at once 
decomposed, at and above 6o° F., outside the 
body, by an alcoholic solution of KHO, and 
somewhat less quickly by an aqueous solution 
of the alkali. Therefore, assuming that a 
person has swallowed a poisonous dose of 
chloral— say eighty grains, as was done in- 
advertently by the late lamented Professor 
Tyndall — and that there could with safety 
be given as a chemical antidote twenty-seven 
grains of KHO, this amount being the quan- 
tity by weight required to decompose eighty 
grains of chloral, — there are strong a priori 
grounds for assuming that in about fifteen 
minutes the chloral would be entirely changed 
into formate of potassium and chloroform, 
or, at least, that so much of it would be de- 
composed that the residue would be harm- 
less. As a matter of practice I would give, 
in such a case as Professor Tyndall's, 220 
minims of Liquor Potassre — equal to fourteen 
grainsof KHO — highly diluted in warm milk, 
gruel, or barley-water, in two doses, an hour 
apart. If this were given before the patient 
was too far gone, the amount of chloral in 
the system would soon be reduced to a quan- 
tity quite within the tolerance of an adult, 
providing there were no heart trouble. — John- 
Doug all, in Glasgow Medical Journal. 



Syrup of Hydr iodic Acid. — Every physician, 
at one time or another, meets with difficulty 
in the administration of iodine and alkaline 
iodides, probably having even been compelled 
to discontinue these valuable therapeutic 
agents on account of nauseating taste, and 
tendency to provoke gastric and intestinal 
disturbance. ... I now can speak con- 
fidently of the superiority of the Syrup of 
Hydriodic Acid over all other iodides, pos- 
sessing none of their disadvantages, while 
retaining in full their therapeutic value. 
. . . It is superior to potassium iodide, 
since it does not give rise to the digestive 
disturbances; further, it is pleasant to take, 



bling syrup of orange and lemon — two 
•ions by far too often not taken into 
consideration, and that represent a triumph in 
elegant pharmacy. In none of my 
treated by Syrup Acid Hydriodic have there 
been any digestive disturb 1 plain! 

against taking. It is i readily, and 

iodine compounds can be detected in the 
urine ten minutes after ingestion. It is elim- 
inated by all the secretions, chiefly the urine, 
as iodides and iodates. — Do&lt; i"k 1 
Thorn 1 

Professor Reynold W. Wilcox adds thai in 
this drug is had 4, a palatable and efficient 
mode of administering iodine. The dosage 
is under control; it is possible to saturate the 
patient with iodine, yet iodism can be avoided. 
The field of usefulness is greater than that of 
iodide of potash or any other alkaline iodide."

Poisoning by Male fern. — Doctor Alkie- 
wicz, of Pobiedzisk, details a very instructive 
instance of severe toxic effects produced byf] 
the internal administration for tapeworm of I 
a rather liberal dose of ethereal extract of 
Male-fern. The patient, an otherwise quite j 
healthy woman, who, on a former occasion, 
had been given 150 grains of the remedy I 
without any bad consequences, took this I 
time, at 8 a m., 300 grains of the extract, dis-m 
solved in tincture of cinnamon. During the I 
day she had several fairly profuse stools, and | 
about 6 p.m. she suddenly fell into a deep J: 
and prolonged swoon. When seen she was |&gt; 
in grave collapse, with hardly perceptible |: 
pulse, incessant nausea, retchings, vomiting, I. 
tremor of hands, and general restlessness, fit 
In about two hours, under the influence of Ji 
champagne, ice, and black coffee, the alarm- 
ing symptoms began to gradually subside. | 
The next day she was still weak, and on I 
the third there developed an intense jaundice, I 
which lasted for several days, to disappear,, I 
spontaneously. Doctor Alkiewicz adds that 
the maximal dose of ethereal extract of Male- 
fern for a woman should not exceed 225 
grains, and for a man 260 grains; but we 
should say that such large (and proportion- 
ately expensive) doses are altogether super- 
fluous. — Provincial Medical Journal. 



Pain of Jhtrns. — The immediate relief of 
the pain of burns and scalds is a matter of 
practical importance; constitutional shock is 
thereby lessened and one of the initial dan- 
gers of injuries of that class is avoided. A 
remedy said to have been employed with 
great success at the Charite Hospital, Paris,

is a solution of Picric Acid. That it is alto- 
gether harmless, is a proposition open to 
some question, since picric acid is toxic to 
man as to the lower animals, and given in- 
ternally causes gastric disturbance, rapid 
wasting, and universal straining of tissues, 
without elevation of temperature. Applied 
to a large raw surface resulting from a burn 
or scald, absorption of a dangerous amount 
might readily take place. As every one 
knows, the pain of such injuries may be 
readily controlled by a solution of bicarbo- 
nate of soda, a teaspoonful to the pint of 
water, which often acts like a charm. Also 
a weak solution of carbolic acid is nearly 
or quite as effective and almost instantaneous 
in action. — Medical Press and Circular. 



Citric Acid in Urethritis. — Doctor Perlessier 
employs injections of Citric Acid in one-per- 
cent, solution, and also washes the urethra 
with a solution of eight parts in iooo or 1500 
parts water, throwing from one to two ounces 
directly into the bladder. The urethral in- 
jection is repeated six times daily, and the 
washing is practiced once a day. The patient 
usually is discharged cured about the tenth 
day. — Revue Internationale de Me'decine. 



Soft Chancres. — The pus from soft chancres 
has been found to lose its virulence at 102 F. 
This discovery has been applied practically 
in the treatment of phagedenic soft chancres 
by bathing the part affected for ten minutes 
several times a day with water at a tempera- 
ture of 105 , the results being most satisfac- 
tory. The phagedena subsides and the gen- 
eral health of the patient rapidly improves. —

5 Ammonium carbonate, 24 grains. 
Syrup tolu, 6 drachms. 
French brandy, 3 drachms. 
Syrup senega, 3^ drachms. 
Syrup gum arable, sufficient to make three 
ounces. 

Give a teaspoonful every two hours. 

— Domifiion Medical Monthly. 



Pertussis. — Thymus serpyllum is a specific 
for pertussis, acts in any stage of the disease, 
and is also a nerve sedative and gastric stim- 
ulant. The action is fully established in 
twenty-four hours and completed in five days. 
It is perfectly harmless in doses as large as a 
teaspoonful of the tincture for a child of 
eight years. — S. E. Straley, in American 
Doctor. 



Medical Progress. 



Lesions Produced During Coitus. — 
These are of importance from a medico-legal 
as well as a gynaecological standpoint. The 
hymen may remain intact after coitus, either 
because the male organ has not penetrated 
the vagina, as when the solidity of the hy- 
men or narrowness of the vagina prevents 
intromission, or in cases which present a very 
elastic hymen with a large opening. Usually, 
during the first union this organ is ruptured 
by a single blow, the line of tear being single, 
double, or radiating from the opening; more 
rarely the hymen is torn away at its attached 
margin and remains hanging by one side. In 
violent intercourse, especially when the hy- 
men is annular and thick, the tear may ex- 
tend into the vaginal wall. The hymen is 
not merely a fold of mucous membrane, but 
contains muscular tissue and may be well 
supplied with blood-vessels. As a rule the 
haemorrhage following its rupture is slight 
and soon ceases; if serious, the bleeding ves- 
sels should be tied; if parenchymatous, a 
tampon is effectual. The tear usually heals 
in two or three days, but acute inflammation 
may arise from infection of the wound or too 
frequent coitus. 

Laceration may occur in the region be- 
tween the clitoris and the meatus urinarius, 
or severe haemorrhage may be caused by 
rupture of the turgid blood-vessels of the 
neck of the uterus. Improper formation of 
the hymen, malposition or diminutive size of 
the genital opening, and abnormal position 
or violence during coition, may lead to recto- 
vaginal fistula. 

I believe that vesico-vaginal fistula due to 
coitus is almost an anatomical impossibility 
— even in a short vagina the penis never 
enters entirely when in the natural position. 
A distended bladder might be thought to aid 
in the production of such a fistula, but it 
presses the uterus backward and upward, 
thus lengthening the vagina and stretching 
its anterior arch, and the only possibility is 
the detachment of the anterior fornix from 
the uterus. Lesions of the upper part of the 
vagina do not occur if it is healthy and of 
normal elasticity and extensibility, despite 
the relative size of the male and female 
organs and the violence of intercourse, except 
occasionally when in an unnatural position. 
In one of my two cases the pathological con- 
dition was furnished by atrophy associated 
with the climacteric, in the other by chronic 
atrophic parametritis. 

Intercourse by the urethra occurs only in 
cases of atresia hymenalis, when it is locus

inthism and 11- Dangers.— Driving 

in any part of Paris in the morning about 
half-past eleven o'clock, or in the evening at 
six, 01 i hundreds of French men and 

women seated at the little tables in front of 
the cafe's drinking, and three out of every four 
are si] g isinthe. This distillation of an 
herb that grows in some parts of France and 
Switzerland contains, besides alcohol of 85 
•nt., an essential oil which possesses for 
absiniheurs a fascination. The liquor when 
poured out resembles in color Scotch whiskey, 
but when a perforated silver spade is put 
across the top of the glass with a lump of 
sugar on it, and water allowed to drip slowly 
through, it assumes an opalescent green color 
with a taste of anise seed. It is now ready 
for consumption, which requires from one- 
half to three-quarters of an hour. The absin- 
theur then goes home with an excellent appe- 
tite and lies down at night to voluptuous 
dreams Next morning he awakes quite well, 
and the absinthe of the day before acts as a 
mild aperient. Hut soon the scene changes, 
and in a few years or a few months, as the 
case may be. and as the number of glasses 
a day has been smaller or larger, we see him 
a prey to tremblings, epilepsy, dementia, 
neurasthenia or convulsions, cerebral or spinal 
congestion, paralysis, etc. For this, one, two, 
three, or at most four absinthes a day are 
enough. One of the first actions on the nerve 
centres is to annul all sexual desire, and it is 
from this cause — absinthe — that the popula- 
tion of France is decreasing, while suicide, 
crime, insanity and diseases of the nervous 
system are increasing. Professor Laborde 
injected recently, before his class, twenty 
drops of the essence of absinthe into a guinea- 
pig, which died after a series of epileptiform 
convulsions; during the interval the animal 
stiffened itself on its four legs, curved its 
back in arc dc cercle % and then fell down 
repeatedly, agitating its forepaws wildly and 
crying piteously until death ended its suffer- 
ings in forty five minutes after the injection.

Gall-stones from Tig hi Lacing. — The 

relation of tight lacing to the development of 
gall-stones is rendered very clear by noticing 
the situation of the gall-ducts in the liver 
deformed by tight lacing; the furrow thus 



caused runs directly the right lobe of 

the liver, as the result of which there is a 
tendency to atrophy of the gall-bladder. 
When tight lacing has been practiced to a^ 

extreme degree, an artificial fissure is formed 
in the liver, giving rise to what is termed the 
" lacing lobe," which carries with it the 
bladder. The constricted portion of the liver 
is found to be just at the point of junction of 
the gall-bladder with its duct. In these 

ommon to find the gall bladder greatly 
distended, extending far beyond the border 
of the liver, and frequently an exami: 
made post-mortem reveals the presence of 
gall-stones. Stagnation of the bile i&gt; well 
known to be one of the most important causes 
of the formation of gall-stones. A change 
in the composition of the bile, from catarrh 
resulting from congestion of the mucous mem- 
brane, and the thickening of the bile due to 
failure of the gall-bladder to completely 
evacuate itself, gives rise to the formation of 
small masses which serve as nuclei for calculi; 
hence anything which obstructs the free out- 
tlow of bile through the cystic duct must 
favor formation of gall-stones. I am also of 
the opinion that many cases of cancer of the 
liver should be attributed to tight lacing. It 
is only a few years since Langenbuch was 
obliged to open an abdomen to remove a 
"lacing lobe" of the liver, which had been 
so completely separated from the rest of the 
organ as to cause its death, rendering its re- 
moval necessary. In view of such facts as 
these, it is the duty of every physician to take 
special pains to warn his patients against the 
evil effects of this pernicious practice. Few 
women are conscious of the fact that they 
are injuring themselves by tight lacing. —

A Ne^ Anesthetic, a Suustituti 
Cikare. — Professor Rosendahl, of Upsala, 
describes a new anaesthetic and paralyzant, 
which he imagines can supersede curare in 
the physiological laboratory, and likewise 
prore of some value therapeutically. He 
terms this drug Septentrionaline, inasmuch as 
it is obtained from the aconite of the north, 
Aconituni lycoctonum, which also provides two 
other alkaloids, both strong convulsive 
poisons and antagonistic to the former. 
Septentrionaline is a white or slightly yello^ 
ish powder, of bitter taste, producing after M 
short time an anaesthetic effect upon the 
tongue, soluble in alcohol and ether, and in 
water slightly. Taken by the mouth it in- 
duces no general poisonous effects, but sub-

tion and sometimes induces nausea. It 
paralyzes first the sensory nerve-endings, and 
later there is sometimes a short motor irrita- 
bility, followed by paralysis of the muscles; 
the result is that the animal is made first an- 
aesthetic, then is quite paralyzed and motion- 
less. If the dose is very large, the muscles 
of respiration also become affected and 
breathing ceases, though the heart still con- 
tinues — the heart is thus always the ultimu?n 
moriens. If artificial respiration is employed, 
the animal can be kept alive indefinitely, and 
recovers as soon as the poison is eliminated. 
In spite of its poisoning, the heart muscle 
does not appear notably affected. The in- 
fluence on the pupil is slight or altogether 
nil. In vivisections it is preferable to curare, 
because the dosage is fixed, and it produces 
anaesthesia. So far as its possible use in 
practical medicine is concerned, strychnine- 
tetanus, both in frogs and warm-blooded ani- 
mals, yields immediately to injections. The 
dose required to produce paralysis or curar- 
ization is, per kilogramme of body-weight, 
for dogs .007 gramme, for cats .01 gramme. 
The dose for human beings must be calcu- 
lated on this basis. — Medical Record. 



FlLARIA LOA BENEATH THE CONJUNCTIVA. 

— Eight months before coming under obser- 
vation, this woman, 32 years old, felt Filaria 
loa in one eye. The worm caused a sensa- 
tion of pricking or quivering, and its move- 
ments were clearly recognizable; it wandered 
over the eye beneath the conjunctiva, which 
it raised into a small ridge as it moved; it 
sometimes left one eye, and could be felt to 
cross the bridge of the nose beneath the skin 
and find its way into the other eye; of late it 
had confined itself to the left eye. Some- 
times the eye was tender and a little suffused 
after the appearance of the parasite. In the 
warm climate of Africa the worm made its 
appearance frequently, but on the woman's 
return to England it was only visible in warm 
weather, disappearing into the deeper parts 
on exposure to cold. When the parasite was 
visible the eye appeared normal, except for a 
small vesicle at the outer part of the con- 
junctival cul-de-sac, and tortuous movements 
could, under favorable conditions, be seen 
beneath the conjunctiva. The worm was 
kept in place with a finger, while the eye 
was cocainized. Then an incision was made 
in the conjunctiva and the parasite with- 
drawn. It looked much like a piece of fish- 
ing-gut, and was active for a short time, but 
soon succumbed when placed in a weak solu- 
tion of boric acid. It was twenty-five milli- 



meters long and five-tenths of a millimeter 
thick; the head tapered slightly, and the tail 
to a greater degree. Around the worm was 
wrapped a fine filament that appeared to be 
its alimentary canal. From the size of the 
animal it appeared to be a male. It is not 
known how it gained entrance; no filaria 
were found in the blood.— Argyll Rober i - 
son, before the Ophthalmological Societv of 
Great Britain. 



A Curious Anomaly. — At the Congress 
of Gynaecology, Obstetrics, and Paediatrics, 
at Bordeaux, Lannelongue reported the case 
of a male infant, aged three months, which 
passed water through an umbilical appendix 
resembling a penis, and also by the natural 
organ which was in its proper place,— the jet 
which came from the umbilical canal described 
a curve more than thirty centimeters in di- 
ameter. On examination it was found that 
the apparent abnormal penis was an umbili- 
cal hernia caused by the persistence of the 
urachus. A urinary fistula had been pro- 
duced on the separation of the umbilical 
cord. The child died of broncho-pneumonia; 
and at the post-mortem, the bladder having 
been injected, it was seen that that viscus was 
prolonged by a channel as large as the fore- 
finger—namely, the urachus — up to the um- 
bilicus. This channel extended into the ex- 
ternal appendix, where it opened by an 
oblique orifice resembling the meatus' uri- 
narius. The contractions of the bladder in 
micturition caused a stream in both direc- 
tions, umbilical and urethral, hence the double 
jet of urine seen from time to time; this, 
however, was exceptional, as the musculo- 
elastic ring of the umbilicus fulfilled the 
function of a sphincter and prevented the 
escape of urine through that orifice. This 
experience once more shows the necessity of 
tying the umbilical cord only after having 
satisfied one's self that there is no hernia at 
the proximal end. — La Se?naine Medicate. 



Waterlogging in Anaesthesia. — Doctor 

Joseph Price says that in his own work at 
present shock is simply unknown. What is 
sometimes called shock is simply ''water- 
logging with an anaesthetic." Commenting 
on this, the Denver Medical Times remarks 
that: "Men and women graduate from the 
best medical schools in the country and prac- 
tice surgery, and yet never know how to give 
an anaesthetic. A great deal of fuss is made 
about histology, microscopy, etc., and yet a 
student may attend three years in any one of

The fact is. the op- 
hardly dares offer a on, the

as this condition of affairs continues, there 
will be "waterlogged patients dying from so-

And we add: There will be an immeasura-

innocent and interesting of our fellow-beings, 
merely because the great majority of their 
medical attendants have never learned prac- 
tically how to employ anaesthetics in labor; 
and because this class of patients and this 
alone think it their duty to be martyrized ! — 
New York Medical Times. 



CURIOUS Gastric Concretion. — A man, 
aged 44, who took alcohol too freely, com- 
plained of anorexia, headache, etc.; had a 
coated tongue and slight tremor. His symp- 
toms were attributed to alcoholism, and after 
a month's treatment he was much improved. 
Some months later, however, he died of pulmo- 
nary tuberculosis, and the necropsy revealed 
a deep chronic ulcer of the stomach situated 
close to the pylorus, causing adhesion to 
the liver. With the ulcer was found a calcu- 
lus of flattened cylindrical form, measuring 
ten centimeters in length, five centimeters in 
width, and four centimeters in thickness, 
weighing 75 grammes. It was very dark 
green, of resinous appearance, and showed a 
aminated structure. Chemical examination 
confirmed the view that the concretion was 
of a resinous material, resembling shellac. 
The patient was a joiner, and it was supposed 
he habitually drank some of the alcoholic 
solution of shellac used in his trade, and that 
the shellac had precipitated in the stomach. 
His employer declared the man had habitu- 
ally drunk shellac polish, and that he had 
repeatedly warned him on that account. 

Carl Friedlaender reported a case in which 
there were many shellac stones in the stomach 
and intestines, that gave rise to fatal ileus; 
another, detailed by Langenbuch, had two con- 
cretions (one in the stomach, one in the intes- 
tines). — Berliner Klinische Wochenschrift.

Biliary Cirrhosis in Children. — Seven 
cases presented all the symptoms observed 
in the adult; but, in addition, in many in- 
stances there was hypertrophy of the spleen. 
So marked is the splenic enlargement where 
there is not great enlargement of the liver 
that the true nature of the disease may be 
easily mistaken. We believe this associated 
enlargement of the spleen is peculiar to cases 
of biliary cirrhosis commencing in childhood; 
a further peculiarity is the frequency with 
which clubbing of the fingers may be ob- 
served; in some instances there was enlarge- 
ment of the ends of the femur and tibia.

ELECTROTHERAPEUTICS IN GENERAL 
PRACTICE.* 

BY A. LAPTHORN SMITH, B.A., M.D., M.R.C.S. 
(ENGLAND). 

Notwithstanding the immense strides which 
the application of electricity to the arts and 
sciences in general has made during the last 
ten years, it must be admitted that its em- 
ployment in the general practice of medicine 
and surgery has not become so widespread 
as one would have been led to expect. That 
this mysterious element possesses marvellous 
powers as a therapeutic agent, when properly 
applied, must be evident to every one who 
has attended any of the meetings of this 
Association; while hardly a number of any 
medical journal can be picked up which does 
not contain one or several articles recom- 
mending the application of electricity for 
some particular disease. There are many 
specialists, both inside and outside the limits 
of this Association, who employ electricity 
almost exclusively, and it cannot be denied 
that their results will compare favorably 
with, and even surpass, in many cases, those 
obtained by the use of drugs or the applica- 
tion of the knife. 

If electricity has failed at all to make that 
headway in medicine which is so much to be 
desired, it is principally because the general 
practitioner has failed to take it up. The 
reason for this is probably to be found in 
the difficulties to be contended with in ob- 
taining a suitable apparatus, and in keeping 
it in order when once obtained. The busiest 
man in the whole profession is without doubt 
the general practitioner, who is often a first-

ronto meeting of the American Electro-therapeutic 
Association. 



rate all-round man, attaining to an excellence 
in several departments of his work which is 
hardly excelled by the specialist who does 
nothing else; but he is certainly, as a rule, 
greatly pressed for time, and looks askance 
upon any method of treatment or procedure 
which is likely to make any serious demand 
upon the already limited time at his disposal. 
Also, being obliged to provide himself with 
costly instruments in half a dozen depart- 
ments of his art, the high prices generally 
charged for electrical apparatus have seri- 
ously militated against this method being at 
all generally adopted. If the apparatus were 
placed upon the market at a price somewhat 
approximating its cost, and if the methods 
of applying it could be so simplified as to be 
easily learned, there is no doubt that the 
number of practitioners who would use it 
daily would number thousands, instead of 
hundreds. 

I shall now endeavor, briefly, to show how 
the cost of an outfit and the trouble of keep- 
ing it in order may be reduced to a mini- 
mum. The outfit which is really essential is 
a moderate-sized battery, a galvanometer, 
a current-controller, and electrodes. With 
these alone a vast variety of cases can be 
treated, such as chronic inflammation of the 
joints, fibroid tumors, endometritis, and 
chronically inflamed ovaries. In addition to 
this, a faradic apparatus is required. What 
we want, in order to extend the use of the 
faradic current in medicine, is that some 
manufacturer should make by the thousand, 
and at a very moderate cost, an apparatus 
quite as good as the original one which has 
cost the specialist so much money and time 
to perfect; and it seems to me an important 
part of the duties of this Society to decide, 
through its committee on faradic apparatus, 
upon a standard apparatus which could be 
recommended to the general practitioners 
throughout the country. The faradic coil,

a much longer and thinner apparatus would 
require. Sue': . should be 

manufactured by the hundred, for something 
like $5.00 apiece. 

In near. town and village there is a 

telegraph « 'trice, and the operator is an elec- 
trician in a small way; at least, as a rule, he 
or she know -&gt;ut electricity to set 

up a battery and take care of the cells. The 
operator has generally some spare time, and 
in return for a moderate remuneration would 
be willing to take c:. the doctor's bat- 

tery. A good many physicians, inclined to 
make frequent u ctricity in their prac- 

tice, 'nave told me they became discouraged 
because the apparatus would not work just 
when they wanted it; and I experienced the 
ne difficulty myself until I purchased a 
&gt;mall instrument which looks like a watch, 
and which when applied to the two poles of 
any cell will indicate at once whether that 
particular cell is working well or not. If at 
any time, therefore, my battery gives out, I 
have only to rapidly run over the fifty or 
sixty cells until I come to the dead one, which 
is made evident from the needle not moving 
when appjied to it. In a moment this offend- 
ing cell is taken out of the circuit and laid 
aside. When a half-dozen of them have thus 
been retired from use we can send for our 
friend, the telegraph operator, or some other 
young man who is fond of electricity, who can 
spare an hour in putting them in order. 

We should have a few spare cells also, to 
leave at any house where we have a patient 
undergoing a course of faradic treatment. 
Those, of course, who are being treated by 
the galvanic current must, as a rule, be car- 
ried to our office, but they generally improve 
so much after a few applications that this 



a much less difficult an 
than at first appear - ary.

with the view 
vestm general practitioner, for he 

will in the of a few months 

it in a sufficient variety of 

:eatly 
tation by the good quality 
-k he is thus enabled to perform. A 
person wi ting with the pres 

of an exophthalmic goitre will have, and 
justly so, a very high opinion of the | 
cian who, in two or three applications of the 
continuous current, relieves the difficulty in 
breathing, and who by a dozen applications 
produces a feeling of general well-being 
which remains for a year or longer. I have 
had many such cases. And the patient who 
is suffering from menorrhagia will appreciate 
the haemostatic effect of the positive pole of 
the galvanic current in the uterus. 

But I had better, perhaps, take up the 
various applications of electro-therapeutics 
in general practice, in their proper orde I 
shall begin with the galvanic current. In 
my opinion, by far the most important use of 
it is in fibroid tumors: any general practi- 
tioner who is competent to do aseptic mid- 
wifery is quite competent to treat the average 
fibroid tumor by means of the galvanic cur- 
rent. I shall not take up your time by giving 
directions how this is to be employed; Apos- 
tolus little book, as well as many others, 
contains directions so explicit that a child 
could almost understand. The secret of 
success I have found to be the most rigorous 
cleanliness of the hands and instruments 
whenever they are used in the vagina or 
uterus, and, secondly, on no account to use 
force with a solid instrument. If you cannot 
get the sound into the uterus, see if a bougie 
will go, and then so curve the electrode that 
it will follow the same road. This method 
is only dangerous in the hands of those who 
employ force to introduce the sound.* It 
will cure most cases of subinvolution and 
endometritis, diminishing the periodical haem- 






*I have also found that drawing down the cervix 
with a bullet forceps &lt;&gt;r vulsellum will generally 
straighten the canal so that the sound will enter. 
The expensive platinum sound may be dispensed 
with by using cast-zinc or copper sounds. 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 






orrhage and completely arresting the leucor- 
rhcea. Tender and bound-down ovaries are 
greatly relieved by means of an oval-ball 
electrode, gently pressed against them at the 
vaginal roof. Dysmenorrhcea I have cured 
over and over again, simply by connecting 
the negative wire to a uterine sound, gently 
pressed against the os uteri, for after a few 
minutes it will be found to easily slip in. 
Half a dozen applications a month, for two 
months, has cured a number of my cases, 
some of whom have since borne children, 
although they had been sterile before. I 
believe that in several patients I have re- 
duced abdominal distention from ascites by 
passing the galvanic current through the ab- 
domen, but of this I am not so sure. I have 
also in many cases, by means of the negative 
galvanic current, brought on the menstrual 
flow in stout women with an infantile uterus, 
whose life was a burden to them owing to 
their obesity, and who obtained new pleasure 
in life by losing their surplus fat. 

Next to these uses of the continuous cur- 
rent in gynaecology, I think its greatest value 
is to be found in the treatment of goitre. I 
am perfectly certain that it does produce a 
marked effect upon the vaso-motor nerves of 
the head and neck, for I have many times 
made the patient become pale, and in some 
cases even faint, simply by turning on the 
galvanic current of fifteen or twenty milliam- 
peres, and this without causing the slightest 
pain whatever. I presume the diminution in 
bulk of the spongy vascular thyroid gland is 
due to the same cause as the pallor and 
faintness, namely, the toning up of its dilated 
blood-vessels. 

In persistent congestive headaches the 
galvanic current is very effective, but apply- 
ing it to the head will not cure headaches 
due to blood-poisoning from constipation. 

The value of the continuous current in 
chronic diseases of the joints cannot be over- 
estimated. Several times I have seen an in- 
firm person walk erect, after an application 
of this current (by means of two large moist 
clay electrodes) to each side of the joint for 
from five to ten minutes. 

In all these cases I believe the mistake has 
been made in the past of not using a strong 
enough current, owing to the want of moist 
clay electrodes of sufficient size. With the 



ordinary little sponge electrodes, usually sup- 
plied, not more than two or three milliam- 
peres can be used without burning. 

Another use for the galvanic current from 
which I derived great satisfaction when I was 
in general practice was in the treatment of 
cases of orchitis, after the acute stage was 
over, when the patient was able to walk, but 
while the testicle was still very large and 
tender. A few applications of the galvanic 
current to the testicle has a wonderful effect 
in diminishing both the size and the sensi- 
tiveness of that organ. 

In stricture of the urethra I have also found 
the method of Doctor Newman very satisfac- 
tory, except in two cases — one a gentleman 
who had been cut for stricture many times, 
and had also enlarged prostate and inflamed 
bladder, in whom I was able to keep the canal 
up to No. 28 for several years with a nega- 
tive bougie, but eventually it failed; the other 
a young man who had a long and thick trau- 
matic stricture, from falling on a sharp-edged 
piece of wood, which damaged the urethra 
very greatly. 

With a good faradic apparatus any intelli- 
gent practitioner can accomplish a great deal 
for his patients, both male and female. If 
the apparatus has a long fine coil and a short 
thick one, he can treat a great range of dis- 
eases, using the fine-wire current of tension 
for nervous diseases (especially when they are 
evidenced by pain) and for muscular diseases 
(especially when accompanied with wasting). 
Thus he can relieve the majority of cases of 
ovarian and uterine neuralgia, as well as 
vaginismus,, by applying the fine-wire cur- 
rent, with the bi-polar electrode, in the uterus, 
or merely in the vagina. On this point I can 
speak from a somewhat large personal expe- 
rience; but although I am a specialist, and 
consequently have a great many such cases 
to treat, I have been outdone by one of my 
friends who is a general practitioner, and 
whom I induced to purchase a Gaifte's faradic 
apparatus. One day, happening to go into 
his office, I noticed that his battery bore 
signs of having been very frequently used, and 
I asked him how it came to be so worn; he 
replied that he had cured more of his suffer- 
ing women by this means than by all other 
means put together. I asked him what was 
the nature of their diseases; to which he 






THE MEDICAL AGE. 



answered that he did not know — all he could 
say was that they had complained of pain, 
and he had relieved it, and in most CI 
cured it, by simply applying the fine-v, 
faradic current as high up in the vagina as 
he was able to introduce the electrode. I 
might add, however, that it will be found 
5t useful in women who present what are 
called hysterical symptoms, and who com- 
plain of a pain in the ovaries which is re- 
lieved by pressure. Any case of ovarian 
pain which is relieved by firm deep pres- 
sure over the ovaries, will, I can almost 
promise, be cured by fine-wire faradism. In 
those cases in which the pain is increased by 
pressure, we may relieve, but are not so sure 
to cure, by this treatment. 

The benefits of a fine-wire faradic current 
are not limited to the female sex, for in tes- 
ticular pain of nervous origin, such as men 
suffer from when going through some anxious 
ordeal, five or ten minutes' application of 
fine-wire faradism will give almost instant 
relief. 

Also in headaches, and neuralgias about 
the head, whether supra-orbital, infra-orbital, 
or in the orbit itself, the fine-wire current 
passed through the part will nearly always 
relieve if it does not cure. 

One curious case in which the fine-wire 
current gave great relief was one of hydro- 
salpinx, in which the woman came to me 
regularly, for several years, whenever the 
tube became distended. She refuses to be 
operated on, as she has been relieved of her 
suffering every time by the application of 
the faradic current — followed, strange to say, 
by a profuse watery discharge. The distended 
tube, which was easily felt before the appli- 
cation, could not be felt afterwards. 

I have also had a somewhat similar expe- 
rience in prolapsus uteri; in very advanced 
cases and in very old women it has sometimes 
failed, but in the majority of cases the result 
has been remarkable. In one case the uterus, 
which for years had remained outside the 
body, thenceforward remained inside, owing, 
apparently, to the toning-up effect on the 
muscular tissue of the uterine support, in- 
cluding the vaginal outlet. 

I have also had several gratifying results 
in atony of the female bladder: one lady was 
in the habit of only passing water every three 



by which time the bladder becair- 
tended. By introducing the bi-polar elec 
into the bladder while it was still distended 
with urine, contra re almost immedi- 

ately set up, so that at the end of ten days' 
treatment she went home completely cured, 
:ig water several times a day. 

Another instance of its value in contract- 
ing hollow muscular organs is in atony of the 
uterus after labor. I have had no experience 
of this, for it has always been my routine 
practice to give a teaspoonful of ergot; but 
several of my friends who carry a small far- 
adic battery in their obstetric bag have told 
me that they have promptly arrested post- 
partum haemorrhage by this means. 

I have tried it a few times in chronic con- 
stipation, with good results. 

One very satisfactory case of epigastric 
pain, which seemed to be made worse by 
morphine, was cured at a single seance with 
the fine-wire current. This lady had been in 
great suffering, and I had tried various drugs, 
without avail, when it suddenly occurred to 
me to try the faradic current; placing one 
pole over the painful area in the epigas- 
trium, and the other over the spine, in a few 
minutes the lady stated that the pain was 
quite gone. Neither did it occur subse- 
quently; and ever since being relieved of her 
pain this lady has positively been a trouble 
to me by bringing her friends, no matter 
what they were suffering from, to my office, 
for electricity, which she believes will cure 
anything. I attributed the relief in this case 
to the contraction of the dilated stomach, 
which was thus toned up enough to expel the 
gas which was stretching its fibres and caus- 
ing pain. 

Several other cases to which I look back 
with considerable pleasure, were of ladies 
suffering from a very wearing pain in the 
back, not due to displacement of the uterus 
nor to congestion of the kidneys, but simply 
and the other muscles which hold the spinal 
to weakness of the erector spinae muscles 
column erect. The application of the fine- 
wire faradic current, passed up and down all 
over the back, but especially along the spine, 
gave great relief. This was followed by the 
coarse-wire current with slow interruptions, 
by the aid of which these muscles were 
greatly strengthened. Whatever the modus 



THE MEDICAL AGE.

operandi may have been, one thing is certain, 
and that is that these patients were cured. 

For lumbago, which, as you are aware, is 
often a very intractable disease, I have used 
the fine-wire faradic current quite frequently. 
In a few of the cases the disease has returned 
from time to time; but in quite a number the 
effect has been permanent, the patients having 
remained entirely free from this disease for 
the last five years. 

Although here I cannot speak from ex- 
perience, there is another instance in which 
the coarse-wire current is of inestimable 
value, and that is in cases of paralysis of 
healthy muscles due to disease of the spinal 
cord, from which their nerves originate. 
The muscles are healthy, and so they would 
remain if they could be exercised; but when, 
owing to disease or accident, the current of 
the nerves is either not generated, or if gen- 
erated is not sent down owing to section of 
the nerve cord, we are able by means of the 
faradic current to exercise these muscles and 
keep them in good order until such time as 
the brain or spinal cord, or nerves leading 
from them, shall have recovered their power 
to originate or conduct. 

The galvanic current sometimes becomes 
of very great value in what might be called 
aesthetic work. Thus, a beautiful woman, 
whose beauty is marred by the presence of 
fifty of sixty long black hairs on her face, 
grieves constantly at their presence, and 
would be grateful if we would remove them 
by electrolysis. I have done this several 
times. Then naevi may be destroyed by 
passing through them half a dozen fine 
needles, which are then threaded on to a fine 
copper wire, and the negative current turned 
on to thirty or forty milliamperes, of course 
under an anaesthetic. The result is, the 
naevus disappears without leaving a scar. 
Then again, the man with the paralysis of 
the vaso-motor nerves of the nose, whose 
olfactory organ blooms a fiery red color, can 
have this rubicundity removed by the appli- 
cation of the galvanic current, which tones 
up the dilated vessels. 

The galvano-cautery is, for the general 
practitioner, one of the most useful applica- 
tions of electricity that I know of. By means 
of the judicious use of cocaine and the red- 
hot platinum wire a great many minor opera- 



tions may be done without general anaesthesia 
and without the loss of a drop of blood. 
Large warts may be removed from any part 
of the body, but especially from about the 
genital organs. Small and even quite large 
sebaceous tumors may thus be amputated. 
In the operating-room the diseased tube and 
ovaries may be amputated with the galvano- 
cautery knife, which has the immense advan- 
tage of destroying the infecting virus re- 
maining in the stump, and hence operations 
performed in this way are much less likely to 
be followed by adhesions. It is also useful 
for stopping oozing from torn adhesions; 
and, in fact, if the adhesions met with in 
abdominal surgery were cut across by the 
cautery knife, instead of with cold steel 
knives or scissors, there would be no oozing 
at all. 

If there is anything discouraging in general 
practice it is advanced cancer of the uterus, 
the patient having first come under the prac- 
titioner's notice in a condition of the disease 
so advanced as to render it useless to operate 
with the knife. With the galvano-cautery 
knife we can hook out piece after piece of 
the diseased tissue, without the loss of any 
blood, until nothing is left but the shell of 
comparatively healthy tissue; while if we 
could succeed in removing all the diseased 
tissue, this method has one very great advan- 
tage over removal with the knife, in that the 
heat which converts the dull wire into a cut- 
ting instrument, at the same time destroys 
the bacilli of cancer and prevents a reinfec- 
tion. From the reports of our distinguished 
Fellow, Dr. Byrne, of Brooklyn, the results 
from this method of treating cancer are fully 
as good as those following the treatment by 
total extirpation; and while in advanced cases 
the latter method is simply out of the ques- 
tion, the treatment with the cautery knife 
removes the sloughing tissue and puts a stop 
to the haemorrhage and suppuration which 
wear the patient out by exhaustion or septic 
infection. For further information on this 
point I would refer the reader to Dr. Byrne's 
excellent article in the International System 
of Electro-therapeutics. 

The application of the galvano-cautery 
knife in general practice was out of the ques- 
tion as long as a battery was required to 
produce the current, because the apparatus

electricity in these and many other diseases

attention to the fact that during the last

very much increased while the cost has been 
diminished; so that there is no longer any

able to afford. Of course there are certain 
branches of treatment, such as the use of the

In time of peace the number of medical 
officers for each Infantry regiment, of four 
battalions, is four for the regimenta 
and the battalions, and one for the Ersatz 
(reserve) battalion cadre. The regimental 
medical officers are: Regimental Arzte % first 
and second class, with the rank of captain of 
the first and second class; and Obet 
(which may be rendered first assistant sur- 
geons), who have the rank of first lieutenant. 
Some of the regiments have assigned to them 
a nondescript medical official known as an 
OberwunJarzt, which literally would mean 
"over surgeon," using surgeon in a sense in- 
ferior to that of physician or doctor. — The 
French have a term, " infirmier- major," which 
describes their functions more accurately. 
These are not generally doctors of medicine, 
do not belong to the corps of medical officer^, 
and their relative rank is that of second lieu- 
tenant. The assignments of medical officers 
to regiments in peace, however, are often 
made in excess of the numbers laid down 
above, as some infantry regiments have as 
many as six medical officers. When all the 
battalions of the regiment are in a single gar- 
rison, which is not often the case, a less num- 
ber of medical officers is required than when 
some of the battalions are detached. In

time of peace the infantry companies do not 
carry on their rolls any bearers or Blessirten- 
trager, but in order that there may be trained 
men on hand, in case of war, for the positions 
of Blessirten-trager and Bandagen-trager, one 
private in each company and one corporal in 
each battalion (twenty men per regiment) 
are kept under instruction by the senior med- 
ical officer. 

In case of mobilization, the number of 
medical officers in each regiment is raised to 
eight, of whom seven are with the staff and the 
field battalions, and one with the Ersatz bat- 
talion. These additional officers are obtained 
from the reserve officers of grades similar to 
those held by the active regimental medical 
officers, and from the one-year volunteer 
Assistenz-arzte, or second assistant-surgeons. 
These latter officers have the rank of second 
lieutenant. 

Each company on a war footing has three 
Blessirten-trager, and each regiment has five 
Blessirten-trager non-commissioned officers 
and eight Bandagen-trager — "bandage bear- 
ers," i. e. dressers, or hospital assistants. 

The independent Rifle battalions have each 
one medical officer, in time of peace or war, 
who is either a first- or a second-class regi- 
mental Arzt. In time of war the battalion 
has one non-commissioned officer bearer, and 
two hospital assistants. Each company has 
the same number of bearers as an infantry 
company. 

Every military medical officer carries on 
his person in the field a small pouch contain- 
ing a few medicines, some court-plaster, ab- 
sorbent cotton, etc., and a pocket instrument- 
case. Every non-commissioned officer and 
soldier of the combatant arms is supplied, on 
mobilization, with a small dressing-packet 
which contains the necessary material for the 
first dressing of a wound, and which is" car- 
ried constantly on the person in one of the 
pockets of the jacket or trousers. Such other 
sanitary material as is immediately necessary 
on the march or on the field of battle is packed 
in knapsacks or pouches, and carried, in cases 
of emergency, by the body-bearers and ban- 
dage-bearers; these knapsacks or pouches 
are habitually carried on the march in the 
covered baggage-wagon assigned to the staff 
of each particular organization (regiment, 
battalion, or Abtheilung). The regimental or 



battalion train contains no wagon or van espe- 
cially assigned to the Medical Department. 
For operations in mountainous countries, each 
battalion has, in addition to the supplies in 
the pouches of the bearers, a reserve of sani- 
tary material for the first dressing- stations, 
which is packed in two panniers and carried 
by a pack animal. This supply of material 
is at the disposal of the medical officer of the 
battalion 

The regular number of medical officers for 
a Cavalry regiment is three, though, as in an 
infantry regiment, the number actually on 
duty may be greater or less than that pre- 
scribed by regulations. In time of war the 
regulation number of medical officers is also 
three. No enlisted men are carried on the 
rolls as bearers, either in peace or in war, 
and no enlisted men of cavalry are trained 
in sanitary duties in peace. The duties of 
the sanitary service for the cavalry are, in 
time of war, discharged by detachments of 
the sanitary troops. 

To each one of the fourteen corps Artil- 
lery regiments the regulations assign two 
medical officers in time of peace, and to each 
one of the forty-two divisional artillery regi- 
ments is assigned one medical officer. — These 
numbers are not strictly adhered to, however. 
In time of war two medical officers are allowed 
to each field artillery regiment, one of whom 
is generally taken from the reserve, and one 
additional medical officer is allowed for such 
regiments as have a horse battery division, 
the horse batteries being detached for service 
with the cavalry. No bearers are carried on 
the rolls in time of peace, but each field bat- 
tery has in war four (two upper and two under) 
Blessirten-trager. The horse batteries have 
none, their bearer service being performed 
by detachments of sanitary troops, as in the 
case of the cavalry. To the staff of 
corps and divisional artillery regiment are 
also attached in time of war, one corporal 
Blessirten-trager and two Bandagen-trager 
(privates). In time of peace a limited amount 
of instruction in hygiene and first aid is 
given to the enlisted men of artillery, much 
the same as that given to the enlisted men 
of infantry, but nothing is fixed as to the 
number of men that are to be kept under in- 
struction in these branches. Sanitary mate-

ril or i st of October immediately 
following the gaining of the doctor's degree, 
and this time, as already indicated, may also 
be included to make up the year's service in 
the ScidaUnstand. This officer is, in rank, 
assimilated to the Cadet-Officer-Stellvertreter, 
a grade in the Austrian Army which corre- 
sponds very closely to that of Porte-Eprc- 
Fahnrich in the German Army. Immediately 
after the granting of the degree of Doctor 
of Medicine, an authenticated list of the doc- 
tor's diplomas is sent to the War Ministry, 
and on the basis of this exhibit appoint- 
ments are made to the grade of Assistenz- 
arzt-stellvertrcter, and the successful candi- 
dates are assigned to the various sanitary 
institutions and establishments. 

The Assistcnz-arzt-stellvertreter, during his 
time of service, is instructed both theoreti- 
cally and practically. After the completion 
of his service he undergoes an examination 
on a prescribed list of subjects, and may then 
— if he is an applicant for a commission in 
the medical corps of the Army, and has satis- 
fied all the requirements for admission thereto 
— be commissioned as Oberarzt or first assis-

VII. THE BRITISH ARMY Ml 

THE MEDIC ' CORPS.* 

Up to the sixteenth century the value of 
military surgeons was gradually being ac- 
knowledged in England, but the temper of 
the times in regard to their encouragement 
may be estimated from what we read in Gore: 
"The poor soldiers, when severely wounded, 
were discharged with a small gratuity, to find 
their way home as best they might." This 
practice prevailed as based on the principle 
that "it cost more to cure a soldier than to 
buy a recruit." 

At the time of the formation of a stand- 
ing army, and toward the end of the Stuart 
period, the ranks of the medical officers were: 
Regimental Mate, Hospital Mate, Regimental 
Surgeon, Apothecary to general hospita 
geon to hospital, Surgeon-General. A dis- 
tinction of some importance between ; 
cian and surgeon was also made at this time, 
and existed till the middle of the eighteenth 
century — so much so that not unfrequently, 
during Marlborough's campaign in Germany, 
we read of the commander-in-chief promoting 
a surgeon to be a physician: and as late as 
1764, Brocklesby wrote how necessary it was 
that the military surgeons should be educated 
as physicians. The two services, naval and 
military, were not so distinct during this 
period as they are now. Sir Thomas Long- 
more, in his " Life of Wiseman," writes: 
" Officers of all branches of the military ser- 
vice, and of all ranks, occasionally held com- 
missions for sea service at one time, and at 
another time for service on land." During 
the campaigns of Marlborough it was gener- 
ally considered effeminate to be ill, but event- 
ually the terrible battles of that time, and the 
fever stricken countries in which operations 
were carried on, gave the fighting man the 
benefits to which he was entitled. 

At that period the clever administration, in-

THE MEDICAL AGE. 






domitable courage and perseverance of the 
senior medical officer, Sir John Pringle, kept 
the medical service prominent, and, under 
the greatest difficulties, proved absolutely the 
necessity for the presence of a proper pro- 
portion of the relieving element to the fight- 
ing strength. Medical officers then, and 
until 1796, not unfrequently held double 
commissions and could act in the double 
capacity of captain and surgeon. Sir John 
Pringle, the surgeon-general serving with the 
troops under Marlborough, initiated the sys- 
tem of regimental, field and general hospitals; 
and the records show that after the battle of 
Fontenoy, May nth, 1745, a general hospital 
was opened at Ath, which cared for upwards 
of 600 wounded. In the same war a general 
hospital was opened at Ghent, which received 
1500 sick and wounded. 

The first assignment of medical officers 
and their hospitals to an army in the field, in 
anticipation of their being used, was in the 
Peninsular War; Sir J. McGrigor, afterwards 
director-general, was the principal medical 
officer, and the idea was that every regiment 
should take care of its own sick and in this 
way avoid crowding in the general hospital. 
This scheme answered its purpose then, as is 
proved by the fact that during the ten 
months' interval between the siege of Bruges 
and the battle of Vittoria 95,348 sick and 
wounded passed through the hospital, and 
yet, by the assiduous care of the medical 
officers, there were only 5000 sick on the eve 
of the battle, the ranks being recruited by 
convalescents who had been properly treated 
and returned to duty. This war produced 
many improvements, which were, however, 
i chiefly confined to the interior economy and 
administration of general and regimental hos- 
pitals; while the organization, personnel, and 
general character of medical establishments 
scarcely underwent any change. Indeed, 
there was at this period no ambulance corps 
in the British service corresponding to the 
medical staff corps of the present times. A 
corps called the " Royal Waggon Train " was 
organized in 181 2 for general transport and 
commissariat purposes — wagons with springs 
were especially designated as part of its equip- 
ment for the carrying of sick and wounded 
men, — but afterwards proved defective, and 
was finally broken up in 1833. 



On the outbreak of the Crimean War, the 
" Hospital Conveyance Corps" was origi- 
nated, recruited for the most part from mili- 
tary pensioners and other non-effectives, its 
duties were the transportation of wounded 
from the battle-field to places of safety, and 
to supply general and other hospitals with 
attendants so as to prevent drawing on the 
effective ranks; also to take charge of the 
transport, and to furnish servants for the 
officers of the general medical staff. This 
establishment failed, owing, amongst other 
reasons, to the total want of training of the 
men composing the corps — they were not 
accustomed to such varied service, nor to 
work together; further, they were advanced 
in years and generally drunken and dis- 
orderly in habits. Indeed, before the actual 
hostilities had commenced, fresh men were 
enrolled and a new system organized. The 
medical staff officers oversaw in a general 
manner the work of the hospital conveyance 
corps, but there was no system of command, 
and neither discipline nor authority could be 
directly enforced by them. 

In the beginning of 1857, after a short in- 
terregnum, when the Land Transport Corps 
carried out the duties connected with the 
executive of military hospitals, there was 
practically no ambulance system. There 
were physicians and surgeons attached to 
corps, and there was a general medical staff 
service, but no cohesion or working form of 
organization; not the least important of the 
reasons for this inefficiency was the absence 
of medical supplies and appliances. It must 
be observed that the transport of the sick, 
which the Land Transport Corps had under- 
taken, is only one of the functions of a medi- 
cal corps; the other and most important 
duties, those pertaining to conveyance of the 
wounded from the field of battle, and attend- 
ing the sick and wounded in hospitals, still 
remained to be provided for; and as military 
medical officers had no connection with the 
Land Transport or any other corps, this pro- 
vision was rendered more difficult. The 
regimental Orderly system, which has been 
in existence since the days of the Peninsular 
War, worked fairly well under regimental 
medical officers, but was open to disadvan- 
tages which rendered it necessary that the

By royal warrant, June iith, 1855, the first 
" Medical - * was organ 

sisting of nine compar, nty-eight 

strong, and arranged "to be employed in any 
bat may be required in the performance 
of hospital duties." There was scarcely any 
military feature in its organization, which 
fact materially facilitated its downfall three 
months later, notwithstanding the provisions 
of a second warrant, when (December 20th, 
I the "Army Hospital Corps" was sub- 
stituted therefor. 

The failure of the "Medical Staff Corps" 
was mainly due to the doubtful and anoma- 
lous position in respect to its relations with 
the combatant authorities; the men of the 
corps for the most part acted in hospitals 
under medical officers who were not invested 
with military authority and who had no 
power of awarding punishment for offenses; 
a considerable proportion of them were un- 
drilled and untrained in the strict require- 
ments of discipline — this was the case not 
only as to the men, but with the stewards and 
ward-masters as well. The latter, though 
having the relative rank of non-commissioned 
officers, had none of the corresponding pow- 
ers of command, and were not permitted 
to wear on their uniforms the insignia of 
their rank. The corps was filled for the 
most part by the transfer of men of good 
character from regiments after a certain 
term of service, usually two years; and each 
man so transferred was required to pass a 
probationary period of three months in a 
military hospital before he was permanently 
appointed to the corps. 

In 1858 a royal commission under the pres- 
idency of the Right Honorable Sidney Her- 
bert was ordered for the purpose of inquiring 
into the regulations affecting the sanitary 
condition of the Army, the organization of 
military hospitals, and the treatment of the 
sick and wounded. The report of this com- 
mission was of the greatest importance to the 
medical service, leading to improvements 
not alone in efficiency but in the status and 
position of its officers. Through it, two 
fundamental changes were introduced — the 
remodeling of the department, and the or- 
ganization of a practical Army Medical 



School. From this period a ^ r reat tendency 
to improve the condition of military m&lt; 
me man if- 

The regimental system (or that in which 
medical officers were an integral part of the 
- iit), which had existed for so long a 
period, and was still in force, though it had 
been of great service in the pa :ound 

to be incompatible with the development of 
the Army medical service; and in conse- 
quence, in March, 1S73, a royal warrant, de- 
vised by Mr. Card well, then Secretary of State 
for War, abolished the regimental system and 
placed all medical officers in one staff or de- 
partment. Even up to 18S9, those of the 
army medical staff doing duty with the 
Household Troops w r ere purely regimental 
officers, but subsequent to this date no offi- 
cers have been gazetted to the junior ranks, 
these being filled by the medical staff officers 
attached for duty; surgeon-majors of regi- 
ments are, however, still regimental officers, 
and as vacancies occur officers of the general 
list will be gazetted to fill them. 

A second warrant, of same date, organized 
the Army Hospital Corps for extended duties 
in connection with hospital service. Two 
new ranks were created, entitled "Captain of 
Orderlies" and "Lieutenant of Orderlies," 
while the rank of Apothecary to the forces, 
dating from 1854, was abolished. In the 
same year regimental hospitals ceased to 
exist, and it was directed that military hospi- 
tals should be organized and administered 
either as general hospitals, station hospitals, 
or field hospitals. 

In 1 87 7, authority was given to medical 
officers to command the officers, non-com- 
missioned officers and men of the army hos- 
pital corps, and also all patients in military 
hospitals, as well as soldiers attached to them 
for duty. In 1SS1 the captains and lieuten- 
ants of orderlies were gazetted as Quarter- 
masters, Army Hospital Corps, and placed 
on the same footing as regards pay and 
retiring allowances as quartermaster^ of in- 
fantry. 

In 1S83 a committee, under the presidency 
of Lord Morley, was appointed by the Secre- 
tary of State for War, to inquire into the organ- 
ization of the army hospital corps, hospital 
management, and nursing in the field. Sev- 
eral valuable recommendations were made, 






THE MEDICAL AGE. 



051 



among which were: Undivided control of 
hospitals to be vested in medical officers; 
the medical service of the Household Troops 
to be assimilated with that of the Army; 
opportunity to be afforded for practice, in 
peace, in the use of war equipment, both as 
regards bearer companies and field hospitals; 
and the assimilation of the army hospital 
corps with the army medical department, both 
of which were to wear the same uniform. 

In 1884, officers of the army medical de- 
partment and the quartermasters of the army 
hospital corps were designated "The Medi- 
cal Staff," and the warrant officers, non-com- 
missioned officers and men of the army 
hospital corps were designated "The Medi- 
cal Staff Corps." This organization still ob- 
tains. 

On the Army Service Corps now devolves 
the duty of supplying transport for the medi- 
cal department; the transport officer of this 
corps takes orders from the medical officer 
commanding the bearer company or field 
hospital to which the transport is attached. 

In 1889 a committee, under the Earl of 
Camperdown, was appointed to inquire into 
the pay, status and conditions of service of 
the medical officers of the Army and Navy; 
and in 1891 a royal warrant was promulgated 
altering, in some respects, the designation of 
the department ranks of the medical staff, 
and providing for the grant of sick-leave to 
officers of said staff on the same conditions 
as those which are applicable to regimental 
officers. This warrant laid down substantive 
titles for officers of the medical staff as fol- 
lows: Surgeon-Major-General, Surgeon-Col- 
onel, Brigade - Surgeon - Lieutenant - Colonel, 
Surgeon-Lieutenant- Colonel, Surgeon-Major, 
Surgeon-Captain, Surgeon-Lieutenant — these 
to carry precedence and other advantages 
attaching to the rank indicated by the mili- 
tary portion of title, but with limited com- 
mand. The army rank thus conferred on 
medical officers facilitates the performance 
of the duties of command and discipline now 
imposed. Where the military command of 
soldiers is involved, the possession of a mili- 
tary title is convenient for common parlance, 
and enhances the officer's authority. 

The organization of the Army Medical 
Staff comprises a director- general, and a fixed 
establishment of administrative officers, made 



up of ten surgeon-major-generals, twenty- 
four surgeon-colonels, and fifty brigade- 
surgeon-lieutenant-colonels, who, though ex- 
ecutive officers, are available for administra- 
tive duties. There is no fixed establishment 
for each of the remaining ranks of executive 
officers, but the total number averages 763; 
there are also thirty-five quartermasters. 
The Medical Staff Corps consists of thirty- 
six warrant officers, $$6 staff sergeants and 
sergeants, and 2030 rank and file. The 
Director-General, under the commander-in- 
chief, is the responsible head of the depart- 
ment, and charged with the administration 
and command of the army medical staff and 
medical staff corps; also of the militia medi- 
cal staff and corps, the militia reserve of the 
medical staff corps, and the medical estab- 
lishment of the Army including the army 
medical reserve of officers, besides the volun- 
teer staff and corps, and the nursing service. 
The surgeon-major-generals and surgeon- 
colonels act as principal medical officers in 
charge of the medical administration of dis- 
tricts and commands; in certain smaller dis- 
tricts, brigade - surgeon - lieutenant - colonels 
perform these duties as senior medical officers. 
The remaining body of officers perform the 
executive duties at all stations at home and 
abroad. The warrant and non-commissioned 
officers and men of the medical staff corps 
are under the command of the officers of the 
army medical staff. 

The full conditions of service in the Army 
Medical Staff are laid down in the royal war- 
rant for pay and promotion, and, briefly 
stated, are as follows: An officer, after three 
years' full-pay service as surgeon- lieutenant, 
if favorably reported on, is promoted to the 
rank of surgeon-captain, and after twelve 
years' full-pay service, including at least 
three years abroad, and having passed a 
satisfactory examination, is again promoted, 
acquiring the rank of surgeon-major; in turn, 
a surgeon-major is promoted, if recommended, 
to surgeon-lieutenant-colonel, after twelve 
years' full-pay service. All promotions to 
the fixed establishments of the higher ranks 
are governed by seniority, tempered by selec- 
tion with due regard to ability and merit. 
The regulations as to the full pay, half-pay 
and retired pay of the different ranks are 
laid down in the royal warrant for pay, etc.

The regulations as to the regimental pay, 
the additional corps pay which the men 
ordinarily receive, and the extra- duty pay 
given them under special circumstances, are 
laid down in the royal warrant for pay, etc. 
The transport of all hospital establishments 
is carried out by the Army Service Corps. 

The arms of the Medical Staff Corps are a 
short sword bayonet. The equipment is as 
for infantry, but with the valise pattern of 
All recruits go through a special 
course of musketry. On field service, the 
Medical Staff Corps is supplied with arms 
and ammunition in the usual manner. It 
should be added here, that if England were 
fighting a nation under the terms of the 
Geneva Convention, the Medical Staff Corps 
would be strictly neutral, and would not be 
in possession of arms or ammunition. 

The inspection of the Medical Staff Corps 
is carried out half-yearly by the principal 
medical officer of the district, who also re- 
ceives reports of the officers of the army 
medical staff serving under him, and satisfies 
himself that they are efficient in all the de- 
tails of their duty; he also inspects the hos- 
pital, examines into its interior economy, and 
renders confidential reports on the officers 
serving in his district, annually, through the 
general officer commanding, after inquiring 
into their military and professional efficiency. 

It is generally held, so far as medical ar- 
rangements are concerned, that on mobiliza- 
tion there should be preparation made for 
reception of 20,000 wounded in London; also 
that medical officers and men for the various 



units, field hospitals, and bearer companie 
for three mobile arm 5, should be de- 

ld ready for immediate mobilization. 
This has been done, and tables have been 

showing in detail how the arrang 
ments are to be carried out. In additii 
each genera] officer commanding a district is 
directed to prepare a scheme of defense for 
such district, with the forces and equipment, 
civil and military, at his disposal. All ar- 
rangements are made with a lighter scale of 
equipment than for foreign service, it being 
assumed that the campaign will be very 
brief; no tents or heavy field equipment are 
arranged for. A pamphlet will shortly be 
issued with army orders giving "Instructions 
for the Organization and Distribution of the 
Army Medical Staff, Medical Staff Cor. 
and Militia and Volunteer Medical Staff 
Corps, on Mobilization for Home Defense." 

As auxiliaries and reserves, there is a body 
of 1200 non-commissioned officers and men 
of the militia reserve, who are annually 
trained in the duties ot the Medical Staff 
Corps, and by royal warrant, dated June 6th, 
1 89 1 , the formation of a Militia Medical Staff 
Corps has been approved. This corps, when 
raised,* will comprise the ranks of surgeon- 
major, surgeon-captain, surgeon-lieutenant, 
sergeant, corporal, and private, who are to 
receive the pay and allowance laid down in 
Regulations for Militia, 1893. Another large 
and important auxiliary to the Medical Staff 
Corps is furnished by the Volunteer Service. 
Ever since the commencement of the volun- 
teer movement, medical officers have been 
attached to each volunteer corps or battalion; 
but by Army Circular, Clause 59, of 1886, a 
royal warrant was published, which provided 
that with a view to the further development 
of the medical organization of the volunteer 
force, a corps, to be designated the Volunteer 
lical Staff Corps, should be formed, com- 
prising the following ranks; Surgeon-lieuten- 
ant-colonel, surgeon-major, surgeon-captain, 
and surgeon-lieutenant, quartermaster, first- 
and second-class staff sergeants, sergeant- 
bugler, sergeant, corporal, bugler, private. 
Like other volunteer corps, the Volunteer 
Medical Staff Corps has a permanent staff

from the regular army, consisting of. an adju- 
tant — who is a surgeon-captain of the army 
medical staff, — an acting sergeant-major, and 
sergeant -instructors who are non-commis- 
sioned officers of the Medical Staff Corps. 
Originally, the Volunteer Medical Staff Corps 
consisted of only one division company in 
London; but there are now companies in Ed- 
inburgh, Woolwich, Manchester, Maidstone, 
Leeds, Aberdeen, Norwich, and Glasgow. 
Since the organization of volunteer infantry 
brigades in 1888, a brigade-surgeon has been 
appointed on the staff of each brigadier-gen- 
eral, who is responsible to the Director-Gen- 
eral through the principal medical officer of 
the district, and has under his orders the 
regimental surgeons of the several corps 
forming the brigade; under this system also 
brigade bearer companies have been formed, 
composed of men taken from the fighting 
ranks, no provision having as yet been made 
for volunteers to qualify as efficients other- 
wise than through the usual training and 
drill with their corps, and they are trained 
in ambulance work as secondary duty. 

By royal warrant dated February 18th, 
1888, an Army Medical Reserve of officers 
was established. In the Secretary of State's 
instructions on the warrant, it was laid down 
that medical officers of the militia, yeomanry, 
and volunteers, on electing to join this re- 
serve, should undertake to perform any duties 
at home at the rates of remuneration laid 
down for civilian medical practitioners in the 
royal warrant for pay, and that officers of 
the Army Medical Reserve would have a 
prior claim to employment in the district in 
which they reside, over other medical officers 
of the auxiliary forces or civilian practition- 
ers. The medical officers on the retired list, 
who are liable to be recalled to service, are 
shown in the quarterly official army list; as 
is also the army medical reserve of officers of 
the ranks, from surgeon-lieutenant to surgeon- 
lieutenant-colonel. Promotion is given regu- 
larly according to length of service on fulfill- 
ment of the prescribed rules. 

Candidates for services in the Army Medi- 
cal Staff on the west coast of Africa enter 
under the same qualifications as for the Army 
Medical Department generally, except that 
they may be admitted at a later age. They 
are required to complete three years' service 



on the coast, after which they will be eligible 
for general service. For each year's service 
on the coast, an officer is entitled to a year's 
leave at home on full pay, and each year or 
portion of the same served on the coast 
reckons double towards volunteer retirement 
on retired pay. 

The Nursing Service is divided into three 
grades: Lady superintendents, senior nursing 
sisters (or acting lady superintendents), and 
nursing sisters. No candidate for the ap- 
pointment of nursing sister may be under 
twenty-five or over thirty-five years of age, 
and each applicant must produce an extract 
from the register of her birth, or, in default, 
a declaration made before a magistrate by 
one of her parents or guardians, giving exact 
age; must also produce a recommendation 
from some person of social position, not a 
member of her own family, as to standing in 
society, and some testimony as to possession 
of tact, temper, and ability qualifying for ap- 
pointment; must sign a declaration showing 
whether she is single, married, a widow, or 
member of any sisterhood or society; must 
produce a certificate of health and evidences 
of having had at least three years' prelimi- 
nary training and service combined, in an 
approved civil hospital, where adult male 
patients receive medical and surgical treat- 
ment, and in which a staff of nursing sisters, 
under a matron, is maintained; finally, must 
produce certificates of efficiency in medical 
and surgical nursing from the medical officers 
under whom she has served. Nursing sisters 
are retired after the age of sixty years, on a 
pension; if disabled in the service before 
that age, the amount of pension or gratuity 
is regulated by the length of service. They 
are rationed and allowed a uniform free of 
all expense, and also certain allowances for 
washing and attendance. They are placed 
under a strict discipline, their duties being 
very fully defined, and the lady superinten- 
dent — or the acting lady superintendent — is 
responsible to the principal medical officer 
for their work. Nursing sisters serve abroad, 
and are detailed for foreign service by the 
Director-General, as far as the exigencies of 
the service will permit, according to a roster. 

The existence in peace of a body of mili- 
tary medical officers, and of a corps of trained 
orderlies and sick-attendants, is essentially

The general treatment of the sick, 
men, women, and children; careful ohserva- 
llation of the sanitary sunound- 
S of the soldiers, bearing in mind the 
various conditions of service in climates of 
widely varying character; prevention as well 
as the treatment of d examination and 

pass ecruits for the Army; invaliding 

of men who are physically unfit for further 
Service; management and control of the vari- 
ous classes of hospitals, general hospitals,

children; supervision and control of all offi- 
cers and men, both patients and those doing 
duty in these various hospitals; the command, 
discipline, and interior economy of the Medi- 
cal Staff Corps. 

In these days of progress and improved 
education, knowledge of sanitary science and 
of the ordinary rules for the preservation of 
health is almost universal among all classes; 
the duty, consequently, of a medical officer 
in advising his general, or other command- 
ing officer, upon sanitary questions, is much 
lightened and facilitated. Old prejudices 
are disappearing; there is less friction, and 
both commanding and medical officers under- 
stand each other on these points, and work 
together for the common good of the soldiers. 
It is the practice to place medical officers in 
immediate charge of the troops in certain 
sections of a garrison, and by this means — if 
not changed too frequently — they become 
acquainted with the localities and with the 
several commanding officers, between whom 
and these medical officers it is very desirable 
there should be frequent periodical communi- 
cation, whereby the interests of the service 
may be best compassed. 

Junior medical officers are not placed in 
actual charge of regiments on home service, 
though in India this is sometimes done. The 
adoption of the station hospital system has 
rendered the old system in this respect un- 
necessary, though it is undoubtedly a fact 
that it would be most desirable for young 
officers to be attached regimentally for a 
fixed period, and there gain an insight into 



regimental ways and the inner working of 
■".dier's daily life, as a good preparation 

for the responsible dm rred to in the 

previous paragraph. 

General hospitals are organized for ti, 

ception of invalids from India and 
the &gt;ick of corps at stations, and all entitled 
illy authorized to be admitted into 
military hospitals. There is also separate 
and special accommodation for sick and 
wounded officers. The general hospitals in 
England are: The Royal Victoria Hospital 
at Xetley, and the Herbert Hospital at Wool- 
wich. 

Station hospitals are established for the 
reception and treatment of sick from all 
corps in garrison, auxiliary troops when em- 
bodied, and all other persons who may be 
admitted under special sanction; each is 
commanded by a medical officer appointed 
by the Director-General, usually a surgeon- 
lieutenant-colonel or a surgeon-major, sub- 
ject to the general officer or other officer in 
command of the troops at the station. An 
establishment of officers of the medical staff, 
and warrant officers, non-commissioned offi- 
cers and men of the medical staff corps, is 
provided for each hospital, according to its 
requirements. 

Station hospitals are equipped according 
to schedules laid down. Under certain condi- 
tions they are non-dieted,* as in some barracks 
where the station hospital is some distance 
off; they are called "auxiliary" or "conva- 
lescent" hospitals, and contain a few beds for 
cases of accident, or the like, and an inspec- 
tion room where the medical officers in local 
charge can examine soldiers, or others who 
report themselves sick. 

Hospitals on board ships are organized 
and conducted similarly to non-dieted station 
hospitals, the equipment in each case being 
placed by the Admiralty. 

Lunatic hospitals are only established in 
connection with general hospitals, and ar* 
administered under similar regulations; they 
are subject to the authority of the Commis- 
sioners of Lunacy. 

Hospitals for soldiers' wives and children 
are organized and administered as station

hospitals. These are much assisted by the 
kindly interest taken in them by officers' 
wives and other philanthropic persons, and 
are not wholly maintained by government, 
special funds for their support being raised 
by voluntary contributions, and valuable as- 
sistance given, both in money and kind. 

In time of war, the duties of medical offi- 
cers and the Medical Staff Corps are, as a 
rule, of an exceptionally arduous and respon- 
sible nature. A large proportion of the ac- 
tive military service in which British tropps 
are engaged, is performed in tropical and 
unhealthy countries, against savages to 
whom the Geneva Convention and the 
courtesies of modern warfare are unknown; 
consequently, sick and wounded cannot in 
case of emergency or retreat be left to. the 
care of the enemy, but must be carefully 
guarded and treated and removed to a place 
of safety, since abandonment would result 
only in torture and death. The arrangements 
for medical assistance with an army in the 
field are: A medical officer with each unit, 
regiment, body of artillery, corps, or staff, 
who has at his disposal the trained regimental 
stretcher-bearers, two per company or troop. 
To each brigade a bearer company is at- 
tached, and there is one field hospital. To 
each division an additional field hospital is 
allowed. For an army corps the medical 
establishment consists of ten field hospitals 
and six bearer companies, exclusive of the 
regimental aid. In addition to this, a certain 
number of officers of the medical staff are 
utilized for staff purposes, and are shown in 
the lists of field establishments. With a 
cavalry division, which is considered sepa- 
rately from the army corps, there are two 
bearer companies and three field hospitals. 

The entire medical service is under the 
command of a Surgeon-Major-General, who 
is included with the staff of the General com- 
manding the line of communications, and sub- 
ject to the authority of the General command- 
ing-in-chief. When a soldier falls wounded 
in the fighting line, he is reached and attended 
to as quickly as possible by the medical offi- 
cers attached to the regiment or corps, carried 
or assisted to the collecting-station, and 
handed over to the bearer company. The 
collecting-station is the advanced post of 
pack-animal ambulance transport and the 



various forms of wheeled carriage, and is 
usually in charge of a non-commissioned offi- 
cer who has a small supply of restoratives 
for the more seriously injured. To this point 
all the wounded are conveyed, and are placed 
on the transport vehicles, to be passed on to 
the dressing-station, about 1500 to 2000 
yards from the fighting line. The dressing- 
station is specially adapted for relieving the 
most seriously wounded, restoring those who 
are exhausted, and for performing necessary 
operations; it is provided with a tent and 
medical and surgical panniers. The staff con- 
sists of two or three officers of the medical 
staff, according to the' regiments, and ten 
non-commissioned officers and men, including 
a cook. The transport and attendance on the 
wounded from the fighting line, through these 
two posts of succor, is performed by the 
bearer company. These two stages comprise 
the " First Line of Assistance." From the 
dressing-station the wounded are passed, by 
road or railway, to the field hospital, which is 
placed in some suitable position beyond the 
range of fire, or under cover from it. There 
is here provision for men to remain two 
or three days if necessary, and they may be 
either discharged to duty again or passed to 
the base hospital along the line of communi- 
cation. The duration of the transit depends 
upon the distance of the fighting line from 
the base, and the nature of the transport 
used; this forms the " Second Line of Assis- 
tance." When the distance is great, hospitals 
on the line of communication are formed, and 
the journey of the sick and wounded is made 
by stages to the base. The base hospital is 
formed usually at or near the port of em- 
barkation for England, and consists of a large 
staff with every possible appliance for care 
and treatment of the wounded; this forms 
the ' k Third Line of Assistance." Invaliding 
boards are held regularly at the base hospital, 
and the sick and wounded are either returned 
to the front or sent home; and with the ob- 
ject of meeting the requirements, hospital 
ships are equipped, so that the soldier lacks 
nothing to give him the best possible chance 
of recovering from the effects of climate or 
injuries. The last stage is disembarkation in 
England, and transfer to the Royal Victoria 
Hospital at Netley, or some other hospital.

THIRTEEN FEET OF INTESTINE TORN 
AWAY. 

A few weeks ago I was called to see a lady 
who had either performed an abortion on 
herself or some one had done so for her. 
The foetus had been delivered, but the pla- 
centa remained in the cavity of the uterus. 
A physician was called, who discovered 
something protruding from the os, and, upon 
investigation, found it was an intestine. 
There was considerable haemorrhage and 
very severe pain, with the prospect of speedy 
death. I found the pulse and respiration 
very rapid and a profuse haemorrhage from 
the vagina. As soon as possible I opened 
the abdomen, and found the uterus about the 
size of a five months' pregnancy and very 
soft, the abdominal cavity quite filled with 
blood. Upon lifting the uterus out I dis- 
covered, on its posterior surface, an opening, 
through which passed a loop of small intes- 
tine. This I immediately withdrew; its mes- 
entery had been stripped entirely off. One 
end of the intestine had been torn from its 
attachment to the coecum. I inserted my 
finger into the cavity of the uterus, and, find- 
ing the placenta, delivered it, enlarging the 
opening. I cut off the intestine at the point 
where the mesentery stopped, making a lat- 
eral anastomosis with the coecum on the op- 
posite side. I then closed the wound. Thir- 
teen feet of the intestine had been drawn 
through the opening in the uterus. The 
patient died at 12.30 a.m., one remarkable 
feature being that she survived the injury 
and subsequent operative procedure over 
eight hours. — Do&lt; roR C. B. Nichols, in

TREATMENT OF MALIGNANT TUMORS 
WITHOUT THE KNIFE. 

For years there has been a persistent 
attempt on the part of the medical profes- 
sion to eradicate malignant growths without 
resorting to radical operation. That these 
efforts have rarely been attended with suc- 
cess, is evident from the fact the knife still 
obtains general preference; moreover, there 
are certain growths which cannot reasonably 
be expected to come within the scope of any- 
thing but active surgical measures. 

To be sure, where growths are small and 
unaccompanied with any marked infiltration 
of surrounding tissues, they may often be 
most readily relieved by caustics, among 
which caustic potash, Vienna paste, lactic acid 
— and other agents of like character — have 
received first place; and here it may be 
proper to register an individual preference 
for lactic and chromic acids, and also a belief 
that of the two, the latter, when employed 
judiciously, possesses special advantages, par- 
ticularly as regards gynaecological work. 

A fact that seems to have escaped general 
attention is that cancerous tumors of consid- 
erable size have been, in a few instances at 
least, permanently relieved without the knife, 
and without the horrible ulceration and in- 
jury to health that accrue to usual non-opera- 
tive measures. In the Medical Times and 
Gazette for September, 1866, Doctor \V. II. 
Broadbent called attention to the possibilities 
of Acetic Acid as an interstitial injection in 
the removal of malignant growths, and cited 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 






a number of cases in which permanent relief 
had resulted from its employment. 

One case, carcinoma of the breast, of two 
years' standing, was operated upon in August, 
1865 — that is, removed by the knife. In the 
succeeding May a new tumor, growing more 
rapidly than ever, appeared under the cica- 
trices of the former operation, the conditions 
being such that further use of the knife was 
inexpedient and inadvisable. In this instance, 
unless something could be done, a miserable 
fate awaited the patient. Finally Doctor 
Broadbent bethought himself that it might 
be possible to inject the tumor with some 
fluid that would tend to so far alter its struc- 
ture and modify its nutrition as to retard or 
arrest its growth. After due deliberation 
Acetic Acid was selected, for the reason, as 
he says: 

That as it does not coagulate albumen, and 
might be expected to diffuse itself through the 
tumor, the effects would not be localized at the 
point of injection: 

If it entered the circulation it could in no way 
do harm. — As the tendency of Acetic Acid is to 
rapidly dissolve the walls and modify the nuclei 
of the cells on a microscopic slide, it might reason- 
ably be expected to do the same to cells in situ: 

Finally, Acetic Acid is often applied with advan- 
tage to common ulcerations. 

Accordingly, on the 18th of May the first 
injection was made, the tumor now being the 
size of a small egg, with a patch of skin 
about the size of a twenty-five cent piece ad- 
hering thereto. The hypodermatic needle 
was introduced into sound tissue an inch or 
more from the part involved, and pushed on 
into the centre of the diseased mass, when 
thirty minims of a fluid composed of one 
part of Acetic Acid and two of water were 
injected; there was little or no pain. The 
next morning a bulla containing dark bloody 
fluid was found to occupy the patch of adher- 
ent skin. Five days later this portion of the 
skin was dry, hard, and horny; the adjacent 
part of the tumor more soft than formerly. 
The injection was now repeated. 

Three weeks after the first injection (the 
patient not having been observed for a fort- 
night) it was found the piece of skin before 
mentioned was detached from surrounding 
tissues, and also that a probe could be passed 
in all directions to a distance of three-quar- 
ters of an inch or more between the tumor 



and healthy structures; there was likewise a 
slight discharge from the fissure. Now a 
third injection was made, and two days later 
a fourth, the strength of the solution being 
slightly increased — that is, one-quarter less 
water was added to the Acid; the procedure 
now gave rise to transient pain, speedily fol- 
lowed by swelling and tension of the contigu- 
ous parts. Four days after this last operation 
a free discharge of fluid was established, 
with more or less sloughing of solid portions; 
there was consequent relief from swelling, 
and notably no fcetor. 

After the lapse of another fortnight the 
tumor was much reduced in size, and a probe 
on being passed into the fissure entered a 
large cavity extending on all sides; part of 
the wall seemed free from malignant struc- 
ture, though at several points crusts of can- 
cerous deposits remained. Another attempt 
to inject was futile; the cancerous material 
was too thin to retain the fluid, which either 
entered the fissure, causing great pain, or 
made its way into the cavity; consequently the 
latter was packed with lint freely saturated 
with dilute acid. The case was now turned 
over to the care of the family medical atten- 
dant, with directions to inject whenever he 
saw opportunity. 

Two months after the first injection — viz., 
July 13th — the attending physician reported 
no impression being made on the remaining 
disease, and that he fancied, on the contrary, 
it had somewhat extended. 

Doctor Broadbent now for a few days tried 
carbolic acid as an application, but soon dis- 
continued it as unsatisfactory; he returned 
to dressing daily with strong Acetic Acid, 
and to the injections as often as opportunity 
offered. 

In the early part of the succeeding August 
the patient had considerable hemorrhage, 
necessitating its arrest by the application of 
sesquichloride of iron. In September the re- 
sults of the treatment were very apparent: 
there was every evidence that the final re- 
mains of the malignant growth had been 
eradicated; healthy granulating surface was 
apparent everywhere, which soon healed. 
This appeared to be a permanent cure. 

Subsequently other cases were treated with 
equal success. Doctor Broadbent, however, 
recognized the fact that many forms of ma-

lignant growth are Dot amenable to these 
- obvious. He consid- 
ered, how ;uent application of dilute 
And preferable to the use of the 
and would have great hesitation in 
attempting by this means the destruction of 
any tumor that hail not involved the skin. 

The foregoing certainly commends itself 
logical and m&lt; il grounds. 

The purpose, manifestly, is not to secure ne- 
- of the malignant growth — which always 
accrues to so-called "cancer pastes," — but 
modification of nutrition; and the theoretical 
grounds upon which this is based are that 
"cancer owes its malignancy to its cellular 
or fcetal structure; that Acetic Acid is an 
agent which may reasonably be expected to 
diffuse itself through the growth and, reach- 
ing the cells, to effect changes in their con- 
stitution and vitality, while yet being free 
from any deleterious influence." 

From some personal experience with this 
treatment during the last thirty years, we be- 
lieve it to be applicable to many cases. We 
have often -found dilute Glacial Acetic Acid 
preferable to the ordinary commercial prod- 
uct. One case thus treated is particularly 
notable — that of an individual nearly ninety 
years of age, with malignant tumor of the 
breast that had reached the ulcerating stage; 
any question as to its malignancy will appear 
to be set at rest, since its character had been 
passed upon by no less personages than Willard 
Parker, James Wood, and Lewis A. Sayre. In 
this instance the Acetic Acid speedily segre- 
gated the diseased mass from the surrounding 
sound tissues, which put an end to any further 
attempts at interstitial injection — the fluid 
would pass out into the fissure. Daily appli- 
cation was then made of Glacial Acetic Acid 
with a brush, for a period extending over 
some six or eight months, and with the 
result that the growth was slowly but com- 
pletely eradicated. A peculiarity of the 
Glacial Acid appears to be that when re- 
duced one-half with water it has little or no 
effect upon healthy tissues, while upon mor- 
bid products it remains extremely active. 

Other cases were treated on the same 
general line, with great satisfaction both to 
operator and patients. That favorable re- 
sults are not inevitable will be readily un- 
derstood; furthermore, one of the greatest 



■ '.raw backs to this method is that so few 
M the patience necessary to 

submit to careful test Probably eight-tenths 

of all on whom this method was tried p I 
into other bands for this very reason, some to 
receive temporary relief by the knife; and 
not a few gravitated — as the majority inva- 
riably do — into the hands of cancer quacks, 
with the usual unfortunate termination. 

One most unfortunate case was that of a 
stout, healthy French Canadian, fifty years 
of age, with "smoker's cancer." After two 
months, and when the treatment was most 
promising, he became the victim of a charla- 
tan. A few months later he returned with a 
much aggravated lip and presented all the 
evidences of acute arsenical poisoning. For 
this latter he was put under treatment, no 
attempt being made to interfere with the 
malignant growth. No sooner, however, was 
he recovered than he again placed himself in 
the hands of the charlatan, more from anxiety 
to realize upon the investment he had al- 
ready made in this direction than anything 
else. In a very short period of time he again 
gave evidence of arsenical poisoning, and the 
malignant growth had become so much ex- 
tended there was no hope except through the 
knife. With a persistence worthy of a better 
cause the patient again resorted to the charla- 
tan, but, finally becoming alarmed, visited 
Quebec, where he was operated upon, losing 
the entire lower lip and a large portion of 
the tissue of the left lower face. The dis- 
ease, however, had apparently become stim- 
ulated to unusual activity, and its malignancy 
increased, by the treatment received at the 
hands of the cancer quack, and the man 
speedily succumbed — the growth at last in- 
volving thyroid, larynx, and deep tissues of 
the whole left neck. 

Mention has already been made of the 
use of chromic acid in gynaecological prac- 
tice. Many appear to prefer the acid nitrate 
of mercury, and this agent at one time re- 
ceived an undue degree of prominence in 
this class of practice owing to its recom- 
mendation by the late J. Marion Sims. Per- 
sonal experience, however, has proven it a 
most uncertain and likewise dangerous agent. 
There are many cases in which lactic acid 
may be preferable to chromic, yet in general 
the latter is superior if judiciously applied,

and there is no agent which is so satisfactory 
in the treatment of apparently hopeless malig- 
nant disease of the female genital tract. By 
its means life may be made not only toler- 
able, but further prolonged for a number of 
years; and, finally, in some few instances 
permanent relief may be secured. 



IN RE ANTI=DIPHTHERITIC SERUH. 

Except those based upon reports of hos- 
pital experience, the statistics heretofore pub- 
lished regarding this agent merely include a 
few insufficient cases, and consequently have 
been so incomplete as to be of no practical 
value. It is therefore a matter of some in- 
terest to be able to present statistics derived 
from private practice. Recently M. Eulen- 
berg, before the Berlin Medical Society, pre- 
sented a report extending over a period of 
six months, viz., from October ist, 1894, to 
March 31st, 1895, that has to do entirely with 
diphtheria outside of hospital wards. His 
statistics cover 10,240 cases, of which 5790 re- 
ceived anti-diphtheritic serum, the remainder 
being subjected to other methods of treat- 
ment. 

Of the group of 5790 which received the 
serum, he reports that 552 died — a death-rate 
of 9.5 per cent. Of the second group, who 
received the other methods of treatment, 652 
died — that is to say, a per cent, of 14.6. 

In one instance a publisher, in comment- 
ing upon this report, seeks to call attention 
to the fact that cases treated by means of 
the serum were all very serious. This, how- 
ever, seems to be an error, inasmuch as 
Eulenberg declares the epidemic in Berlin 
during the winter of 1894-95 was a mild one. 

Further analysis of Eulenberg's statistics 
evidences that the death-rate in children 
under two years of age who submitted to the 
serum treatment was 21.7 per cent.; between 
two and ten years, 8.8 per cent.; and over 
the latter age, 4.1 per cent. The fatality 
among those who did not receive the serum 
represented, of those under two years of age, 
39.5 per cent.; from two to ten, 15.2 per 
cent; and over ten years, 3.8 per cent. 

Eulenberg concludes: "As a general thing 
the death-rate among children of a certain 
age, and among grown persons, was very low 



during the last epidemic. The success of 
the serum treatment was proportionate to the 
promptness with which it was begun — thus 
the total death-rate among those who re- 
ceived the serum upon the first or second 
day of the disease was but 4.2 per cent., 
while among those who received it on the 
third day the per cent, rose to 16 8." He 
adds: 

In spite of the discredit which certain mishaps — 
which it would certainly be wrong to conceal — have 
thrown upon the serum treatment of diphtheria, 
this medicament appears the most efficacious yet 
known, and in it physicians will find their most re- 
liable weapon against this terrible disease. 

In a measure corroborative of the fore- 
going, is the report of Doctor Zabolotnui, of 
the District of Podolia, Russia. In 109 cases 
serum was employed, with only fourteen 
deaths, a percentage of 12.8. — In previous 
epidemics the percentage had averaged 48 
per cent. Also prophylactic injections were 
employed in 228 cases, none of which con- 
tracted the disease. Zabolotnui himself 
contracted the disease and underwent the 
serum treatment with apparently most satis- 
factory results. He describes his rapid im- 
provement after the first injection, the dis- 
appearance of headache and the apathetic 
state into which he had fallen, with corre- 
sponding rise in spirits and improvement in 
all specific symptoms. The temperature fell 
from 101 to normal after the first injec- 
tion. 

Doctor W. H. Park recently presented 
before the New York State Medical Asso- 
ciation a paper under the title of "Recent 
Studies in Diphtheria and Pseudo-diphtheria," 
with statistics tending to show that his em- 
ployment of serum was highly beneficial. 
He further declares that the mortality in 
New York City, which for years averaged 34 
per cent., and never less than 25 per cent., 
has during the last nine months been re- 
duced to 17 per cent.; and that if the serum 
"had been used in all cases, the mortality 
would have been less than 10 per cent." 

It is unnecessary to comment upon these 
figures, which appear to be of the most radi- 
cal character. Judgment must be passed 
thereupon by every individual for himself 
in the light of his own knowledge and re- 
searches.

The compression which this r. "tide 

of dress — which renders all women of one 
shape and conceals the true outlines of the 
female form divine — exerts upon the abdomi- 
nal and thoracic organs, prevents full play of 
the respiratory powers and thus on the 

function of haematosis. Further, the action 
of the muscles of the back is interfered 
with — being deprived of all activity they 
speedily lose their power, and hence provoke 
the feeling so aptly expressed by ladies of 
"falling apart" when stays are laid aside. 
It seems full time that stays, high-heeled 
shoes, and certain other useless dictates of 
fashion, should be thrown aside. It is cer- 
tain our women will be both stronger and 
healthier for such reform. 

Why !— 

We have been asked why the Journal does not 
print a list of pamphlets and reprints received each 
month. Our answer is, that to do so would require* 
at least half a page of small type, and that in nine- 
tenths of the cases the only end attained would be 
the advertisement of some nostrum. Somewhere 
in the last three pages of almost every reprint we 
receive, there is a nucleus wherein some nostrum 
— good, bad or indifferent — is recommended. The 
Jo urnal sells advertising space and gives its patrons 
as much consideration as is proper. — Ohio Medical 
J i urnal. 

As several like queries have been pro- 
pounded to The Medical Age, we publish 
the above as exemplifying the situation. 

French Brandy.— 

Doctor Laborde recently read a paper before the 
Academie de Medecine, of Paris, on the liquor sup- 
plied to the French Army under the name of C 
The best cognac is made of the cheapest and worst 
spirit, flavored with oil cognac ("Bouquet de 
Cognac"), which in turn is derived from castor-oil, 
cocoanut-oil, and other fatty substances treated 
with nitric acid. " Pure Jamaica rum," sold by an 
English house, proved, on analysis, to be of much 
the same quality. — Medical Record.

the microbes in margarine thirty-three per 
cent . and in butter but three per cent. 
Pathogenic bacteria are harbored by true 
butter, but not by its margarine imitation. 

The Retort Sarcastic — 

One medical gentleman publishes the state- 
ment that in an experience of twenty years he 
has never lost a case of smallpox. The edi- 
tor goes him one better by adding he has had 
longer experience with equally good results, 
but — he never had a case upon which to try his 
skill. The foregoing suggests that dogmatic 
assertions often contain more sound than 
sense. 

Time for Active Suppression.— 

Some of the prescriptions given by " thr 
dailies" who run a "medical column" are quite 
able to play the deuce with the people who take 
them seriously, even to giving the undertaker a

to "dabble in physic," and this is fostered 
in no small degree by the countenance given

Items and News. 



Longevity and Activity. — 

An item in an exchange reminds us that 
great men usually carry their full mental 
vigor and activity into their great old age — 
M. Chevreul, M. de Lesseps, Gladstone and 
Bismarck are evidences of this anthropologi- 
cal fact. Pius IX., although living in tem- 
pestuous times, reached a great age in full 
possession of all his faculties, and the dra- 
matist Crebillon composed his last dramatic 
piece at ninety-four, whilst Michel Angelo 
was still composing his great canvasses 
at ninety-eight, and Titian at ninety still 
painted with all the vigor of his earlier years. 
The Austrian General Melas was still in the 
saddle and active at eighty, and would have 
probably won Marengo but for the inoppor- 
tune arrival of Desaix. The Venetian Doge, 
Henry Dandolo, born in the beginning of the 
eleventh century, who lost his eyesight when 
a young man whilst on an embassy to Con- 
stantinople, through the treachery of the 
Greek Emperor Manuel, was nevertheless 
subsequently raised to the highest office in 
the republic, managed successfully to con- 
duct various wars, and at the advanced age 
of eighty-three, in alliance with the French, 
besieged and captured Constantinople. Fon- 
tenelle was as gay-spirited at ninety-eight as 
in his fortieth year, and the philosopher 
Newton worked away at his tasks at the age 
of eighty-three with the same ardor that ani- 
mated his physical prime. Cornaro was as 
happy at ninety as at fifty, and in far better 
health at the age of ninety-five than he had 
enjoyed at thirty. These cases all tend to 
show the value and benefits to be derived 
from an actively cultivated brain in making 
a long life one of comfort and of usefulness 
to its owner. The brain and spirits need 
never grow old, even if our bodies will insist 
on getting rickety and in falling by the way- 
side, but an abstemious life will even drag 
that old body along to centenarian limits in a 
tolerable state of preservation and usefulness. 

The foregoing list can be lengthened out 
with an indefinite number of names, but it is 
sufficiently long to show what good spirits 
and an active brain will do to lighten up the 
weight of old age. When we contemplate 
the Doge Dandolo at eighty-three animating 
his troops from the deck of his galley, and 
the brave old blind king of Bohemia falling 
in the thickest of the fray at Crecy, it would 
seem as if there was no excuse for either 
physical, mental or moral decrepitude short 
of the age of four-score and ten. — National 
Popular Review. 



The "Gold-Cure."— 

Reverend Doctor Buckley, the learned edi- 
tor of the Christian Advocate, has made a 
serious attempt to investigate the therapeutic 
value of the so-called "gold-cure." He sent 
out letters of inquiry to a large number of 
physicians and clergymen, and received re- 
plies from ninety-three in all. Through these 
he obtained reports of 534 cases of inebriety 
treated, of which 275 remained cured and 
251 relapsed. This gives a proportion of 
cures of 51% per cent., and it might be said 
that if fifty per cent, are cured, something is 
accomplished; but the answer is that the 
same result can be secured by ordinary meas- 
ures not involving the resort to secret prepa- 
rations. Of 100 drunkards who deliberately 
and honestly desire to break up their habits, 
surely over half will be rescued by measures 
known to the profession. As two-thirds of 
Doctor Buckley's correspondents were clergy- 
men, and many of these were ardent believers 
in the treatment, the percentage of cures ob- 
tained by the inquiry is probably too high. 
Even admitting it to be as high as fifty, the 
validity of the claim that the "gold-cure" is 
a specific is surely disposed of. — Medical 
Record. 

Scientific Foods.— 

The "scientific food " theory has had a set- 
back, having been "weighed in the balance 
and found wanting." A detachment of fifty 
men of the United States Army were sent 
out for a three days' march with "scientific 
rations " in their haversacks — little tablets of 
highly concentrated essences of coffee and 
bread — which, it was imagined, would be as 
serviceable as the bulkier drink and food in 
their usual form. At the end of the first day, 
forty men were doubled up with cramps — 
their digestive organs could not assimilate 
the concentrated food, or were not satisfied 
with it, so the experiment was a failure. 

Man cannot exist upon a chemical diet, for 
the plain reason that he is a man and has 
physical requirements and functions which 
demand food in other form. Much may, of 
course, be done by science to improve food 
supply, to render it more wholesome, more 
efficient, perhaps more convenient and port- 
able, but beyond such limits it can scarcely 
go. Bread is the "staff of life," and, with 
meat, fruit, vegetables, and other adjuncts, is 
apparently destined to remain so to the end 
of time. — New York Tribune.

Hyperpyrexia.— 

The normal temperature of the human 
body is 9S.6 F., with a range in disease, 
usually, of eight to ten degrees above and 
two or three degrees below that point. State- 
ments of wider departures from the normal 
than these are usually received with some 
feeling of skepticism. However, the number 
of cases recording excessively high tempera- 
ture is becoming so great that credence must 
be given them. We gave a r/sumd of such 
reported cases in April, 1893. Another case 
is now reported, by Doctor H. Morgan Miles, 
Jonesville, Va., in the Louisville Medical 
Monthly for April, 1895. In a girl, six years 
old, with diphtheria, under careful and en- 
tirely competent observation, the thermometer 
registered as high as 115 F. Three instru-

.Microbes and Disease Demons.— 

The most ancient and v. A theory 

of disease is the demon theory. The disease 
demon has now reappeared ■ :n. Some 

thirty-six diseases, many of which are the 
most terrible which afflict men and animals, 
are attributed by bacteriologists to micro- 
organisms. I cannot think it can ever be 
true scientific medicine to pour poison into 
the blood current to counteract other poisons; 
we may in one sense convey an antidote, but 
we may work untold mischief by our ignorant 
meddling, which we have no means of com- 
bating.— Edward Burdoe, L.R.C.P. (Ed.), 
M.R.C.S. 

Inebriety.— 

Montyel concludes, inebriety is curable in 
one-third the cases. The basis of treatment 
is complete, compulsory, prolonged absti- 
nence — without this method there is no 
chance of recovery. This abstinence should 
be supplemented by treatment of the condi- 
tion of the nervous system of which inebriety 
is the symptom. The patient should be 
placed under discipline, subjected to an effi- 
cacious surveillance, and the duration of 
treatment should be at least one year. — 
Alienist and Neurologist. 

No riaterial Difference. — 

A gentleman gave a party in honor of a 
celebrated missionary. The ladies appeared 
in very decollette dresses, and the host, fearing 
the style might shock his reverence, apolo- 
gized, saying that fashion demanded it. " Oh, 
I don't mind it at all," replied the missionary; 
"I've been ten years among the savages!" —

Troubles in the Community. —

The twine-maker had the chord-ee; 
The farmer's attack of oat-itis 

And rye-neck was painful to see; 
The wheelman went blind with cycli; 

The bridge-builder suffered from piles, 
The servant girl had Sal-pingilis, 

And the cook was all covered with b'iles.

The Living Age y now near the close of its 
fifty-second year, has ever been the faithful 
mirror of the times, reflecting only that which 
was highest and best and most desirable in 



the whole field of literature. It has received 
the commendations of the highest literary 
authorities, the most distinguished statesmen, 
the brightest men and women of the country, 
and has proven a source of instruction and 
entertainment to many thousands. It com- 
mends itself especially to busy people of 
moderate means, for they will find in it what 
they cannot otherwise obtain except by a 
large expenditure of time and money, yet 
which is so essential to every one who desires 
to be well informed concerning all the great 
questions of the day. 

Recent issues maintain its reputation. To 
enumerate all the choice articles in the Oc- 
tober numbers, for instance, would be to give 
their full tables of contents. We can only add 
what has so often been said, that even at its 
old subscription price no intelligent reader 
can afford to do without this periodical.

Metaphysical Magazine. Volume I: January to 
June, 1895. Cloth; 8vo; pp. 570. Price, $2 50. 
Metaphysical Publishing Co., New York. 

This volume represents the first half-year 
of the Metaphysical Magazine, a journal de- 
voted to occult, philosophical and scientific 
religion — in other words, to a scientific ex- 
amination of the laws of being, to a study of 
the operations and phenomena of the human 
mind, and to systematic inquiry into the fac- 
tors, functions, nature and attributes of the 
soul. It numbers among its contributors such 
authors as Alexander Wilder, S. M. Miller, 
Samuel A. Binion, C. H. A. Bjerregaard, T. 
W. Rhys-Davids, W. J. Colville, L. C. Graham, 
Swami Vive Kananda, Henry Wood, W. C. 
B. Rudolph, Alice Le Plongeon, C. Stanilan 
Wake, J. Emory McLean, Alexander Fuller- 
ton, and Hudor Genone. Notable articles 
are: " The Abolition of Capital Punishment;" 
"A Vision of Being;" "Creation and Evolu- 
tion;" " Building of a Brain;" "Comparative 
Study of the History of Religious Beliefs;" 
"Ethics of Mental Healing;" "Intuition and 
Divination;" "Re-incarnation;" "The Mi- 
crobial! Craze;" "Occult Principles of Ex- 
istence;" "Physical Action in Levitation;" 
"Physico-Astronomical Theology of Easter;" 
"The Brain's Glebe;" and "Wonders of the 
Kabbalah." 

"Unbiased by prejudice, undaunted by the 
tenacity of error and tradition, and free from 
the dominance of preconceived opinion," 
the Metaphysical Magazine certainly has a 
wide future before it. 



The Youth's Companion. Price, $1.75 per year. 
Perry Mason &amp; Co., Boston. 

It is impossible in the limited space at our 
disposal to do anything like justice to the in- 
teresting announcements which this journal 
makes for the ensuing year. It is the ideal 



family paper — clean, interesting, educational. 
Not only are some of the most delightful 
story- writers permanent contributors to it, 
but many of the most eminent statesmen, 
jurists and scientists of the world have been 
engaged for the coming year — in fact, no 
fewer than three Cabinet ministers are an- 
nounced, among them the Secretary of Agri- 
culture, who has chosen for his subject 
"Arbor Day," the celebration of which he 
originated; Secretary Herbert will write on 
"What the President of the United States 
Does," and Secretary Hoke Smith on • 
Indians." In a fascinating group of articles 
under the head of "How I Served my Ap- 
prenticeship," Frank R. Stockton will tell 
how he became an author. General Nelson 
A. Miles will give reminiscences of his army 
experience; and Andrew Carnegie will recall 
his early days in getting a business footing. 

The publishers of the Youth's Companion 
make the following offer to all who at once 
forward $1.75 and enroll themselves as sub- 
scribers for 1896, viz.: They will send free a 
handsome four-page calendar for 1896 (7 by 
10 inches), lithographed in nine colors, the 
retail price of which is fifty cents; also the 
Companion will be sent for the remainder of 
1895 .free of charge, including the Thanks- 
giving, Christmas and New Year's double 
numbers. 



Modern Materia Medica. By Doctor Otto Roth. 

Revised by Doctor Gregor Smith, Wiirzburg. 

Cloth; 8vo; pp.467. Price, $2.00. William Wood 

&amp; Co., New York. 

Modern Materia Medica was translated 
some years ago for Wood's Medical and Sur- 
gical Monographs, and proved so popular that 
the publishers were soon compelled to issue 
it in book form. This volume is a new trans- 
lation of the seventh edition, recently pub- 
lished in Germany, and revised by Doctor 
Gregor Smith. It is brought fully up to date 
and includes the many new drugs which now 
form so important a 'part of the practicing 
physician's pharmacopoeia. Moreover, it is 
replete with formulae and prescriptions. The 
very clear and practical style in which it is 
written cannot fail to make it of the greatest 
assistance to either practitioner or student. 



Modern Development of Harvey's Work. By T. 
Lauder Brunton, M.D.. F.R.S. Cloth; 8vo; pp. 
35. Macmillan &amp; Company, London, England. 

This is the annual " Harveian Oration," 
delivered before the Royal College of Physi- 
cians, October iSth, 1S94. The title suffi- 
ciently explains its scope, which is extremely 
broad; it is a most interesting and scholarly 
address.

He. 



Diseases of the Middle Ear and Labyrintli. 
— Pilocarpine has been widely heralded as a 
remedy for affections of the ear. In two 
cases of dry middle-ear catarrh I gave sub- 
cutaneous injections thereof, but failed to 
induce the 3t improvement. In twenty- 

five other cases, injections of Pilocarpine 
were made directly into the tympanum, and 
with no better results. Subcutaneous injec- 
tions were also employed in some cases of 
labyrinthine disease secondary to tympanic 
mischief, but in no case could beneficial ac- 
tion be determined. In two cases of recent 
implication of the labyrinth, however — one of 
traumatic effusion into, and the other a 
syphilitic affection of, the labyrinth, — distinct 
improvement was obtained. I conclude from 
these experiences that it is only in very re- 
cent affections of the labyrinth, whether syph- 
ilitic, traumatic, or secondary to tympanic 
inflammation, that any good can result from 
hypodermatic injections of Pilocarpine, and 



that the earlier t: -cent is begun the

Treatment of Uramia. — Renaut ei 
to overcome the renal impermeability bj 
plication of leeches to the loins, which he 
- preferable to wet-cupping. — In 188S 
he demonstrated the anastomoses which 

en the subcutaneous blood-vessels of 
the loins and those of the cortex of the kid- 
Inhalations of oxygen may be of use 
in aiding the blood to oxydize the retained 
toxic products. To increase the renal cir- 
culation the muscular substance of the heart 
must be stimulated, and for this purpose the 
administration every four days of one milli- 
gramme of crystallized digitalin is recom- 
mended, and that it be continued even after 
the renal obstruction has been removed. A 
milk diet, although it usually increases the 
daily amount of albumen secreted in the 
urine, is to be preferred on account of its 
diuretic action, and because it is a diet yield- 
ing very little toxic residue. During a 
uraemic attack, subcutaneous injections of 
ether act as a cardiac stimulant, and to 
extent render the nervous system insensible 
to the action of the toxic agents. — Indian 
Medical Record. 



Drugs Many; Remedies Few. — New drugs 
are added every day for the benefit chiefly 
of those who do not know how to employ the 
old ones. 

Many men never set out to prove experi- 
mentally for themselves the value of any 
drug or drugs, and so they never come to a 
condition of mind in which they employ 
remedies with confidence, precision, and suc- 
cess. 

It is the ruin of modern medicine that 
men do not use their minds and base their 
work on the immovable foundation of their 
own proved convictions. 

The old which is tried and proved should 
be loyally preserved: well known drugs 
should be retained, and the new always, in 
every case, and by every individual, subjected 
to continuous and competent examination 
and proving. 

The third-rate practitioner, who has not 
gained a just self-confidence by reason of 
thoroughness and success in practice, always 
" hankers " after the reputation of being thor- 
oughly "up to date." — The Hospitdl. 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 






The Mudar Plant and its Properties. — This 
plant is largely used by the natives of India. 
Five grains of the dried and pulverized root, 
given four times daily, and accompanied by 
a dose of castor oil on alternate days, is con- 
sidered a specific in dysentery; the oil ob- 
tained by boiling equal parts of the dried 
root and mustard oil together for an hour, 
forms a valuable anodyne liniment for rheu- 
matic and other pains; while the lesser roots 
are used as tooth brushes (Miswaak) for 
strengthening the teeth and gums and avert- 
ing toothache. The leaves are heated on 
an iron pan and then tied on to affected parts 
to assuage pain. The flowers are used as a 
specific in fever. The milky juice that ex- 
udes from any part of the living plant when 
bruised, is useful in bringing boils to a head; 
it is employed both internally and externally 
in splenic fever and certain forms of eczema, 
and is recognized as a powerful remedy in 
toothache — indeed, it not only removes the 
pain, but appears to have the property of 
eradicating a loose tooth and of strengthening 
a firmly fixed one. — Indian Medical Record. 



Absolute Alcohol in Erysipelas. — Langsdorff, 
of Baden Baden, claims to have had excel- 
lent results in thirty-two cases of erysipelas 
of the face and other parts of the body by 
treating with compresses saturated in abso- 
lute Alcohol; the painful tension of the skin 
disappeared in from one to two hours, and in 
the course of a day the temperature fell to nor- 
mal. After eight to ten hours, marked swell- 
ing of the skin took place, especially about 
the centre of the inflamed area; new areas of 
the disease often appeared near the border 
of the original patch, which readily yielded, 
however, to renewed applications of Alcohol; 
desquamation followed after some days, at 
which time emollient applications were valu- 
able. No complications, such as connec- 
tive-tissue necrosis from the Alcohol, were 
observed. To prevent evaporation, the com- 
presses must be covered with some imper- 
meable material; and they should be changed 
every fifteen minutes until all inflammation 
has subsided, two to three days being gen- 
erally required. — Boston Medical and Surgical 
Journal. 



Cantharidin in Lupus. — Liebreich believes 
that a satisfactory remedy for lupus must be 
some agent that will not alone destroy bacilli, 
but as well have some effect upon the vital 
forces, his choice being Cantharidin. After 
presenting the peculiar action of the drug and 
showing that medicinal doses, even if con- 
tinued for many months, will not give rise to 



pathological changes in the kidneys, he ii 
it does exert most beneficial effects upon 
eral symptoms, and may be given internally 
as a sodium cantharidinate, the pure drug 
dissolved in tincture of orange-peel (r to 
5000), or by hypodermatic injection. From 
the results obtained, Liebreich concludes 
that the dogma that lupus vulgaris cannot be 
cured without cicatricial tissue is untrue, and 
he demonstrates that Cantharidin has a pre- 
cise and definite curative action. — The, 
tische Monatshefte. 



Cocaine in Whoopi?ig-Cough. — Wells and 
Carre have treated 300 cases of whooping- 
cough by internal administration of hydro- 
chlorate of Cocaine in doses varying from 
one-sixteenth grain in infants of eight months 
to one-third grain in children of five or six 
years. These doses were given three times 
in the twenty-four hours. The treatment 
had a very favorable effect on the symptoms 
and course of the disease; vomiting was 
checked, appetite returned, attacks of cough 
diminished both in frequency and in intensity, 
sleep became less disturbed, and the duration 
of illness was markedly lessened. Complete 
relief resulted in from a fortnight to three 
weeks. Cocaine is generally well borne by 
children. The only disagreeable effect is 
occasionally looseness of bowels, which is 
an advantage rather than otherwise. — British 
Medical Journal. 



Local Application of Carbolic Acid. — A dia- 
betic male had an insignificant wound of the 
leg dressed with a compress soaked in a weak 
Carbolic acid solution; this induced gangrene, 
which increased in size daily. The patient 
went to an empiric who replaced the carbolic 
acid by an ointment of some sort, when gan- 
grene was arrested. Another ease, an alco- 
holic, had sclerosis and perforating ulcer of 
the left great toe, which was dressed with 
Carbolic solution, one to forty; on the second 
morning all the end of the toe was gangren- 
ous. These cases show the dangers which 
may result from the local application of phe- 
nic acid, especially if made by the patient 
himself. Caution should always be exercised 
in the use of Carbolic dressing. The danger 
is greater when from any cause the tissues 
have less than their normal vitality. — Nv r- 
mandie Medicate. 



Contusions and Lacerations of Urethra. — 
Make careful attempts to introduce a cathe- 
ter, and if successful leave it in place for five 
or six days, irrigating the bladder daily with

pubic cystotomy may be resorted to. — D 
tor Rkimkim;, in Milwaukee Medical Jour- 
nal. 



Bleeding Hemorrhoids. — Order complete 
rest in horizontal position; bathe region with 
cold boracic lotion. If pain is acute, apply 
an ointment of vaselin in each ounce of which 
are two grains of muriate cocaine, five grains 
extract belladonna, and seven and a half 
grains extract krameria. If haemorrhage is 
severe, apply a solution of iron perchloride 
on cotton wool. Reduce haemorrhoids with 
sponge soaked in cold water. In the even- 
ing introduce a suppository containing one- 
fifth grain of extract belladonna, one-half 
grain of extract opium, fifteen grains of ex- 
tract krameria, and sixty grains of cacao 
butter. If haemorrhoids continue to cause 
annoyance, surgical interference either by 
forced dilatation of the sphincter or by ex- 
tirpation will be necessary. — Practitioner 
(London). 



To Prevent Decay of Teeth. — A very satis- 
factory mouth-wash is composed of: 

li Benzoic acid, 40 grains. 
Thymol, 4 grains. 
Salicylic acid, 20 grains. 
Tincture of eucalyptus, 3 drachms. 
Water, 25 ounces. 

The mouth should be rinsed thoroughly 
with the solution for half a minute each 
evening. It is efficacious in preventing de- 
composition of food particles, and conse- 
quently caries of the teeth. — Exchange. 

I We should think the application would be 
required at least twice or thrice daily. Fur- 
ther, Euthymol presents all the good features 
of the foregoing, and others as well, and is 
readily reduced to any strength desired. —

S instituted with benefit. With the ex- 
ception of the case that recovered within a 
week, the results of Quinine were neither re- 
markable or satisfactory, consequently par- 
ticular virtues in this malady cannot be 
attributed to this drug. The hypothesis that 
it acts by stimulating the inhibitory motor 
action of the spinal cord is not tenable. — 
Archives of Pediatrics. 



Hygienic Influence of Forests. — In warm 
countries, when a forest is cleared away. 
fever always makes its appearance, while if, 
in insalubrious districts, trees are planted in 
quantity, sickness disappears. Thus the 
Roman campagna and the Tuscan marshes, 
where luxuriant forests are now growing, 
have almost lost their traditional unhealth- 
fulness. 

Another important hygienic factor of the 
forest is the fact that ozone exists in un- 
usually large quantities in their neighbor- 
hood. This fact, lately established by Fer- 
now, has been held by him to show that a 
forest constitutes an important barrier against 
the approach of epidemics and infectious 
diseases. — Cosmos. 



New Method of Reducing Hernia. — Doctor 
Henry E. Stafford advises a method which is 
purely original. He takes an ordinary rubber 
bandage, two and a half inches wide and 
three yards long, and winds it about the scro- 
tum (including the penis), commencing below 
the centre and drawing tighter at the lowest 
part, until all parts are covered; thus the ban- 
dage exerts a constant pressure. With each 
layer the bandage is drawn tighter, and usu- 
ally before half of it is used up the bowel 
slips back and the hernia is reduced. This 
is not so painful as taxis, and is much more 
effective. The same method may be em- 
ployed in reducing a prolapsed rectum.— 
Maryland Medical Journal. 



Quinine in Chorea. — Recently, in the Boston 
Medical and Surgical Journal, were detailed 
eight cases of chorea treated with Quinine 



On Ether Narcosis. — Most cases of bron- 
chitis and broncho-pneumonia following the 
inhalation of ether are due to the nature and 
quality of the anaesthetic. It is an established 
fact that simple contact of air will cause a 
deterioration of the ether by the formation 
of certain products of oxydation which act 
as strong irritants of the respiratory mucous

membrane — an accident that may be avoided 
by keeping the ether in small containers in a 
cool place, and opening a fresh bottle for 
each operation. Any ether that is left over 
is always unfit for future purposes of inhala- 
tion, and can only be used externally. —The 
Australasian Medical Gazette. 



Belladonna in Pertussis. — Prepare solid 
extract by reducing to one-eighth strength 
with glycerin, making a convenient form for 
dispensing. Reduce again to put into the 
hands of patients, to an eighth, by adding 
seven drachms of syrup to one of this solu- 
tion of Belladonna. To a child of one year, 
begin by giving one drop three times a day 
for two days, then two drops three times a 
day for two days, and so on, constantly in- 
creasing until the whooping is overcome; 
then go back to the minimum dose, and con- 
tinue at that until the cough is entirely 
broken. — Medical Summary. 



Irrigation of the Bladder. — Doctor Baldy 
again calls attention to the great importance 
of this measure in all cystic troubles, either 
functional or otherwise, in women. A cath- 
eter, and small, hard-rubber funnel with rub- 
ber connection, is all the apparatus necessary. 
The general practitioner can daily irrigate 
the bladder of his female patients in his 
operating-chair without the slightest pain or 
inconvenience. The irrigator should be made 
aseptic, and the solution always used warm. 
Boric acid or potassium permanganate is 
amply sufficient. 

Taka-Diastase in Infant Feeding. — This 
ferment, being a dry powder, tasteless, and 
of no perceptible odor, can be given in very 
small bulk, and for this reason will prove 
| itself of value in infant feeding, where it is 
desirable to give starch-containing foods if 
such would easily dissolve and the infant's 
saliva could be relied upon to perform that 
function. The new diastase would appear 
to be the remedy for which we have waited 
so long. — New Orleans Medical and Surgical 
Journal. 



Vesicarea in Gonorrhoea. — I have for several 
months treated gonorrhoea with tincture of 
Vesicarea, and it has been a great comfort 
to my patients to have their cases entirely 
relieved within a week, and very often in 
three days. I depended alone upon the 
Vesicarea, hence make no error in attributing 
success to it. A half-teaspoonful to a tea- 



spoonful of the tincture three times a day 
will prove effectual in male or female. — 
Doctor Leo Bennett, in Medical Times. 



Operation for Ptosis. — Doctor Max Peschel, 
operating on a case of paralytic ptosis accom- 
panying total ophthalmoplegia, merely passed 
three slightly divergent threads beneath the 
skin, running on one side into the tarsal car- 
tilage and on the other stopping in the eye- 
brow, so as to utilize the action of the frontal 
muscle. The threads were left in place twenty- 
four hours, and the effect was very satisfac- 
tory. — Annates d'Oculistique. 



Pilocarpine in Alcoholism. — Doctor Josham 
recommends one-third grain doses of Pilo- 
carpine hypodermatically, and declares 'its 
sobering effects are remarkable;" sleep en- 
sues, and the patient wakes up a perfectly 
rational being. "The tense, red, bloated 
countenance and bleared, congested eyes 
pass away, the features become calm and 
easy, the skin soft and clear." — Provincial 
Medical Journal. 



Chronic Haemorrhoids. — Simple diet and 
open-air exercise — avoid constipation, riding, 
and bicycling. Bathe anal region well with 
cold water after each action of the bowels. 
Take for a short period, at intervals, with 
lunch and dinner, two pills, each containing 
one grain of extract witch hazel, four grains 
of extract capsicum, and honey sufficient to 
make a mass. — The Practitioner (London). 



Sanguinaria as an Emmenagogue. — In his 
"Dynamical Therapeutics" Professor H. T. 
Webster, who is known as a careful observer, 
remarks that Sanguinaria is apparently pos- 
sessed of valuable emmenagogue and ecbolic 
properties; he claims to have found it very 
reliable in amenorrhcea, but not suitable for 
indiscriminate use. — Western Druggist. 



Nuclein. — Nuclein therapy has come to 
stay. It is rational and scientific, and accom- 
plishes all the good that can come from so- 
called antitoxin, and its use is not fraught 
with any of the dangers of this latter remedy. 
— Hot Springs Medical Journal. 



Cold in the Head. — Gelsemium is the most 
potent drug known for the relief of this un- 
pleasant condition. If taken early, drop doses 
of the fluid extract administered hourly usu- 
ally secure most satisfactory results. — Medi-

smooth, and resembled in all respects that of 
the rest oi the perineum. The scrotum, how- 
ever, was noticed to be somewhat less rugous 
on the left side than on the right, and a iittle 
manipulation revealed the fact that the left 
e was absent. The right testicle was 
normal, and comparison showed an identity 
in size and consistence between it and the 
body in the perineum. Finally, the cord on 

eft side could be traced, somewhat in- 
distinctly, into the scrotum. There was, 
therefore, no doubt that the perineal tumor 

the testicle. 
There is a general consensus of opinion 
that perineal ectopia is the most uncommon 
deviation of the testis from its normal site. 
Curling, in his classical work published in 
enumerates only three examples, but 
many others have been since published. 

illy, as in the instance under notice, the 

ttion is on the left side, but in a case re- 
ported by J. Hutchinson it occurred on both 

. and iii another (Vidal's, still more 
remarkable) two brothers were similarly af- 
fected. It is usually congenital, but in one 
instance occurred, without the intervention 
of traumatism, so late as the age of twenty- 
five years. 

The exact causation is somewhat obscure, 
but it seems to be mainly due to an excessive 
development and abnormal persistence of 
those fibres of the gubernaculum testis which 
are attached to the tuber ischii and the 
sphincter ani, and which thus draw the testis 
further into the perineum than is usual. 
The band or adhesion, which is almost in- 
variably described as having been met with 
in operations on these cases, appears to con- 
sist of the remains of this process of the 
gubernaculum.

uns oi mi Sknsitivi Plant. — This, 
which is such a delicate house ornament with 
us, fairly enamels the earth in Ceylon, [ 
\ lid from Adam's Peak to Point de I 
multiplying its dainty, bell like pink blos- 
soms, mingled with the delicate, feathery 
acacia. Crowing so exposed and in v. 
like abundance, it is natural to suppose that 
it would become hardened, as it were, to 
rough usage; but this is not so, as it retains all 
its native properties, in exaggerated form if 
possible. Our puny little hot-house speci- 
mens are not more delicate or sensitive to 
the human touch than is this Ceylon mimosa. 
It is the most impressible of all known plants, 
and is appropriately named. Curious experi- 
ments prove this. If a person will fix his 
eyes upon a special branch and slowly ap- 
proach it, the plant is seen gradually to wilt 
and shrink within itself, as it were, before it 
is touched by the observer's hand. It is en- 
dowed with an inexplicable intelligence or 
instinct, and what appears to be a dread as 
regards rude contact with human beings. A 
few years since the writer was the guest of 
an English physician who was also a coffee- 
planter. While sitting with the family on 
the broad piazza which formed the front of 
the bungalow, a thrifty sensitive plant was 
recognized and made the subject of remark. 
The doctor called his daughter of elev- 
years from the house. " Lena," said he, "goB 
and kiss the mimosa." The child did - 
laughing gleefully, and came away. The 
plant gave no token of shrinking from con-J 
tact with the pretty child ! " Now," said our 
host, "will you touch the plant?" Rising 
to do so, I approached it with one ham 
tended, and before it had come fairly in 
tact the nearest spray and leaves wilted 
visibly. "The plant knows the child, 
the doctor, "but you are a stranger." It 
was a puzzling experience, which seemed to 
endow the mimosa with intelligence. — I'ln

K.ALA A/ \r. — The Englishman , of Calcutta, 
in a recent issue called attention to the in- 
creasing prevalence in Assam of a disease 
known as kala azar. At first regarded 
as a manifestation of malaria, then as a

form of beri-beri, it is now declared to be 
something quite different from these and a 
malady altogether peculiar to the district. It 
is described as decimating the population in 
many parts and leaving "behind it a perfect 
trail of desolation." We are informed that 
whereas in 1891 the total mortality from all 
causes amounted to 9 114, it had risen in 1893 
to 14,430, an increase apparently accounted 
for by the 5107 deaths from kala azar. The 
returns for 1894 have not been published, 
but it is anticipated that when they come out 
they will show a still further increase. In 
many tea gardens, notwithstanding the great 
efforts made to maintain good sanitary con- 
ditions, kala azar has carried off the coolies 
in large numbers; and at least five deaths 
have occurred at Nowgong from this cause 
in the European community. The malady is 
thus very fatal, and does not appear to be 
amenable to treatment; it surely claims its 
victims in from three to eighteen months. 

An attack is ushered in with continued 
fever, a very high temperature persisting 
usually for a fortnight or more, subsiding to 
recur at frequent intervals. Both spleen and 
liver undergo enlargement; diarrhoea and 
dysentery are frequent complications, dropsy 
is occasionally met with, and oedema of face 
and extremities is frequent. Anaemia is usually 
absent at the commencement of the attack, 
but becomes more or less pronounced as the 
case progresses. Extreme emaciation often 
accompanies the termination of the case, but 
the appetite, as a rule, remains good for 
many weeks during the progress of the dis- 
ease, notwithstanding that the patient is un- 
able to digest his food; and it is curious that, 
although the thermometer may register three 
or four degrees above normal, the patient 
thinks he has no fever; it is still more curious 
that the usual anti-malarial remedies seem to 
have absolutely no effect. 

An influential meeting of the medical men 
of the affected districts, summoned by the 
Sanitary Commissioner, has decided it is 
"absolutely imperative that an expert should 
be appointed to inquire into the pathology 
and cause of the disease." — British Medical 
Journal. 



A Possible Fallacy in Testing Urine 
for Sugar. — When a patient is taking medi- 
cinal doses of sulphonal it is always possible, 
by boiling the urine with Fehling's solution 
for a short time, to obtain a well marked pre- 
cipitate of a yellow color — namely, oxide of 
copper, — which, in the absence of proper pre- 
cautions, is apt to lead to erroneous conclu- 
sions. The same samples of urine, examined 



by the polari-saccharimeter with monochro- 
matic light (yellow sodium flame), will fail to 
give the deviation to the right which is char- 
acteristic of diabetic sugar — indeed, give the 
slightest appreciable deviation to the left. 

The reduction of Fehling's solution in this 
instance is not due to a product of transforma- 
tion of sulphonal in the animal econom 
the addition of a medicinal dose of sulphonal 
to urine absolutely free from sugar will pro- 
duce exactly the same reduction. — Glasgow 
Medical Journal. 



Emigra Intestinal Worms . 

ing Fevers. — Intestinal worms, particularly 
ascarides, if placed in water of 45° to 68° F., 
become stiff, curved, or coiled up, and insensi- 
tive to exfernal stimuli. If then the tempera- 
ture be elevated to 98.6 they begin to pre- 
sent slight movements, and if it be increased 
to 102 , 104 or 106 they become lively and 
energetic so that their motions seem to be 
rather a discharge of energy. These move- 
ments, though chiefly due to the high tem- 
perature, might also be aided by certain 
morbid processes, as typhoid fever, etc. This 
increased activity may cause them to tnr. 
intestinal ulcers or to pass into abscesses and 
thence be evacuated. A worm will not pene- 
trate normal intestinal wall, but if an opening 
present it will pass through. — Doctor De- 
mateis, in Gazzetta Medica di Torino. 



Height of the Fundus during the 
Stages of Labor. — Fothergill measured the 
breadth and length of the uterus, and the 
distance from the fundus uteri to the upper 
margin of the pubic joint, during the various 
stages of labor. The fundus rises three- 
tenths of an inch before labor ends, while 
the measurement from the fundus to the 
pubes lessens one inch before birth. The 
length of the parturient canal is not short- 
ened before delivery; as the child passes 
through the uterus into the vagina the \ 
grows narrow, while as labor advances the 
uterus is contracted antero-posteriorly. The 
cubic contents of the uterus are lessened. 
The fundus does not sink before the birth of 
the head. — Edinburgh Medical Journal. 



Cerebral I'r.tmia. — Two factors are to 
be considered: one an undoubted and domi- 
nating toxic element, due to faulty elimina- 
tion with diseased kidney; the other, cerebral 
oedema, the localization of which in the 
motor zones may give rise to convulsions,

Although cataract is not uncommon in the 
lower animals, operations for its successful 
removal are rarely reported. Cunier reports 
that both he and Brogniez (a veterinary sur- 
geon) have done successful operations upon 
horses and other lower animals. Randolph 
operated on a young pointer dog entirely 
blind from cataracts, by discission in both 
eyes. In three weeks the pupils were en-

there was extensive tubercular infiltration all 
around the lower jaw. — V ire how's Archiv. 



ORPTION BY THE RECTUM. — Posner has 
made some observations showing the rapidity 
of absorption of certain substances by the 
rectum. Certain solutions, like indigo-car- 
mine, methylene blue, etc., injected into the 
rectum, appear within fifteen minutes in the 



bile and urine; other substances, si:

chloroform remains limpid. — Medical Chron-

Influence or Climate on Menstrua- 
tion. — From a careful study, based upon 
over three thousand patients between the 
ages of ten and nineteen years, I have ar- 
rived at the conclusion that the reason why 
girls in tropical countries menstruate at a 
relatively earlier age than Europeans is not 
the influence of the climate, but of too early 
sexual excitement. — Jourert, in Indian Med- 
ical Gazette. 



1m ant Feeding. — In France this is regu- 
lated by very strict laws. A severe penalty 
is incurred by any one giving infants under 
one year any form of solid food unless such 
be ordered by a written prescription signed 
by a physician. Nurses are also forbidden 
to use nursing-bottles provided with rubber 
tubes in the feeding of infants. — Exchange. 



Prostatic Disease. — About the earliest 
symptom of prostatic disease is an increased 
frequency of urination, especially at night. 
This very often precedes any enlargement 
that can be discovered either by rectal exam- 
ination or by the use of the catheter. — Pacific 
Record of Medicine. 



The Spinal Cord. — Irritation of the spinal 
cord increases secretion. Congestion of the 
lumbar plexus or of the cord will cause dia- 
betes; a little lower down, diarrhoea. Con&lt; 
gestion of the cervical plexus causes vomiting 
and palpitation.

COLLES' FRACTURE. 

BY DOCTOR C. M. STOCKWELL. 

While making no claim to originality of 
investigation or methods of treatment, so 
deeply am I impressed with the importance 
of a correct comprehension of the true char- 
acter of this lesion and of the unfortunate 
results that usually follow, that I am led to 
present a brief synopsis of the literature 
covering the subject, along with the results 
of personal experience both in the usually 
accepted and a later method of treatment. 

It will, I doubt not, be conceded that no 
injury is so frequently met with that to the 
surgeon gives such unsatisfactory results: 
this is due in some measure to an incorrect 
aetiology. In no other fracture is there such 
marked tendency to stiffness of the joint and 
infiltration. In fact, it is not a fracture sim- 
ply, but a combined or rather conjoined 
fracture and dislocation — a fracture of the 
lower end of the radius, and dislocation of 
the ulnar-carpai articulation, with laceration 
of the investing and connecting ligaments. 
These last — the lacerations, — generally un- 
recognized, are a source of great irritation 
and necessarily lead to synovial inflamma- 
tion, effusion, and lymph deposits, that induce 
great suffering and ultimately permanent de- 
formity, to say nothing of the many instances 
in which they give rise to troublesome and 
unsatisfactory litigation. Text-books not 
alone fail to impress upon the student these 
facts, but for the most part sedulously ignore 
them. 

Frank Hastings Hamilton, though he rec- 
ognizes these possibilities as suggested by 
other writers, fails to appreciate their true 
import, and claims such conjoined disloca- 
tions and lacerations can only occur in cases 
that are produced by exceptionally severely 



applied force, predicating his opinion upon 
the fact that force, as applied to the cadaver 
in his experiments, failed to produce any 
such compound injury. Following Nelaton's 
suggestion and the actual experiments of 
Pilcher, he attempted the production of 
Colles' lesion upon the cadaver, by the fol- 
lowing method: Extreme extension of the 
hand upon the arm, with the palm of the 
hand fixed upon a firm unyielding surface, 
when, by severe blows upon the sawn-off 
upper ends of the radius and ulna, fracture 
of the former was effected without the com- 
plication of dislocation of the latter or tearing 
of carpal ligaments. Considering Hamilton's 
boasted familiarity with mechanical laws and 
their relations to the lines of force, it is in- 
deed amazing that he failed to recognize the 
vast difference between the terms of this ex- 
periment and the actual conditions attending 
a case of Colles' fracture in the living sub- 
ject. And when his experiments are com- 
pared with those of Edwin M. Moore, or 
even with those of Lewis Pilcher, they ap- 
pear still more faulty, revealing an utter lack 
of knowledge of the mechanico-anatomical 
relations of not alone the radius and ulna, 
but also of the wrist and hand. He gratui- 
tously assumes the lesion is the result of the 
radius being caught between two counter 
forces and giving way at its weakest point. 

In the experiments of Doctor Moore — sub- 
sequently verified by Pilcher and Jacobson — 
the arm of the cadaver was bound flat upon 
a table-top, its anterior surface downward, 
and a flat lever fastened to the palm whereby 
the hand was forcibly extended — that is, 
bent back upon the arm — until fracture of 
the radius followed, which result invariably 
induced displacement of the ulna and tearing 
of the ligaments, both duly announced by a 
distinct -snap and sudden relief of tension. 
This experiment in its modus operandi is as 
nearly as possible consonant with the applied

force that induce- i' fracture, and was 

ognized by Dupuytreo as long ago as 

I: s a re gnition, moreover, of the 

that there is another factor aside from 
mere force in the line of the shaft of the 
radius, viz., extension of the hand at the 
caipo - radial and ulnar articulation. 

And here it may he appropriate to remark 
there is a third prime factor in the production 
of this lesion, of which no account can be 
taken in any experiment or series of experi- 
ments, and which is the force compounded by 
the weight of the body and the velocity of the 
fall. Hamilton's contention regarding the 
force being exercised upon the radius alone, 
which consequently gives way at its weakest 
point, is untenable, for in Colles* fracture the 
force of impaction is to a great extent broken 
ere it reaches this bone; again, the lower end 
of the radius is especially devised and fitted 
for receiving and breaking shock when ap- 
plied in the direction of its long axis. 

Before proceeding further, it may be perti- 
nent to inquire what constitutes the lesion 
that bears the name of Abraham Colles, who 
taught surgery in Dublin more than eighty 
years ago. Hamilton insists it is a fracture 
of the radius one-fourth to three-fourths of 
an inch from its carpal articulation; but Mr. 
Colles distinctly defines it as occurring two 
inches from the latter point. In these days, 
however, the title by extension is made to do 
duty for fracture at any and all points be- 
tween these two extremes, induced by impac- 
tion through the wrist and hand, whereby is 
produced the well known "silver fork" de- 
formity. — Barton's fracture, which consists 
merely of a chipping-off of the posterior 
margin of the lower end of the bone, is 
consequently excluded. In other words, in 
spite of the conflicting expressions, Colles' 
lesion is a fracture of the lower end of the 
radius, complicated by dislocation of the head 
of the ulna and tearing of the investing liga- 
ments. This point being conceded, it is 
readily understood why the classical methods 
of treatment are so unsatisfactory; for in the 
added lesion of dislocated ulna and torn 
ligaments is found an injury of the synovial 
surfaces that in other instances— found in 
other parts of the body — teach us to- expect 
serious inflammation and disintegrating ac- 
tion. If measures are not adopted that will 



with certainty place these surfaces in norma! 
Condition, relieve irritation, and afifi I 
plete rest, unfavorable or even pernicious 
results must in all reason be expected. 

In [869 Doctor Edwin M. Moore, while 
Serving as Surgeon to St. Mary's Hospital, 
Rochester, New York, had eharge of a woman 
who in a paroxysm of insanity threw h&lt; 
from a third-story window, receiving so 
severe an injury of the spine as to cause 
death in less than thirty minutes. It was 
also observed that she had suffered fracture 
of both forearms — double Colles' fracture. 
Post-mortem examination of the right arm 
revealed the characteristic deformity, and 
further evidence was afforded by the fact 
that no crepitus resulted on rotation of hand. 
No impaction was apparent, but the lower 
fragment of the radius was found to ride the 
back of the upper; the ulna was also dis- 
covered to have been carried well downward 
and outward from the axis of the forearm. 
Having, as he supposed, pressed the frag- 
ments into place, Moore was surprised to 
find a resistance which seemed like muscular 
action. This being manifestly impossible, 
the cause was sought for "by repeating the 
effort to replace the broken fragment, with 
the result of recurrence of resistance, with 
an elastic rebound." Finally solution of the 
mystery was found in the peculiar position of 
the ulna, its luxation and ligamentous en- 
tanglement. The head of the ulna, though 
having no bony articulation, nevertheless 
does articulate w r ith the triangular fibro- 
cartilage, which serves the purposes of a 
ligament and is attached to the pit at the 
base of the styloid process upon which it 
rotates, and is itself covered with cartilage 
provided with synovial membrane. 

The annular ligament, being a portion of 
the fascia of the forearm, furnishes grooves 
through which the tendons of the extensor 
muscles pass; the posterior portion passing 
across over the head of the ulna is attached 
to the pisiform and cuneiform bones, while 
the anterior passes from the end and inner 
surface of the styloid process to the cunei- 
form. The ulnar extensor runs in one of the 
sheaths of this fascia before described, and 
takes a course between the styloid process 
and the bone upon the back or side of the 
forearm, and thereby furnishes no small

amount of support. The rebound — described 
by Moore as seeming at first like muscular 
action — was found to be due to the fact that 
a projection of the styloid process had been 
caught in the fibres of the annular ligament, 
by which the ulna was prevented from rising 
and the wrist forced back. Every ordinary 
method of replacing these bones was resorted 
to by Doctor Moore in this case. "The or- 
thodox plan of bending the hand toward the 
ulnar border of the forearm only resulted in 
tightening the annular band on the styloid 
hook, folding it upon itself, and no pressure 
on the anterior surface of the ulna could 
cause its liberation, but on the contrary in- 
sured its retention with greater certainty." 
"An incision through the annular ligament," 
Doctor Moore continues, " revealed the nature 
of the separation. The internal lateral liga- 
ment was torn away from its attachment to 
the styloid by separation of the scale of com- 
pact bony tissue comprising the head of the 
process and its inner surface, thus leaving 
the styloid as a rough, ragged hook to hold 
the annular ligament. The attachment of 
the triangular fibro-cartilage to the styloid 
was also torn off, but the rent was through 
the cartilage, leaving a few tags in the pit." 

It is this complete severance of a ligament- 
ous restraint which permits the ulna to bulge 
outward and downward; and when the hand 
is carried backward and upward the styloid 
hook is moved forward and held at the pisi- 
form bone by the annular ligament. If the 
ulnar extension, however, is carried toward 
the radial side, thereby the ulna is freed from 
the restraint of the annular ligament, and its 
head is moved toward the radius and through 
the rent in the fibro-cartilage resting against 
the wrist-joint, thus holding the hand out at 
full length, keeping the fractured ends of the 
radius in apposition, and furnishing the best 
of all splints — an entirely parallel bone in its 
place. The absence of crepitus may be ex- 
plained by the fact that the fractured sur- 
faces of the radius are not in contact — the 
lower fragment being carried up and onto 
the surface of the upper fragment. 

Moore's examination of the left arm in the 
case under consideration revealed an oblique 
fracture one-fourth of an inch on the palmar 
surface and three-fourths of an inch on the 
back, inclining toward the ulna. The posi- 



tion of the ulna was the same as in the right 
arm, only that a little more of the bony tissue 
of the styloid was torn away. The annular 
ligament was folded into a similar cord, 
causing a rebound whenever an attempt was 
made to carry the lower fragment of the 
radius into its normal place. — The only point 
of difference in the two fractures was in the 
exact line of the fracture — a difference which 
does not, apparently, in the least bear upon 
the question of reduction, or retention after 
reduction. 

Here I may mention the fact that Sir Astley 
Cooper, though he wrote at a time before this

peculiar lesion had received the baptismal 
title derived from the eminent Dublin sur- 
geon, appears to have almost stumbled upon 
its real aetiology; but never having had the 
privilege of post-mortem dissection, he was 
led astray by supposing the pronator quad- 
ratus muscle to be the adverse power. He as- 
sumed that fracture of the radius close to the 
wrist- joint entails dislocation of the ulna, and 
adds that "one must be very careful in its 
treatment in order to prevent the injury 
leading to permanent loss of the use of the 
fingers; for so soon as the injury happens, 
the pronator quadratus draws the fractured

point made by Doctor Moore, as will be seen 
later on. 

In attempting to prove that the fracture 
of the radius is the chief or only lesion, both 
Hamilton and Dennis — the last our latest 
author — mention the foregoing case of 
Moore's as one of exceptional severity, due 
to the great height from which the victim 
had fallen; yet Hamilton later admits the 
deformity of the lesion in question is due in 
a large majority of instances to a relaxation, 
stretching, or more or less disruption, of the 
anterior and posterior radio-ulnar ligaments, 
the triangular fibro-cartilage, and the inter- 
nal lateral ligaments, "to which," he says, "I 
feel satisfied we must add the influence of 
strong, unbroken and oblique fasciculae of 
the anterior carpal ligament." To this — 
without cognizance of any effect which in- 
jury of synovial membrane may have in the 
restoration of the integrity of the arm and 
hand —he attributes the deformity, which he 
also says "may be expected in a certain 
number of cases to continue, however exact 
and perfect may be the bony union." In- 
deed, though claiming that in his "own

practice, deformity alter this fracture is the 
exception," he declares when giving prog- 
that "in a pretty large proportion of 
- occurring in the practice of sin. 
whose patients have been brought under my 
notice, some slight or considerable deformity 
remains." 

In order more fully to comprehend the 
peculiar character of this fracture, it may be 
well to consider for a moment the manner in 
which the injury is received: 

In whatever direction the body is Inclined 
to fall, the hands are instinctively thrust out 
in such a manner that the first impact with 
earth— or whatever may be the object fallen 
upon — is upon the ball of the thumb, the 
hand being more or less rotated inward; 
hence the first brunt of the blow as com- 
municated to the radius is upon its outer 
border, and the second — after or during pro- 
cess of fracture — is caused by rotation upon 
the ulna and its investing and attached liga- 
ments. Therefore, whether the force be 
severe or otherwise, providing it be sufficient 
to induce fracture of the radius, it is equally 
likely to disrupt ulnar or carpal ligaments. 
If this complication does not occur, why 
should this be considered more than a simple 
fracture and prove unamenable to such gen- 
eral treatment as is accorded to any other 
fractures of long bones ? Why is it that good 
results are not even expected? 

Doctor Lewis S. Pilcher, of Brooklyn, N. Y.. 
in a paper read May 16th, 1878, before the 
New York Academy of Medicine, claims that 
the distinctive feature of this fracture is the 
tearing up of the periosteum— reinforced by 
fasciculi of the anterior ligament at or about 
that portion of the bone which is usually in- 
volved in this fracture — that so firmly holds 
the broken fragments in their changed con- 
dition as to require great force and careful 
manipulation to restore to normal. He, how- 
ever, admits the contention of Doctor Moore, 
that once restored to normal condition the 
fractured fragments are retained with very 
little difficulty and without resort to for- 
midable splint machinery. 

Having now endeavored to practically por- 
tray in some measure the varied influences that 
conspire to complicate this lesion, and that so 
frequently entail unfortunate results, I may

pass on to the varied methods of treatment 
suggested. 

Reduction of this fracture receives very- 
little attention from most writers, but an 
unlimited variety of splints to retain the 
fractured fragments in place are suggested. 
Nearly all advocate extension — some severe, 
others moderate, — with manipulation of the 
fragments by the fingers for the purpose of 
forcing them into apposition; and it is gen- 
erally deemed necessary to hold the parts 
firmly as replaced, until splints are fixed upon 
the arm, which latter are advised to be firmly 
held until fastened securely by bands or roller; 
also the splints are required to be so padded 
as to press upon the bones or portions of 
bones that before reduction were most promi- 
nent. 

Druitt, in directing treatment, offers the 
following advice: "The elbow being bent 
and steadied, the hand should be clasped and 
powerfully extended, and at the same time be 
somewhat adducted." Long splints, longer 
than the arm, and well padded, are to be 
employed, but should, he thinks, be removed 
after three weeks in order to permit passive 
motion. 

Gross, in speaking of reduction, says: 
" Having encircled the thumb and each finger 
with a narrow bandage, the better to control 
the resulting swelling, and the fracture having 
been adjusted by pressure and extension, a 
roller is next passed around the limb as high 
up as the superior part of the forearm." He 
then advocates application of the Bond splint. 
Erichsen recommends " forcible extension 
and counter-extension with a view of disen- 
tangling the fragments and 'removing the 
dorsal prominence, and the application of a 
pistol-shaped wooden splint along the outside 
of the arm, reaching from the elbow to the 
extremity of the fingers." 

Hamilton gives no method of reduction, 
but enters largely upon the description and 
application of a great variety of splints, com- 
mending most that of Hewett, which is pro- 
vided with a movable hand-piece that permits 
flexion and extension of the hand without 
disturbance of the splint itself. His second 
preference appears to be a combination of 
short splints applied both anteriorly and pos- 
teriorly, but extending only to the carpus, 
permitting slight movement of the carpal 



joint. He attempts a description of Moore's 
method, but comes very far short of making 
it comprehensible — indeed, gives conclu 
evidence that he does not himself understand 
it. He then declares that "reduction is to 
be accomplished by extension and partial 
circumduction, the hand being grasped firmly 
and extended first to the radial side, and 
finally forwards or in position of flexion." — 
Evidently he had no personal knowledge of 
the manipulation, or comprehension of the 
mechanical forces necessary to be overcome 
in order to secure reduction. 

Thomas Bryant makes no mention of 
methods of reduction, but contents himself 
with recommending the use of well padded 
splints extending down to the fingers and 
firmly fixed by strapping, broad bands, or a 
roller bandage. "The elbow," he says, 
"should be bent at right-angles, and the 
hand held midway between pronation and 
supination." After three weeks he would 
remove the splints and give freedom to the 
hand. He adds: "The wrist-joint rarely 
ever recovers its normal movements after 
this form of fracture. Such deformity per- 
manently remains, of which fact the patient 
should be warned." 

Dennis assures us that reduction is to be 
made by the surgeon "grasping the hand of 
the patient as if to shake hands, and then 
making forcible, continuous and gradual ex- 
tension so as to disengage the impaction and 
bring the lower fragment into apposition 
with the other." Fixation is to be maintained 
by splints, of which he mentions several 
different forms, giving preference to those so 
short as to reach only to the wrist. 

David W. Cheever, who certainly is the 
peer of any living surgeon, is by no means 
so sanguine as some of his contemporaries. 
He considers the fracture one of the most 
difficult to treat and get a perfect result; the 
most careful treatment, he says, will not in- 
sure against subsequent deformity. He ad- 
mits that one of the causes of imperfect 
restoration is that "the radio-ulnar ligaments, 
and also the lateral ligaments of the wrist- 
joint, are ruptured or stretched and strained 
at the time of the fracture so that the hand 
is partially dislocated at the wrist." With 
careful treatment, however, he thinks "a 
fair hand may be had in a majority of in-

stances, a per* 

ie, according to si; 
authorities, in other cases, in spite of any 
it." 

Here may be added that some recent sur- 
gical writers recommend the fixation of the 
•n and hand, as far as the metacarpo- 
phalangeal articulation, in a plaSter-qf-Paris 
bandage — a line of treatment also universally 
.mended by (ierman and French au- 
thors; hence one is not surprised to learn 
from both these sources that the "resulting 
deformity is often extreme, and ulceration, 
phlegmon and gangrene of the soft parts 
frequent." 

Bardenheur, dissatisfied with the plaster- 
of- Paris treatment, presents the astonishing 
alternative of confining the patient in bed, 
placing the hand and forearm on a support 
with an upward incline, the former project- 
ing upon the splint, and attached to a cord 
"which is carried under a pulley fixed to the 
bottom of the foot-board of the bed, then 
brought up over a second pulley at the top 
of the foot-board, the distal end being at- 
tached to a weight; the extension is con- 
trolled in such direction," the author says, 
"as to overcome the existing deformity." 
This contrivance, fairly mediaeval in ingenuity 
and inquisitorial in its fiendishness, like a 
deal of modern German pathology bears the 
ear-marks of a ponderous, clumsy theory that 
has never had practical elucidation. 

Moore's method, which commends itself as 
being both clear and rational, is likewise 
based upon the mechanism of the parts, and 
changes induced by production of the lesions 
as found by him in the dissections before 
alluded to. This is best given in detail as 
nearly as possible in his own words. He 
says : 

The patient may be anaesthetized or not. 
An assistant holding the forearm of the pa- 
tient, the surgeon grasps the hand of the 
latter, the left with the right, and vice versa. 
If now the other hand be placed under the 
forearm above the point of fracture, the 
operator is enabled to bring the thumb over 
the back of the ulna, when the fingers are 
made to embrace the radius. Traction is 
first made by extension; then draw the hand 
laterally to the radial side, then backward; 
now while holding backward, and while 
making extension, it is swung toward the 



ulnar side, bending well laterally, when the 
extension of the hand is changed foi fit 

— thus the act of circumduction describes 

nearly a semicircle. Th( n of the 

hand grasping the fort-arm undergoes con-

other hand in everything but the l 
As the backward position of the band, when 

I arried to the extreme ulnar side, is 
changed to flexion, the thumb of the SU1 
rolls around the border of the ulna, and is 
below when the manoeuvre is comp 
The test of the reduction is to be found by 
the presence of the head of the ulna on the 
radial side of the extensor. 

The head of the ulna rests mediately, 
through the triangular fibro-cartilag« 
the cuneiform bone, and is restrained from 
going backward by the annular ligament, 
holding on each side the tendons of the ex- 
tensor minimi digit i and the extensor carpi 
ulnaris, thus making a concavity corre&gt;. 
ing in form to a socket. When it is pn 
into its pocket, and the hand flexed so that 
the head is supported by the wrist, the posi- 
tion of the hand is also restored in its relation 
to the radius. As a result of the displace- 
ment of the ulna, the ulnar extensor is carried 
from its place above the styloid proct 
the opposite side of the ulna in an extreme 
displacement, though sometimes it remains 
above its centre — and it is this latter form 
of lesion wherein classical modes of treat- 
ment may secure some measure of success. 
To disentangle the styloid and swing the 
tendon of the ulnar extensor over into its 
place is the purpose of the manoeuvre just 
described. The hand is drawn toward the 
radius to pull off, by stretching, the annular 
ligament. 

The backward motion, accompanied by ex- 
tension, renders the ulnar extensor tense, 
which serves to draw the annular ligament 
backward — this is effected by pressing the 
thumb upon the ulna. The circumduction 
carries the tendon over the side. The fact 
that this injury entails a luxation as well as 
a fracture is further proved by the circum- 
stance that the restoration is accompanied 
with a snap both tangible and audible. 

When the manoeuvres described have been 
completed, as before remarked, the hand is 
flexed and the thumb of the operator rests 
on the under side of the ulna. The head of 
the latter appears on the back of the wrist, 
and corresponds in position and contour to its 
fellow of the opposite wrist, excepting always 
such swelling as may arise from effusion. 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 



As in the treatment of any other luxation, 
effort at reduction should not be abandoned 
until the deformity is entirely removed and 
the operator is assured that the ulnar exten- 
sor is in its place — a fact that can be easily 
determined. 

The dressing proposed is intended merely 
to hold the head of the ulna in its fascial 
socket, utilizing the weight of the hand to 
keep the luxation of the ulna reduced.— If 
the thumb of the operator is kept under the 
ulna after the reduction, it will quickly be 
discovered that the weight of the hand is 
sufficient to retain it in place.

Fig. 3. — Colles' fracture after reduction by Moore's 
method — pad in situ. 

As a substitute for the thumb, very little 
dressing is required, merely a cylindrical 
compress two inches in length and about half 
an inch in diameter— in fact, a single-headed 
roller bandage— which is placed under the 
ulna from the pisiform bone upward; this 
compress must also rest on the radial border 
against the tendon of Xht flexor carpi ulnar is. 
A band of adhesive plaster, of the same 
width as the bandage roll, and passing over 
the latter, is now wrapped firmly around 
the wrist, being made to extend downward 
to the extreme point of the radius, thus 
clasping the bones neatly and tightly. Note 
that, reduction having been accomplished, 
Nature has provided the best possible splint. 
The ulna lying beside the radius prevents 
displacement of the fractured end of the 



bone, and all that is required is to replace 
and secure this splint in its natural position. 
There is no pain in the after-treatment, 
a"nd such freedom from pain is evidence of 
complete reduction; if pain persists after 
treatment of Colles' fracture, the reduction 
is certain to be incomplete. After three or 
four weeks the dressing may be removed and 
the patient is in position to use with perfect 
freedom the injured extremity the same as 
prior to the accident. There is no occasion 
for inducing immobilization of hand or wrist, 
which only results in stiffness from non-use. 
When once the fracture is completely re- 
duced, displacement cannot again be repro- 
duced by any ordinary movement; and the

pad and adhesive strap, assisted by the 
position of the hand, secure all that can be 
desired. 

I may here lay especial emphasis upon the 
fact that the ordinary rule of loose dressing 
on the first visit to a fracture of this class is 
a grave error. The first aim and purpose of 
the surgeon is to bring all the parts into im- 
mediate close relation. The plaster dressing 
gives slightly; the compress is by no means 
rigid; hence both, having a tendency to yield, 
are unlikely to produce serious constriction 
of the blood-vessels, and swelling consequent 
thereupon; the patient may, however, be 
given permission to split the adhesive plaster 
on the dorsal surface of the wrist in about 
six hours if swelling demands; and it is per- 
haps advisable for the operator to do this

being prone and allowed to overhang, when 
by its own weight it secures the ulna in 
proper position — that is to say, the sling sup- 
ports the wrist through the compress, the 
wrist resting on the ulnar side; and yet this 
is not essential except when the swelling is 
considerable, which rarely persists more than 
a few days. 

Regarding passive motion, upon which 
considerable stress appears always to be laid 
— this, as already intimated, is self-insured, 
since perfect freedom is accorded to the hand 
and its controlling muscles; consequently 
there is no tendency to anchylosis or ad- 
hesion of the tendons to their sheaths, results 
which produce the deformity most frequently 
met with and apprehended after this injury. 
While writers with great unanimity advise 
early resort to passive force, they one and all 
appear to ignore a fact which experience 
readily teaches— that early forcible passive 
motion aggravates synovial irritation, and in 
cases of advanced age especially tends to the 
perpetuation of the deformity which it is de- 
sired to avoid. 

During a"n active and somewhat diversified 
professional career of more than forty years, 



it has been my fortune to encounter a con- 
siderable number of cases oi s' fracture, 

and in varied ages and conditions of life, and 
likewifl serve numbers under the care 

of immediate professional friends. During 
the first half of this period the results were 
more or less unsatisfactory, according to the 
degree of the lesion, and ranged from partial 
anchylosis to wasting and loss of muscular 
power in the forearm with adhesions of ten- 
dons to their investing sheaths. The methods 
of treatment, too, were widely varied; every 
form of splint was carefully and hopefully 
tried, but with no accession of better results. 
But with a knowledge of anatomical changes 
and methods of adjustment, as suggested by 
Doctor Moore, and so fully attested in his 
autopsies — admirably explained in his paper 
before the New York Medical Society in 
1870 — success has not only been invariable, 
but most flattering. It is with no little de- 
gree of pride, therefore, that I am able to 
assert the results during the last half of my 
professional career have been doubly satis- 
factory — satisfactory to the operator in reliev- 
ing him of all fears as to the litigation that 
is so frequent a sequel to treatment of this 
lesion (said to occur in about eighty per cent, 
of cases); satisfactory to the patient in that 
he is saved all suffering, and obtains a per- 
fect wrist. By following this method of treat- 
ment, Colles' fracture is no longer a bite noire; 
and yet to-day one is continually brought in 
contact with deformities resultant upon this 
lesion, and so invariably as to lead to the be- 
lief that when authors admit, as they all do, 
that successful results as a rule are only par- 
tial, this utterance is but a half-truth, and 
arises from the pride which disinclines every 
man to admit that any procedure on his part 
is always a failure; and I believe it would not 
be saying too much if I were to add that a 
large number of the admitted partial failures 
are in fact total failures. Indeed, no less an 
authority than the late Henry Bigelow of 
Boston, who was admittedly without a supe- 
rior on this continent in the domain of sur- 
gery, was wont to admit that Colles' fracture, 
when complete, under the old orthodox 
methods of treatment resulted invariably in 
more or less deformity.

OUTLINES OF SANITARY ORGANIZATION 

OF SOME OF THE GREAT ARMIES 

OF THE WORLD.* 

BY MAJOR JOHN VAN RENSSELAER HOFF, SUR- 
GEON U. S ARMY. 

{Continued from page 6j6.) 

RESUME OF THE SANITARY ORGANIZATION OF 
THE BRITISH ARMY.f 

The officers of the Army Medical Staff 
comprise one Director-General (who is a sur- 
geon-major-general with a special rate of 
pay), ten surgeon-major-generals, twenty-four 
surgeon-colonels, and fifty brigade-surgeon- 
lieutenant-colonels. There is no fixed estab- 
lishment for the remaining ranks of medical 
officers, whose titles are surgeon- major, sur- 
geon-captain, and surgeon-lieutenant. In 1893 
these grades numbered 803 officers, count- 
ing three with the Army headquarters staff. 
There are also generally a number of sur- 
geon- lieutenants^ on probation (twelve in 
1893), two apothecaries who rank with cap- 
tains, and thirty-five quartermasters who are 
store keepers and accountants and have the 
rank of captain or lieutenant. 

The Director-General is a member of the 
headquarters staff of the Army, and is, under 
the commander-in-chief, the responsible head 
of the department; he is charged with the 
administration and command of the army 
medical staff and medical staff corps; also of 
the militia medical staff and corps, the militia 
reserve of the medical staff corps, and the 
medical establishments of the Army, including 
the Army medical reserve of officers, besides 
the volunteer medical staff and corps, and 
the nursing service. 

The surgeon-major-generals and surgeon- 
colonels act as principal medical officers in 
charge of the medical administration of dis- 
tricts and commands. There is at present 
one surgeon-major-general in the office of the 
Director- General. Of the other nine, six are 
serving at home and three in India. 

In certain small districts brigade-surgeon- 
lieutenant-colonels have charge as senior 
medical officers.

geons.

The remaining medical officers perform 
the executive duties at all stations at home 
or abroad. 

Hospitals. — The system of hospitals in- 
cludes: General hospitals, station hospitals, 
hospitals on board ship, lunatic hospitals, 
and hospitals for women and children. Of 
these the only ones that require special notice 
in this connection are the station or garrison 
hospitals and the hospitals for women and 
children. 

Station hospitals are commanded by medi- 
cal officers appointed by the Director-Gen- 
eral, usually a surgeon-lieutenant-colonel or 
surgeon major, subject to the general officer 
or other officer in command of the troops at 
the station. An establishment of officers of 
the medical staff, and warrant officers, non- 
commissioned officers and men of the medical 
staff corps, is provided for each hospital ac- 
cording to its requirements. 

Hospitals for soldiers' wives and children 
are administered as station hospitals. They 
are only partially supported by the govern- 
ment, deriving part of their funds, etc., from 
philanthropic societies and funds raised by 
voluntary contributions. 

Hospitals for wives and children of soldiers 
are provided with a staff of female atten- 
dants. Orderlies or messengers for these 
hospitals are detailed from the troops on 
duty at the station. 

The Medical Staff Corps.— The establish- 
ment of this corps provided for in the last 
army estimates was thirty-eight warrant offi- 
cers, 342 staff-sergeants and sergeants, 2S7 
corporals, nine buglers, and 1788 privates; 
total, 2464. This force is organized in com- 
panies, of which one is posted to each district, 
and with its corresponding company of vol- 
unteer medical staff corps attached. The 
Medical Staff Corps goes on foreign service, 
though not to India as yet. The last "An- 
nual Return of the British Army " gives 
twenty-one of these companies. The war- 
rant and non-commissioned officers and men 
of the Medical Staff Corps are under the 
command of the officers of the army medical 
staff. 

Though the Medical Staff Corps furnishes 
hospital attendants for all duties, yet medical 
officers may detail convalescents for such 
duties as they are capable of performing. 






THE MEDICAL AGE. 



Soldiers from other units than the Medical 
Staff Corps are often detailed in lieu of or to 
supplement the establishment of hospital at- 
tendants. These are known as regimental 
hospital orderlies, and get extra pay. 

Strctchn -B(\iros.— In every military unit, 
at least four men per squadron, or two men 
per company, will be trained as the stretcher- 
bearers of the corps. When an action is 
about to begin, the trained regimental bear- 
ers, with the field stretchers, will be placed 
at the disposal of the medical officer attached 
to the unit. 

Nursing Service. — The nursing service is 
divided into three grades: Lady superinten- 
dents; senior nursing sisters (or acting lady 
superintendents); nursing sisters. Nursing 
sisters are retired on pension after the age of 
sixty years. If disabled in service before that 
age, the amount of pension or gratuity is reg- 
ulated by their length of service. They are 
rationed and allowed a uniform free of all 
expense, and have certain allowances. They 
are under strict discipline, and the lady super- 
intendent is responsible to the principal med- 
ical officer that their work is properly done, 
etc. Nursing sisters serve abroad, being de- 
tailed for foreign service by the Director- 
General. 

The lines of medical assistance in the field 
in active service, traced from front to rear of 
an army, are: 

Medical Officers attached to units (with 
their company bearers); 

Bearer Companies: 

Field Hospitals: 

Hospitals on the lines of communication: 

General Hospitals at the base. 

The British Army, or portions of it, may 
be mobilized either for service abroad or for 
home defense. The two states of mobiliza- 
tion vary considerably, especially in the sani- 
tary and medical services. 

For service abroad each army corps has 
six bearer companies and ten field hospitals; 
for home defense, six bearer companies and 
three field hospitals. Each army corps for 
service abroad has one principal medical 
officer, two surgeon-major assistants, and one 
orderly medical officer. Each infantry divi- 
sion and each cavalry division has its own 
principal medical officer and one surgeon- 
major assistant. Each infantry battalion of 



eight compan wt\\ as each cavalri 

regiment, has one medical officer; the 

artillery, two; each field or horse artillery 
division, one. 

Bach of the six infantry brigades of a corps 
has one bearer company and one field hos- 
pital. 

Each of the three infantry divisions of a 
corps, and also each corps as such, has one 
field hospital. 

The organization of the medical units 
(bearer companies and field hospitals) for 
service abroad, is as follows:

Total, all ranks 41 26 

With the exception of those at Aldershot and 
Netley, bearer companies and field hospitals 
are not permanent establishments, being only 
formed on mobilization, etc. When organ- 
ized they are under command of a medical 
officer. 

Field hospitals are organized and con- 
ducted as laid down in the Regulations for 
Medical Services. They have a light equip- 
ment to enable them to be moved with the 
troops. 

Hospitals on the lines of communication 
have a heavier equipment than field hospi- 
tals. They are established in such places 
and in such numbers on the lines of commu- 
nication as may be necessary. 

General hospitals at the base of operations 
will be fully equipped; a military depot will 
be attached to such hospitals.

Mobilization for Home Defense. — The num- 
ber of staff and regimental medical officers 
for duty in the first line is practically the 
same for home as abroad. The organization 
of the medical units (bearer companies and 
field hospitals) is practically the same also, 
except that the transport attached is consid- 
erably diminished. The number of bearer 
companies and the distribution thereof are the 
same as given for service abroad, but the field 
hospitals are reduced to three, and only one 
is allowed to each infantry division. Cavalry 
divisions are not organized for home defense, 
and for each cavalry brigade one bearer com- 
pany and a half-share in a field hospital are 
allowed. 

VIII. THE ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES. 

The war of the American Revolution, 
fought as it was for the most part by raw 
levies from the people — destitute of every 
material thing, even arms and ammunition — 
added little to the advancement of military 
sanitation. The Medical Department was, as 
a rule, poorly officered and badly equipped, 
and the sick were crowded into wretched 
huts or makeshift hospitals. Such organiza- 
tion as existed was borrowed from the British; 
there was no system of supplies or transport, 
and the ill and injured were very little better 
cared for than those of the Middle Ages who 
were "abandoned to crawl mayhap to the 
shelter of a monastery, or to die by the way- 
side." 

The war of 1812 again found this country 
without sanitary organization. The lessons 
taught by the wars of the Directory and 
Empire, in which Percy and Larrey gained 
such distinction, had apparently made little 
or no impression upon the American profes- 
sion, for the Sanitary Department was prac- 
tically where the War of the Revolution had 
left it. 

From a history of the Medical Department 
of the United States Army we learn that dur- 
ing this war general hospitals were established 
at various places on our northern frontier, as 
at Watertown, Albany, Malone, Buffalo, etc. 
I quote a single experience: 

In September, 181 1, the sick in hospital at 
Plattsburg, numbering 720, were, in view of 
the approaching fight, transferred to Crab 
Island. No accommodation had been pro- 



vided for them on the Island, and they re- 
mained for three days exposed to the wet 
and cold, when Doctor Powell determined to 
transport them to Burlington, which he did 
in open bateaux across the lake. This 
crowded the hospital at Burlington to such 
an extent that the ill-effects of crowd-poison- 
ing were soon perceived in the increased 
number of deaths and in the slow convales- 
cence of the many. Typhus, dysentery and 
diarrhoea became prevalent. 

As to what systematic provision was made 
for the transport of the wounded, and the 
various other details of sanitary organization 
so essential to an army, history is silent, and 
we can but infer that what was done in this 
direction was the outcome of each emergency 
as it arose. 

During the war with Mexico we started 
out with a regimental hospital organization 
similar to that of the British Army during 
the Peninsula campaign of almost fifty years 
before. There were no men regularly trained 
to care for the sick, or to assist the medical 
officers in their care, the only plan being for 
a certain proportion of men from the ranks 
to be detailed for this service as the occasion 
demanded. The advantages of the French 
system had not yet impressed themselves 
upon our medico-military organization. To 
be sure, we had also base or general hospitals 
to receive the overflow, and our sick were 
generally well cared for — the number at no 
time being excessive; but the good work ac- 
complished was not because of our system, 
but in spite of it. 

After the conclusion of this war, while 
there was an appreciable advance in the 
quality of the personnel of the Medical De- 
partment, there is no evidence that any par- 
ticular effort was made to perfect the sanitary 
organization of the Army; it remained as it 
had been from the beginning, without any 
such. 

At the outbreak of the War of Secession 
the regular army numbered* 1117 commis- 
sioned officers and 11,907 enlisted men. The 
Medical Department was composed of one 
Surgeon-General with the rank of colonel, 
thirty surgeons with the rank of major, and 
eighty-four assistant surgeons holding for the

tory of the War of the Rebellion, and other sources.

duty wherever their services were needed. 
ad demonstrated this system to 
be the best for the necessities of an army 
widely scattered over an immense area of 
territory, serving in commands of less than 
regimental strength, while it possessed the 
advantage of increasing the efficiency and 
value of the medical force from a profes- 
sional point of view. 

At the beginning of hostilities in 1861, 
large forces of State troops, or militia, re- 
sponded to the several proclamations of the 
President calling for aid in suppressing the 
rebellion. Each regiment was provided with 
a surgeon and an assistant-surgeon, commis- 
sioned by the State in which the troops had 
been enlisted. These officers were borne on 
the muster-rolls and permanently attached to 
the regimental organization, being seldom 
detached except for urgent reasons. 

During the early military operations, the 
administrative duties pertaining to the Medi- 
cal Department were performed by officers of 
the regular medical staff, detailed for the 
purpose, or by volunteer surgeons appointed 
as medical directors of divisions, as allowed 
by the President's proclamation of May 3d, 
1S61. 

On the 22d of July, 1861, Congress passed 
an Act authorizing the President to raise a 
force of volunteers, not exceeding 500,000, 
and prescribing the organization of this levy 
into divisions of three or more brigades, and 
that "each brigade shall be composed of five 
or more regiments, and shall have one briga- 
dier-general, two aids-de-camp, one assistant 
adjutant-general with the rank of captain, one 
surgeon, one assistant-quartermaster, and one 
commissary of subsistence." The surgeons 
authorized by this Act were known as brigade 
surgeons, and were borne as such on the offi- 
cial army registers of September, 1861, and 
January, 1862; they held the rank of major. 

The condition of affairs that obtained about 
the time of the enactment of this law was 
graphically described in a report of Surgeon 



Charles H. Triple:. I S A., the first m&lt; 
director of the Army of the Potomac, and 
one of the most distinguished officers of the 
Medical Department I U 

I joined the Army of the Potoma 
1 2th. 1X61, and was immediately charge 
the organization of the Medical Department; 

. . . The Army was encamped on the south 
side of the Potomac, covering an extent of 
some miles from Arlington Heights to A.&lt; 
dria, several miles down the river, and in and 
about Washington. There were some five 
or six hotels, seminaries, and infirmaries in 
Washington and Georgetown, occupied as 
general hospitals under capable officers, but 
with no system with reference to the admission 
and discharge of patients. Kvery regimental 
surgeon sent what patients he pleased to the 
general hospitals, without knowing whether 
there was any room for them or not, and 
men were discharged from hospitals with no 
means provided to insure their return to their 
regiments. It was not an unusual circum- 
stance for sick men to pass the night in the 
ambulance, wandering about the streets from 
hospital to hospital seeking admission. I 
could find no information anywhere as to what 
regiments were present, or whether they had 
medical officers or not. . . . The regu- 
lations of the Army recognized only regimen- 
tal and general hospitals. The regimental 
hospitals in the field were established in tents 
or in such buildings as might chance to be 
within the limits or immediate vicinity of each 
camp. The general hospitals available for 
the Army of the Potomac were the few old 
hotels or similar buildings occupied as hospi- 
tals in Washington. Alexandria, and Annapo- 
lis. There was no authority for any hospital 
establishment in the vicinity of the division 
or brigade that might relieve the regimental 
hospital tents. . . . The buildings already 
provided and occupied were seen at once to be 
totally inadequate. The entire hospital es- 
tablishment in the above-named cities con- 
tained only 2700 beds. 

Commenting upon this, Colonel Irwin 
(Medical Department U. S. A.) writes: 

Such were the first meagre attempts to ■ 
provide hospital accommodations for the 
invalids of an army numbering 140,000 to 
180,000 men preparing for active service in 
the field ! In further illustration of the dis- 
appointment caused in the public mind, and 
the confusion resulting from the absence of 
an adequate system of hospital organization 
to meet the demands of the vast numbers of 
military invalids suddenly thrown upon the

hands of the medical service, the words of 
Surgeon Tripler will convey some faint idea 
of the annoyance and unlooked-for interfer- 
ence that handicapped the Medical Depart- 
ment in the discharge of its onerous duties; 
he wrote: "I may mention here that a great 
deal of presumptuous intermeddling with the 
Medical Department of the Army occurred 
from time to time. Sensational preachers, 
village doctors, and strong-minded women, 
suddenly smitten with a more intricate knowl- 
edge and thorough perception of the duties 
and the administration of the medical depart- 
ment of an army, than I had been able to ac- 
quire in more than thirty years' experience 
and study, obtruded their crude suggestions, 
and marring where they could not make, and 
paralyzing when they attempted to quicken, 
succeeded by their uninformed zeal, inno- 
cently enough perhaps, but not the less un- 
fortunately on that account, in defeating 
measures I had much at heart, had carefully 
contemplated, and intended to carry into 
effect at the proper time." 

The duties, prerogatives and responsibili- 
ties of brigade surgeons being somewhat 
vaguely defined, the following bill was passed 
by Congress on July 2d, 1862: 

From and after the passage of this Act, brigade 
surgeons shall be known and designated as Sur- 
geons of Volunteers, and shall be attached to the 
general medical staff under the direction of the 
Surgeon-General; and hereafter such appointments 
for the medical service of the Army shall be ap- 
pointed surgeons of volunteers. 

The brigade surgeons, or Surgeons of Vol- 
unteers as they were henceforth called, were 
assimilated to those of the regular staff, 
holding equal rank with the latter under 
commissions conferred by the President and 
confirmed by the Senate. They became eli- 
gible to all the duties and prerogatives per- 
taining to the medical officers of the Army, 
whether in the field as directors of armies, 
corps, or departments, or in charge of hospi- 
tals, etc. From time to time, by Acts of 
Congress, additions were made to the regular 
and volunteer corps, and such changes ef- 
fected as were necessarily demanded. The 
Act of April 16th, 1862, was one of the most 
important of these, wherein the rank of briga- 
dier-general was conferred upon the Surgeon- 
General. Provisions were also made in this 
Act for an assistant surgeon-general and a 
medical inspector-general — both with the 
rank, pay, and emoluments of colonel of cav- 
alry, — and for eight medical inspectors, with 



the rank, pay, and emoluments of lieutenant- 
colonel of cavalry; also for medical purvey- 
ors and medical cadets. 

The text of the law is here inserted: 

An Act to reorganize and increase the efficiency of the 
Medical Department of the Army. 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Repre- 
sentatives of the United States of America in Con- 
gress assembled: That there shall be added to the 
present medical corps of the Army, ten surgeons 
and ten assistant-surgeons, to be promoted and ap- 
pointed under existing laws; twenty medical cadets, 
and as many hospital stewards as the Surgeon- 
General may consider necessary for the public ser- 
vice, and that their pay and that of all hospital 
stewards in the volunteer as well as the regular 
service shall be thirty dollars per month, to be 
computed from the passage of this Act. And all 
medical cadets in the service shall, in addition to 
their pay, receive one ration per day, either in kind 
or commutation. 

Sec. 2. — And be it further enacted: That the 
surgeon-general to be appointed under this Act 
shall have the rank, pay and emoluments of a 
brigadier-general. 

There shall be one assistant surgeon-general, 
and one medical inspector-general of hospitals, 
each with the rank, pay and emoluments of a colo- 
nel of cavalry; and a medical inspector-general 
shall have, under the direction of the Surgeon- 
General, the supervision of ali that relates to the 
sanitary condition of the Army, whether in trans- 
ports, quarters, or camps, and of the hygiene, 
police, and discipline and efficiency of field and 
general hospitals, under such regulations as may 
hereafter be established. 

Sec. 3. — And be it further enacted: That there 
shall be eight medical inspectors, with the rank, 
pay and emoluments each of a lieutenant-colonel 
of cavalry, and who shall be charged with the duty 
of inspecting the sanitary condition of transports, 
quarters and camps of field and general hospitals, 
and who shall report to the Medical Inspector- 
General, under such regulations as may hereafter 
be established, all circumstances relating to the 
sanitary condition and wants of troops and of hos- 
pitals, and to the skill, efficiency, and good conduct 
of the officers and attendants connected with the 
Medical Department. 

Sec. 4. — And be it further enacted: That the 
Surgeon-General, the Assistant Surgeon-General. 
Medical Inspector-General, and medical inspectors, 
shall, immediately after the passage of this Act, be 
appointed by the President, by and with the advice 
and consent of the Senate, by selection from the 
medical corps of the Army, or from the surgeons in 
the volunteer service, without regard to their rank 
when so selected, but with sole regard to qualifica- 
tions. 

Sec. 5. — And be it further enacted: That medical 
purveyors shall be charged, under the direction of 
the Surgeon-General, with the selection and pur- 
chase of all medical supplies, including new stand- 
ard preparations, and of all books, instruments, 
hospital stores, furniture, and other articles re- 
quired for the sick and wounded of the Army. In 
all cases of emergency they may provide such addi- 
tional accommodations for the sick and wounded 
of the Army, and may transport such medical sup- 
plies, as circumstances may render necessary, under 
such regulations as may hereafter be established, 
and shall make prompt and immediate issues upon

Ap; I 

Besides the medical officers of the regular 
and volunteer staff, and the medical officers 
of regiments, there was a class designated as 
Acting Assistant Surgeons, who were private 
physicians, uncommissioned, serving under 
contract to do duty with the forces in the 
field or in general hospitals. This class was 
very large, and embraced in its number some 
of the most eminent surgeons and physicians 
of the country. The medical cadets were 
generally young men, students of medicine, 
who were assigned to duty in general hospi- 
tals as dressers and assistants. 

The Medical Department was still further 
increased by a number of hospital stewards, 
who were enlisted as needed, and who per- 
formed the duties of druggists, clerks, and 
storekeepers. 

During the years of the war the organiza- 
tion of the regular staff had been increased 
so as to number one Surgeon-General, one 
Assistant Surgeon-General, one Medical In- 
spector-General, sixteen medical inspectors, 
and 170 surgeons and assistant-surgeons; 
there had been appointed 547 surgeons and 
assistant-surgeons of volunteers; there were 
mustered into service between April, 1861, 
and the close of the war, 2109 regimental sur- 
geons and 3882 regimental assistant-surgeons. 
During the same period there were employed 
eighty-five acting staff surgeons and 5532 
acting assistant-surgeons. 

To the fidelity and efficiency of this vast 
body of professional men the Surgeon-General, 



in his annual report of 1865, bears the follow- 
ing well deserved tribute: 

1 de.sirc to bear testimony to the ability, 
Courage, and zeal manifested throughout the 

war by the officers of the Medical Depart* 

ment, under all circumstances and upon all 
&gt;11S. With hardly an exception, they 
have been actuated by the highest motives of 
national and professional pride, and the num- 
ber who have been killed or wounded bears 
honorable testimony to their devotion and 
duty on the field of battle. 

The following record of casualties of the 
regular and volunteer staff during the war 
shows well for the honor of those who are 
erroneously supposed to escape the dangers 
and chances of war: 

Thirty-two were killed in battle, or by 
guerillas or partisans, and nine by accidents; 
eighty-three were wounded in action, of 
whom ten died; four died in rebel prisons, 
seven of yellow fever, three of cholera, and 
271 of other diseases, most of which were 
incidental to camp life or the result of ex- 
posure in the field. 

Of the amount of labor performed by the 
medical staff during the war, some idea may 
be obtained when it is stated that 5,825,480 
cases of wounds and diseases occurred among 
the white troops, and 629,354 cases among 
the colored troops. 

The cost of maintaining the Medical De- 
partment formed no small portion of the 
total expenses of the war, and it is a matter 
of just pride that it can be said that the 
medical disbursing officers performed their 
duties faithfully and honestly, and that the 
immense quantities of medical supplies dis- 
tributed all over the country were almost 
without exception properly accounted for. 
The expenditures on behalf of the Medical 
Department to the close of each fiscal war, 
on the 30th of June, from 1861 to 1866, were 
as follows:

Making a total of $47,351,982.24, expended 
during the war (exclusive of salaries of com- 
missioned officers) for the benefit of the sick 
and wounded soldiers of the nation. 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 






After the organization of the forces raised 
for the suppression of the rebellion was per- 
fected, the medical service in the field was 
based upon an independent hospital and am- 
bulance establishment for each division of 
three brigades. The personnel of the division 
hospital consisted of a surgeon in charge, 
with an assistant surgeon as executive officer, 
and a second assistant-surgeon as recorder; 
an operating staff of three surgeons aided by 
three assistant-surgeons, and the requisite 
number of nurses and attendants. The divi- 
sion ambulance train was commanded by a 
first lieutenant of the line, assisted by a 
second lieutenant for each brigade. The 
enlisted men detailed for ambulance duty 
were: A sergeant for each regiment, three 
privates for each ambulance, and one private 
for each wagon. The ambulance train con- 
sisted of from one to three ambulances for 
each regiment, squadron, or battery, a medi- 
cine wagon for each brigade, and two or 
more supply wagons. The hospital and am- 
bulance trains were under the control of the 
surgeon-in-chief of the division. The divi- 
sion hospitals were usually located just out 
of range of artillery fire. Sometimes three 
or more division hospitals were consolidated 
under the orders of a corps medical director, 
who was assisted by his medical inspector, 
quartermaster, commissary, and chief ambu- 
lance officer. 

The medical officers not employed at field 
hospitals accompanied their regiments and 
established temporary depots as near as prac- 
ticable to the line of battle. 

As soon as possible after every engage- 
ment, the wounded were transferred from 
the division or corps hospitals to the base 
or general hospitals, which at one time num- 
bered 205; these were under the charge and 
command of the regular or volunteer staff, 
assisted by acting assistant-surgeons, medical 
cadets, and officers of the second battalion 
of the veteran reserve corps. 

Ambulance Corps.— The necessity for a 
drilled and instructed corps for the transpor- 
tation of wounded from the field is apparent to 
every one who will consider the subject. The 
importance of having the wounded rapidly 
removed from the scene of strife must be 
conceded, not only on the score of humanity, 
but also as a military necessity. Without a 



detachment whose duty it is to attend to 
this service, the natural impulse of sympathy 
will draw men from the ranks to assist their 
fallen comrades, while the pretext is a temp- 
tation to the faint-hearted to shirk the perils 
of their position. Moreover, the courage of 
troops under fire would be sustained if they 
were assured that reliable men would be 
ready to bear them rapidly from the vicissi- 
tudes of conflict and to tender them early 
assistance. No organized ambulance corps 
existed in the Army at the beginning of the 
war, but the necessity of such an organization, 
under the control of the Medical Department, 
was early recognized by the medical officers, 
and already in April, 1862, Medical-Director 
Tripler, of the Army of the Potomac, called 
attention to the absolute necessity of having 
an experienced quartermaster and assistant 
commissary of subsistence attached to the 
command of the chief medical officer of an 
army in the field. He wrote: 

I find it impossible to secure either trans- 
portation or subsistence for the men thrown 
upon my hands, without tedious delays and 
much unnecessary suffering. Tune, which is 
so valuable to me now, is taken up and 
wasted in endeavors, too often unsuccessful, 
to get together ambulances and wagons, to 
have these trains properly and economically 
conducted, to have boats prepared and in 
position, to procure buildings for hospitals, 
to get subsistence for the sick and wounded, 
and, in short, doing the duty assigned to 
quartermasters and subsistence officers. It 
seems to me that to bring this evil to the 
notice of the Secretary of War will be 
sufficient to cause its instant remedy; at all 
events, I protest beforehand against the 
Medical Department being held responsible 
for evils they have no possible means of 
obviating. My experience in this campaign 
has taught me that without an executive 
officer of these two important departments 
under my command, more time is lost in 
negotiating through second and third parties, 
with an even chance of not getting at all 
what is wanted, and a certainty of not getting 
it in time, than would be required in procur- 
ing what is necessary and having it in the 
right place if these officers were placed at 
my disposal. 

On August 21st, 1862, Surgeon-General 
W. A. Hammond, U. S. Army, in a letter to 
the Secretary of War, urged the necessity for 
such a corps:

Sik: In accordance with your verbal per- 
il, I have the honor to submit t&lt; 
the inclosed project for an Hospital Torps, 
and to ask your favorable consideration tor 
Line. The plan is merely submitted as a 
on which the corps can be organized; 
much will remain to be done by regulations; 
and I propose, should you approve the inclosed 
outline, to ask for a board of medical officers 
to perfect the organization. I have not con- 
sidered it necessary to enter into details; the 
first thing essential is to obtain your sanction 
to the organization of such a corps. The 
need for it is most urgent. In no battle 
yet have the wounded been properly looked 
after; men under pretense of carrying them 
off the held leave the ranks and seldom re- 
turn to their proper duties. The adoption of 
this plan would do away with the necessity of 
taking men from the line of the army to per- 
form the duties of nurses, cooks, and attend- 
ants, and thus return sixteen thousand men 
to duty in the ranks. In view of these facts, 
and many others which could be adduced, I 
respectfully ask your approval of the inclosed 
project. 

I am, sir, very respectfully, 

Your obedient servant, 

(Signed) William A. Hammond, 

Surgeon General. 

To this the following answer was received: 

War Department, / 
Washington City, D. C, Aug. 29, 1862. \ 

Sir; The Secretary of War directs me to 
acknowledge the receipt of your communica- 
tion of the 21st instant, submitting a project 
for a Hospital Corps, and to inform you that 
the subject was referred to the General-in- 
Chief, whose views, adverse to the project, 
are expressed in the following words: "Our 
army trains are already much too large, and 
very seriously impede the movements of our 
troops in the field. The enemy have great 
advantages over us in this respect. To or- 
ganize such a medical force as is here pro- 
posed would, besides involving enormous 
expenses, greatly increase this evil. More- 
over, the presence of non-combatants on or 
near the field of battle is always detrimental, 
as most panics and stampedes originate with 
them. Medical soldiers would not obviate 
the necessity of sending fighting soldiers 
from their ranks with their wounded, for the 
former would seldom be near enough to the 
enemy to perform that duty. The soldier 
can be very much relieved by hiring cooks, 
nurses, and attendants in hospitals, whenever 






the Circumstance*) will permit; but 1 1 

no advantage in having them enlisted for 

that special purpose. All persons so em- 

d are, by law. subject to Army r&lt; 
tions. I regard this project as one calculated 
to increase the expenses and immobility of 
our army by adding to it a large cor; 
non-combatants, without any corresponding 
advantages. I therefore report against its 
adoption." 

(Signed) P. H. Watson,

A second appeal was made to the Secretary 
of War on September 7, 1862: 

Surgeon-Geni k \: ,'s Office, 
Washington, D. C, Sept. 7, 18^ 1 

Sir: I have the honor to ask your attention 
to the frightful state of disorder existing in 
the arrangements for removing the wounded 
from the field of battle. The scarcity of 
ambulances, the want of organization, the 
drunkenness and incompetency of the drivers, 
the total absence of ambulance attendants, 
are now working their legitimate results, re- 
sults which I feel I have no right to keep 
from the knowledge of the Department. The 
whole system should be under the charge of 
the Medical Department; an ambulance corps 
should be organized and set in instant opera- 
tion. I have already laid before you a plan 
for such an organization which I think covers 
the whole ground, but which I am sorry to 
find does not meet with the approval of the 
General-in Chief. I am not wedded to it. I 
only ask that some system may be adopted by 
which the removal of the sick from the field 
of battle may be speedily accomplished, and 
the suffering to which they are now subjected 
may be, in future, as far as possible avoided. 
Up to this date six hundred wounded still re- 
main on the battle field in consequence of an 
insufficiency of ambulances and a want of a 
proper system for regulating their removal, 
in the Army of Virginia. Many have died 
of starvation, many more will die in conse- 
quence of exhaustion, and all have endured 
torments which might have been avoided. I 
ask, sir, that you will give me your aid in this 
matter, that you will interpose to prevent a 
recurrence of such consequences as have fol- 
lowed the recent battle, consequences which 
will inevitably ensue on the next important 
engagement if something is not done to ob- 
viate them. 

I am, sir, very respectfully, 

Your obedient servant, 
(Signed) William A. Hammond, 

Surgeon-General U. S. A. 
Honorable E. M. Stanton, Sccrciarv of War. 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 






This also was referred to the General-in- 
Chief, and was returned endorsed as follows: 

Headquarters of the Army, ) 
Washington, Sept. 15, 1862. f 

I am informed by the Quartermaster Gen- 
eral that every effort is being made to supply 
a large number of ambulances. It is proper 
to remark, however, that the enemy have 
provided for their wounded on every battle- 
field with not one-half the ambulances and 
other facilities provided for our armies. I 
do not perceive how the drunkenness and 
incompetency of drivers are likely to be pre- 
vented any more by putting the ambulances 
exclusively under the direction of the Medi- 
cal Department. It is the duty of all officers 
to furnish fatigue parties, properly officered, 
on the requisition of medical officers, for the 
care and removal of the wounded, and it is 
the duty of all medical officers to make such 
requisitions, and if not filled, to report the 
neglect. No such neglect has been reported 
by medical officers on the recent battle-fields. 
My objections to the proposed organization 
of a separate non-combatant corps to be 
attached to the Medical Department were 
set forth in my endorsement upon a former 
letter of the Surgeon-General.

GRENADILLE POISONING. 

Doctor J. H. Smith, before the Homoeo- 
pathic Medical Society of Massachusetts, 
details several cases of " flute poisoning." 
Grenadille, or cocus wood, has for many 
years been employed in the manufacture of 
this musical instrument, inasmuch as it gives 
a brilliant and powerful sound, which mellows 
and becomes more flexible with the age of 
the instrument. Doctor Smith says: "There 
is most trustworthy testimony from Germany, 
England and America to the fact that cocus 
wood, and no other material, is found by cer- 
tain susceptible flutists capable of producing 
serious irritation of the lip, necessitating the 
use of a crescent-shaped silver or gold lip- 
plate shellacked to the mouth-hole or embra- 
zure." Doctor Smith describes the malady 
as a lip excessively swollen, extremely red, 
with large blotches covered by vesicles. Re- 
lief is had by the application of a solution of 
nitrate of lead in water, 1 to 2000.

A GOOD SERVANT BUT BAD MASTER. 

When the very manufacturers of tablet 
triturates and compressed tablets feel con- 
strained to protest against the extremes to 
which the employment of these medicaments 
has been carried, it would seem high time for 
the profession to pause and ponder. It is 
unquestionable that many physicians place 
too implicit a reliance on tablets, and fail to 
weigh properly the disadvantages inherent 
to this class of medicaments— disadvantages 
which no skill in manufacture can possibly 
eradicate. A considerable number of drugs 
may with perfect propriety be administered 
in tablet form, but to many others the tablet 
is utterly unsuited. 

At this writing we have before us the can- 
did admission of the most extensive manu- 
facturer of compressed and triturate tablets 
in the United States. With commendable 
frankness this reputable firm declares that it 
is an error to demand or employ tablets of 
volatile, readily deliquescent or delicate 
medicaments, and specifies some of the 
pharmaceutical monstrosities in current and 
popular use — combinations which have no 
raison d'etre. What, for example, is the 
use of administering in tablets hopelessly 
volatile substances like creosote, ammonium 
carbonate, menthol, camphor, and similar 
drugs? Further striking instances might be 
cited: Calomel and sodium, if exhibited at 
all in tablets, should be present only in small

DO skill in manufacture can 
come- interested claims to the contrary not- 
withstanding. The manufacturer may do his 
whole duty, may place in every tablet the 
ingredients Specified, may even issue a 
tablet that is active and reliable when it 
leaves his hands; but deterioration, in many 
instances, is sure to follow. Hence it is the 
duty of all physicians to discriminate care- 
fully, in employing this class of medicaments, 
selecting only formulas regarding which there 
can be no question. 

The tablet fad is bound ultimately to cor- 
rect itself by its very extravagance. To-day 
many dispensers seem to believe any and 
every kind and form of medicament may be 
administered in the convenient disc form; 
and, as the manufacturer quoted dryly 
remarks, we shall presently see dispensers 
ordering tablets of chloroform, alcohol, and 
aqua pura. Tablets are, perhaps, under cer- 
tain circumstances legitimate conveniences, 
but they have their limitations and are as- 
suredly not worthy of indiscriminate employ- 
ment. Beware of the tablet fad ! Abjure 
all tablets purporting to contain resins, alka- 
loids, tinctures, and other volatile or easily 
changed medicaments. 



TREATMENT OF GALL-STONES. 

Every little while we find in some journal 
wonderful revelations of the value of olive 
oil or glycerin, or some such substance, in 
the treatment of gall-stone. This fallacy, 
for some reason or other, will not down, 
though the fact remains that neither olive oil 
or glycerin is of any practical value, and that 
the so-called gall-stones that are supposed 
to be removed by these medicaments are 
nothing more than concretions of fat of 
which the medicaments themselves are the 
chief basis. 

Recently we saw a paper in which the 
declaration was made that there is absolutely 
no remedy for gall-stone except the surgeon's 
knife. This is simply rubbish. 

During the last year or two we have pub- 
lished in The Medical Age contributions to 



the literature of gall-stones from 1» 
Buckler, ( )ik hterlony, and others. Succinate 
of iron is to-day recognized by all who 
bad experience therewith as a remedy of 
practical value, not only in relieving gall- 
stones, but in preventing further aggregation 
thereof. To be Mire, an impacted gall-stmie 
may be little amenable to treatment; yet 
even this, if not too large, may often be 
remedied by the internal administration of 
chloroform. 

Doctor Huckler speaks of the treatment of 
gall-stone by succinate of iron and chloro- 
form as a satisfactory reclamation from sur- 
gery — which, to a great extent, is true. 

It speaks little for either medical or chem- 
ical knowledge when practitioners write of 
gall-stones removed by the aid of sweet oil 
and glycerin, which, as before remarked, are 
the basis of the concretions (soap balls, in 
fact) — backed by the influence of intestinal 
secretions, and shaped by vermicular action 
— which are mistaken for true biliary calculi. 



HEDICAL BIBLIOGRAPHY AND THE INDEX 
HEDICUS. 

Le Progrte Medical recently discussed the 
problem of medical bibliography "Apropos la 
mort lamentable" of the Index Medicus, The 

editor holds that while the demise of the 
Index was untimely and deplorable, it was 
nevertheless a somewhat legitimate and 
natural event, since, though this periodical 
was "useful, erudite, and complete, it did 
not solve the bibliographic problem; it was 
rather an opportunist effort." Our French 
confrere, moreover, opposes the rehabilita- 
tion of the journal in its old form, because 
"there is a science of bibliography " which it 
believes Doctors Billings and Fletcher are 
masters of. "The Index Medicus did not 
give the true solution of the best way to pre- 
sent to the medical public the current scien- 
tific work of the world." 

Commenting on the foregoing, the Medical 
Record adds this is precisely the idea it "has 
on several occasions presented and advo- 
cated:" it has ever "disliked to show 
antagonism to so useful a journal, but it has 
always seemed as though the publication 
would be more popular if the arrangement 
were different, the number of issues less fre-

quent, and the classifications somewhat more 
in accord with modern nosology." 

The Medical Age has on a previous oc- 
casion pointed out the advantages that might 
accrue if certain changes were embodied in 
the Index Medicus in case the latter is re- 
established. These are worthy of extended 
consideration on the part of the editors and 
publisher — at the same time we recognize 
the difficulty of meeting all the demands of 
the situation. We likewise believe such a 
journal would be more successful if published 
as a semi-annual or quarterly rather than in 
its former monthly form. 



DEATH FROM NITROUS OXIDE. 

It has long been popularly held that nitrous 
oxide is an absolutely safe anaesthetic— -one 
from the use of which death could not pos- 
sibly occur under any circumstances. Those 
who, however, have observed the peculiar 
cyanosis which arises during pronounced an- 
aesthesia from this agent have always felt 
that behind its apparent safety there must be 
lurking some serious element of danger. And 
now the Druggists Circular reports the death 
of a young woman in New York under the 
influence of this anaesthetic, which had been 
; taken for the removal of four teeth; more- 
j over, the young woman had on a previous 
occasion submitted to the same operation 
under like circumstances with no ill-effects. 
That such cases are rare — fortunately — 
must be admitted ; but the very fact that they 
do occur should serve to make those who ad- 
minister this anaesthetic extremely cautious. 
fit is the unexpected that happens," is an 
aphorism especially pertinent to anaesthesia, 
no matter what may be the agent employed 
to induce this condition. 



DOCTOR THOMAS KEITH. 

Doctor Keith is dead. His career is an 
illustration of the fact that much of the best 
work for the benefit of mankind is done by 
men who are themselves invalids. Doctor 
Malcom Morris, editor of The Practitioner, 
remarks: "Doctor Keith's life was one long 
struggle against ill-health, with frequent epi- 
sodes of acute suffering, of one of which I 
was myself a witness. Yet, among the pio- 



neers of abdominal surgery, who was a more 
strenuous or more successful worker than 
he? With better health Keith might have 
done more for surgery, but he could hardly 
have done better for his profession, for he 
has left it the example of a grandly heroic- 
character and a life of lofty aims nobly car- 
ried out." 



EDITORIAL NOTES. 



The Feigning of Death.— 

A discussion in Nature* regarding the 
feigning of death in reptiles induced an ex- 
periment on the currant moth, whose powers 
of "shamming" are so familiar. Oswald H. 
Latter states he first seized a moth by 
one wing, when it at once feigned death; 
thereupon he cut off its head with a pair of 
scissors, yet it continued to ftign death — abso- 
lute immobility was maintained for some 
seconds, and then violent fluttering ensued, 
causing the creature to rush wildly about 
the table, though it failed to rise into the air. 
In this condition any impulse, such as touch- 
ing or pinching, induced a repetition of 
"shamming." After a strong stimulus the 
shamming was prolonged, and indeed a direct 
connection was obvious between the strength 
of stimulus and the length of period of qui- 
escence. This power of response to stimulus 
was maintained for two days, then weak flut- 
tering set in, followed in a few hours by real 
death. 

The utter lack of any information regard- 
ing the physiology of the nervous system of 
insects, renders it impossible to draw com- 
plete conclusions from these phenomena; 
nevertheless, it is difficult to conceive that 
volition can persist for forty-eight hours in 
a decapitated animal. One is at any rate 
forced to conclude that here death-feigning 
is a purely reflex phenomenon, and that the 
sensory stimulus received by the surface of 
the body causes inhibitory impulses to arise 
reflexly from the ganglia of the central nerve 
chain, preventing all movement of the loco- 
motor muscles. In confirmation of this, it 
may be mentioned that denuding the wing of 
its scales over any area caused a marked

(totting the WOrth of Their Money.— 

The Druggists Circular, in a recent editor- 
ial dealing with so-called "lodge practice," 
supplies a great deal of interestiug informa- 
tion. It narrates the experience of a young 
physician who took the average contract to 
doctor a club or society with a membership 
of about 1500 in one of the poorer districts 
of the city. He was to receive a certain sum 
per annum for this service, and the result was 
he had a wholly unlooked-for army of patients 
to attend to; even when a child scratched its 
finger he was summoned to dress it; and some 
of his patients, not content with demanding 
services upon any and all occasions for them- 
selves, palmed off on him, as members of 
their own family, neighbors from whom they 
themselves collected a small fee. When the 
doctor summed up his work he found he had 
an average of thirty calls a day from this 
society. He was worn out with labor, could 
find no time for profitable practice, and dis- 
covered he received about three-quarters of a 
cent for each visit made. It is needless to 
add he has had enough of "society" practice, 
and will never again be a candidate for any 
position of this kind. 

It is notorious that when a physician or 
pharmacist contracts with a lodge or society, 
each individual member considers it his or 
her solemn duty to get the utmost service out 
of the unfortunate contractor. Such con- 
tracts are inimical to the best interests of 
either patient, physician, or pharmacist, and 
are always a matter of loss and worry to all 
concerned. 

Reflex Surgery.— 

The International Journal of Surgery insists 
that the "operation itch," which has so thor- 
oughly permeated the profession during the 
last quarter-century, is far from creditable. 
Commenting upon a case of melancholia re- 
ported to have been operated upon for vari-

one eye enucleated, been circunu &gt;&lt; d, had 
his spine cauterized, and worn a seton m his 
neck — being at last effectually relieved by 
the removal from his nose of a thickened I 
cartilaginous septum and the left middle tur- I 
binate, — the Journal adds: 

Inspection of the- new lopedic works 

dealing with surgical matters reveals the fact that I 

a very large number of operations were omitted I 

from this category. It is with pain we observe the I 

operation for appendicitis was not performed, and I 

that the patient's neck was not ornamented with the | 
results of thyroidectomy. 

Why not send the patient to St. Louis or 
Chicago? They do not make such mistakes 
of omission as these in the " wild and woolly." 

For Alcoholism. — 

In the Medical World Doctor Match ette 
makes the claim that in treating the alcohol 
habit he has but two per cent, of failures. His 
method consists of subcutaneous injection of 
sulphate of Hydrastine, beginning with one- 
fiftieth of a grain and increasing the dose 
until one-twentieth is given four times a day — 
preceded by a hot bath and a cathartic; vale- 
rian and bromides are employed to combat 
nervous conditions; and for the first few 
days the patient is supplied with a generous 
quantity of spirits. 

The alleged anti-alcoholic action of Hy- 
drastine is certainly somewhat of a revelation. 



Principal Peterson.— 

A deserved tribute has been given to Pro- 
fessor William Peterson by his election to the 
position of Principal of McGill University.^ 
Doctor Peterson is one who from his position |

that are prone to arise between the English 
and French races inhabiting the Province of

Medical Literature. — 

Too much of current medical literature 
and too many of the standard text-books of 
the day are made up of the results of hos- 
pital experience. An article on the manage- 
ment of 300 cases of pneumonia in some 
large hospital does not help the country 
practitioner to treat his case down on the 
river bank in a little one-room cabin with 
one door and no window, whose diet must 
depend altogether upon what he can get. It 
is useless to tell such a practitioner that in 
1000 cases treated with veratrum viride 
there were seventy per cent, of recoveries, 
or that in 15,000 cases treated with strych- 
nine the death rate was but twenty per cent. 
More than likely the reply would be that he 
treats every case according to indications 
and that his percentage of recoveries is 90 
to 100 per cent. 

The tendency of our current literature is 
to increase empiricism rather than to dimin- 
ish it; and if the men who have the advan- 
tages of large hospitals where systematic 
methods of treatment can be carried out 
upon large numbers of cases, would study 
more carefully the physiological action, and 
embody in their reports a carefully prepared 
and scientific resume' of the definite results 
obtained in each case, the benefits would be 
greater and the appreciation more marked. — 
Kansas Medical Journal. 

Longevity in France.— 

France still maintains its old reputation as 
greatly favoring old age. Doctor Salmon, 
who has just passed his 105th year, is still 
active and bright; and Doctor Boissy, of 
Havre, who has passed his 103d year, is as 
active as ever and practicing his profession 
— his father died at the age of 108. There 
still exists one survivor of the Grand Armee of 
Napoleon's heroes who trudged from Portu- 
gal to Moscow — Victor Baillot by name, now 
102 years of age. He was one of the com- 
batants at Waterloo. There are, besides Bail- 
lot, three survivors of Waterloo still living in 
France, namely: Julien Rose, born April 22d, 
1794; Sebastien Brouant, born March 31st, 
1796; and a veteran named Vanoye, born 
December 18th, 1792. At the beginning of 
the year 1895 there were still six of the old 
Napoleonic soldiers on the rolls; of these, 
two have since died, one of whom was born 
in April, 1792, and the other in April, 1794. 
As the youngest of these survivors is nearly 
a centenarian, the roll of Napoleonic veterans 



will soon be extinct. That which is most re- 
markable about French longevity is the fact 
that it also maintains the mental and physical 
activity of man to a much greater period 
than is found elsewhere.— National Popular 
Revieiu. 

Warning. — 

A certain advertising dispensary and cure- 
all has a large corps of correspondence clerks, 
and its safes preserve the confessions of almost 
a million miserable and foolish people. This 
correspondence is tabulated and followed by 
a record of the treatment, and, what is of 
more moment, of the contract and the moneys 
paid on it. Not long ago a like concern 
failed, and among the most valuable of its 
assets were similar records of 200,000 dupes. 
These the first great business house referred 
to bought of a speculator, agreeing to pay 
fifty cents apiece for each new name of a 
living person. In checking up their lists, 
60,000 of the 200,000 were found to be 
already on their books. Perhaps all readers 
of newspapers have noticed an advertisement 
for a lock of hair, upon receipt of which the 
advertiser agrees to tell the sender's fortune 
and cure his disease. The author of this 
"fake" recently retired from business, and 
his correspondence, including over 600,000 
locks of hair, was sold to an advertising con- 
cern. These are simply samples of business 
principles applied to medicine. — Medical 
News. 

The New Liquor Law in Russia.— 

With a view to diminish drunkenness with- 
out reducing the revenue, as well as to regu- 
late the prices of spirits and utterly suppress 
adulteration and sophistication, the Russian 
Imperial Government has issued a ukase that 
on and after the 1st of July, 1896, distilleries, 
private clubs, bars and liquor shops will be 
abolished in eight provinces where the Gov- 
ernment will monopolize the manufacture, 
distribution, and sale of spirits. In the July 
following the system will be extended to 
seven other provinces, and on the 1st of Jan- 
uary, 1898, to the remainder of the Russian 
territories. — Indian Medical Gazette.

Marriage, in short, is not physi&lt;

nary and sordid considerations are fac- 
tors in uniting' two people altogether unsuited 
to one another, and whose marriage is the eon- 
summation of physical ruin. On the other 
hand, owing to selfishness and self-indul- 
gence, marriage in some sections of the com- 
munity is long deferred, and the unnatural 
suppression of a natural instinct is a prime 
cause of deterioration, mental worry, and 
very frequently moral degeneration. — Cal-

Biting the Nails.— 

Bcrillon expresses the opinion that ony- 
chophagia and similar habits are generally 
associated with degeneracy. The frequency 
of nail-biting varies greatly; in some eleemo- 
synary institutions, two or three out of every 
ten children are addicted to the habit, and 
careful examination invariably reveals signs 
of degeneracy. Such children are generally 
less healthy in appearance than others, pre- 
senting deformities of the skull and anoma- 
lies of the teeth and ears; often exhibit marked 
antipathy to physical exercise and games re- 
quiring effort; write poorly, and show marked 
inferiority in manual dexterity; are slow to 
learn, and incapable of continuous applica- 
tion; in short, always exhibit an inferiority 
in some direction or other. — Medical Week.

Medical Heroism in the Chino-Japanese War 

The Broad Am W speaks in glowing terms

pliances for their comrades, and, in spite of 
withering fire, did not hesitate, but went about

Fear in Chloroform Narcosis.— 

I am inclined to put down fear as one of 
the most determinate causes of fatality from 
chloroform. I know of several instances in 
which it was impossible that chloroform, 
minus fear, could have been the direct cause 
of death, because sufficient of it was not ad- 
ministered to produce death. — Richardson. 

A Cause of Prostitution.— 

The insufficient wages paid by many of our

The Physi i Call Lis i and Record. 

By Doctor G. Archie- Stockwcll, F.Z.S. Flexible 
morocco; long i6mo; pp. 200. Price, $1.50. 
George S. Davis, Detroit. 

The fact this publication has reached its 
tenth year is sufficient evidence of its popu- 
larity and practical usefulness. Its paper 
and binding are alike superb. In size and 
shape it is by long odds the most convenient 
and the best of the "Visiting Lists;" more- 
over, it will not crumple or break down in 
the pocket. 

A prominent feature is the absence of all 
advertisements and other "dead wood," and 
the extremely convenient arrangement of its 
most practical contents. Of the information 
afforded, that most demanded for ready 
reference is to be found upon the inside 
covers or on the fly-leaves. The posological 
information and dosage table are to a great 
extent new departures, being very thorough 
and complete. 

Especially commendable is the obstetric 
table in two colors, and the arrangement for 
the. concise keeping of all accounts, debit, * 
credit, expense, profit and loss, loans, etc.l 
No physician can afford to be without this 
work.

We particularly note the value this little 
book offers the medical profession. Its title 
sufficiently gives its scope, while its size is 
such that it may conveniently be carried in 
the pocket, and consequently is ready for 
reference at any moment. In no way can 
the hydra headed demon of quackery be bet- 
ter combated than by placing in the hands of 
every medical man a copy of this Epitome, 
and securing his pledge to prescribe the for- 
mulas therein outlined in preference to the

patent and proprietary preparations which 
are of the same class and character. Such 
a course will tend materially to relieve him 
from the thraldom of the proprietary ring, 
and likewise be of material financial benefit 
both to the dispenser and the patient. 

We would ask the Louisville Botanical 
Club to place this little volume, through the 
medium of booksellers, in general circula- 
tion throughout the United States. 



A System of Surgery. By Frederick S. Dennis, 
M.D., and John S. Billings, M.D. Volume I. 
Cloth; 8vo; pp. 880. Price, $6.00. Lea Brothers 
&amp; Co., Philadelphia. 

The first volume of the new System, with 
its list of authors, is ample assurance of the 
high character of the work. The opening 
chapter (136 pages), by Doctor Billings, deals 
with "The History of Surgery," the develop- 
ment of this branch of medical art during the 
last three thousand years being briefly given 
in chronological order, along with the chief 
discoverers, improvers, inventors, and teach- 
ers. The second chapter, devoted to "Sur- 
gical Pathology," including inflammation and 
the repair of wounds — the most thorough of 
its character that has been published for 
many years — is by William T. Councilman, 
of Harvard Medical School. William Welch 
contributes a most interesting chapter upon 
"The Bacteriology of Surgical Infections;" 
while "The Symptoms, Diagnosis and Treat- 
ment of Inflammation, including Abscesses, 
Ulcers, and Gangrene," is by Charles B. 
Nancrede, one of the best known of our 
surgical writers. "Septicaemia, Pyaemia and 
Poisoned W T ounds" are treated of by W. H. 
Carmalt, of Yale; "Traumatic Fever, Ery- 
sipelas and Tetanus" is from the pen of J. 
Collins Warren, of Harvard Medical School 
— no one during the last decade has treated 
these subjects more completely. "Gunshot 
Wounds" is by P. S. Conner, "Fractures and 
Dislocations " by Frederick S. Dennis; "Anaes- 
thesia," one of the best papers that has ever 
been published by any individual or in any 
tongue, is the result of the long experience 
of Horatio C. Wood. "Antiseptic and Asep- 
tic Surgery" is by A. B. Gerster; "Operative 
Surgery" by Stephen Smith, who in this 
branch of medical science has few equals and 
no superiors.

ited by Thomas L. Stedman. Cloth; 8vo; pp. 
640. Price, $5.00. William Wood &amp; Co., New 
York. 

The third volume of this series opens with 
a very complete monograph by Norman Kerr 
on "Alcoholism and Drug Habits" — a very 



timely contribution. This is followed by a 
chapter on "Shock and Collapse," by &lt; leorge 
F.Shrady,ofNewYork. Albert L. Gihon, 
Navy, writes of " Seasickness, or Naupathia," 
"Heat Stroke," and "Frostbites." "Mountain 
Sickness" is by Georg von Liebig; "Osteoma- 
lacia," by W. T. Councilman; "Diseases of 
Occupation," by James H. Lloyd; "Vege- 
table Poisoning," by Beaumont Small, of Ot- 
tawa; "Metallic Poisoning," by James Stew- 
art, of Montreal. There is likewise a very 
comprehensive index. This is a very admir- 
able volume in that it treats of matte'rs which 
heretofore have received but little, or at best 
imperfect, attention in general medical litera- 
ture.

This may be injected into the aorta, but it 
is much less trouble to inject into the brachial 
or femoral artery — or the femoral vein. An 
anatomical syringe is desirable, but a gravity 
apparatus that will answer all purposes may 
be improvised with rubber tubing, stop-cock, 
etc. A fluidrachm is sufficient to preserve 
each ounce of animal weight. For human 
bodies it is well to calculate two and a half 
tluidounces per pound weight. — DOCTOR H. 
R. Tii.tox, U. S. Army. 

[We would inquire why the carotid artery 
should not be utilized for the purposes of 
injection, since it is as easily found as any 
other, and the results obtained are much 
more complete. The finding of the femoral 
vein in a corpse is not always practical, ex- 
cept in theory. Finally, if all this trouble is 
to be taken, a much more satisfactory fluid 
would be found in solution of Arsenite of 
Potash.— Ed.] 



Rationale of Chloroform in Parturition. — In 
all literature there are not reported more than 
forty cases of death from Chloroform during 
labor. I have given every half-hour for from 
twenty to forty hours, without any trouble 
following; have seen a profound Chloroform 
operation in obstetrics, lasting for three or 
four hours, without grave effects. The alter- 
ation in the vaso-motor system of a pregnant 
woman enables her to resist the toxic action 
of Chloroform to this wonderful extent. Not 
only is its use in labor for the relief of pain 
alone justifiable, but it would be inhuman to 
withhold it. It is the anaesthetic of all others 
peculiarly adapted to parturition. It is ap- 
plicable in any stage, in small quantities. To 
remove muscular rigidity of the cervix or 
perineum a larger quantity is required, until 
there follows complete muscular relaxation. 
Chloroform tends to prevent uterine contrac- 
tions, only when given in large quantities. It 
does not tend to promote haemorrhage, as 



has ! ■ that 

tcr tendency thereto after than without

careless use of this anasthetic at any and all 
tunes. — 1 )&gt; i« 1 1 »k J. E. 1 &gt;. J&lt; »m 5, in i

Penetrating ft of the Chest. — It is 

solutely n&lt; to treat the wounded on 

the spot, owing to serious disadvantages 
arising from removal, however short the dis- 
tance; haemoptysis is especially apt to super- 
vene through the shaking of the carriage. 
Syncope should be regarded, to a certain 
extent, as favoring haemostasis; subcutaneous 
injections of caffeine or artificial serum are 
therefore preferable to ether, unless the de- 
pression is very considerable. Treatment by 
the ordinary means is not sufficiently effica- 
cious if one does not at the very first subject 
the patient to as absolute immobility as can 
be obtained. The employment of sutures, 
ligatures, antisepticism, and methodic closure 
of the wound, which can be done with the 
minimum of movement, are permissible. If 
there is hemothorax, there should, as a rule, 
be no haste in the matter of interference, 
still one must be guided by the symptoms 
and complications; resort should be had to 
paracentesis only when the effusion is very 
large and when dyspneeic phenomena give 
rise to anxiety. After the wound is cared 
for, unnecessary dressing of patient should 
be avoided, since such entails more or less 
shaking and movement. - Quarterly Medical 
Journal. 



Bronchiectasis and Lung Gangrene T&gt; 
bx Intro-pulmonary Injections. — Since 1878 I 
have adopted a method, suggested by Doctor 
Seifert in 1883, of treating cases of bronchi- 
ectasis and gangrene by intra pulmonary in- 
jections of Carbolic acid. After completely 
disinfecting the chest wall, a long needle at- 
tached to a Pravaz syringe containing Car- 
bolic acid solution, three-per-cent., is thrust 
into the intercostal space over the cavity, 
and one or two cubic centimeters slowly in- 
jected. Usually the patients smell, at once, 
the carbolic, and have an attack of coughing, 
which is less the more slowly the injection is 
made. The needle is withdrawn and collo- 
dium applied. I have treated forty-three 
cases of bronchiectasis and seven of pulmo- 
nary gangrene in this way, and never seen 
any ill-effects; moreover, in all the cases of 
bronchiectasis the improvement was very 
great, both in the local malady and in the

general health. Even in the most severe 
cases of pulmonary gangrene the sputa be- 
came much less offensive and diminished in 
quantity, and in three of the milder circum- 
scribed cases recovery followed in eight, 
eleven, and thirteen days, respectively. — 
Rokitansky, in Gazette des Hopitaux. 



Obstetric Aphorisms. — By observation and 
palpation, satisfy yourself that the patient is 
actually in labor: 

Ascertain if bowels and bladder are empty; 
if not, empty them at once: 

Make a digital and bimanual examination, 
determine presentation and relative size of 
head and birth-canal; if abnormal or difficult 
presentation, try to correct it: 

Examine at regular intervals to see that 
the labor, if normal, remains so; if abnormal, 
to improve presentation if possible, and in 
either instance to note progress: 

If, from failure of contractions after dila- 
tation of os, from great size of head, small 
size of pelvis, or other causes, delay seems 
dangerous, apply forceps: 

Protect perineum and if necessary retard 
extra rapid second stage: 

Never allow the head to be retained long 
after delivery of body, in breech presenta- 
tions: 

Always examine placenta carefully, and if 
portions are, or even seem to be, detached, 
go after them at once: 

Observe absolute cleanliness throughout. 
— E. T. Brady, in Virginia Medical Monthly. 



Strophanthus. — Strophanthus is a muscle 
poison; it only acts upon the heart as it 
acts upon the other muscles, but it so 
happens that the heart muscle is very sus- 
ceptible to its influence — more than the 
voluntary muscles; and so in human medi- 
cine we are able to get the maximum stimu- 
lant effect @n the heart before we get it on 
the other muscles. It is a drug, therefore, 
that acts directly as a stimulant to the heart 
muscle, increasing susceptibility and causing 
it to react more readily than normal. But 
there is no reason to think that, like digitalis, 
it acts further as a tonic as well as a stimu- 
lant. Then, again, the muscle of the arteries 
is acted upon by Strophanthus, and so con- 
tracts the arteries. It increases arterial pres- 
sure; it empties the veins and fills the arteries 
by stimulating the heart. It differs, I may 
say, in its action from digitalis, in being more 
distinctly diuretic; it is much more prompt 
than digitalis, acting at once; it is much less 
permanent than digitalis. All practical points. 
H. C. Wood, in Cleveland Medical Gazette. 



Caffeine in Diseases of Respiratory Organs. — 
Caffeine acts on the respiratory organs directly 
by inducing relaxation of bronchial spasm, 
and indirectly through its tonic action on the 
heart. It is to the first effect that I desire to 
direct special attention: 

In my experience Caffeine holds first place 
in the treatment of spasmodic asthma. Dur- 
ing the paroxysm five grains are ordered 
every nine hours until spasm is relieved, after 
which it is given at longer intervals to pre- 
vent a relapse. When the attack comes on 
fairly regularly every morning and evening, a 
dose of five or ten grains will often prevent 
it altogether, or render it so slight that the 
patient is able to sleep through it. Caffeine 
also relaxes the spasm which is frequently 
present in acute or chronic bronchitis and 
emphysema, and thus relieves dyspnoea in so 
far as it is due to this element. Physiology 
throws no light upon the mode of action of 
Caffeine in the conditions referred to: I have, 
however, never observed any ill-effects from 
its use, except occasional wakefulness. — 
Markham Skerritt, in The Practitioner 
(London). 



External Use of Aconite Root. — The exter- 
nal use of Aconite root has been by me found 
very useful in relieving pain and subduing 
the swelling of the lymphatic glands, par- 
ticularly those of the groins and axillae. My 
mode of applying it is very simple. I get a 
root of Aconite and rub it with a little water 
on some stone. When the water becomes 
turbid I apply it on the swelling, and advise 
the patient to use dry fomentations in addi- 
tion. Many cases have been thus relieved 
before their buboes were "ripe." A young 
man was suffering from sympathetic buboes 
of both groins, and on examination I found 
them very much swollen and painful. By ap- 
plication of the Aconite root, relief from pain 
was secured on the first day, and within a 
fortnight all the swelling subsided. The 
fomentation was carried out by means of a 
heated brick wrapped up in a piece of cloth. 
The native names for Aconite root are: 
Mathia telia, Telia bikh or bish, and the hill 
men of this place call it Mohra. — Thana 
Ram, in Indian Medical Record. 



Cure for Dandruff. — Suffering much incon- 
venience from dandruff, and having resorted 
to many advertised nostrums and other means 
for relief, among which were various alcoholic 
solutions of castor oil, and washing the scalp 
with solutions of borax and carbonate of 
potassa— which latter, although effectual for 
the relief from the dandruff, seemed to im-

pair the vitality of the hair a-. it to 

becoo bly thinner,— I was finally 

induced to try a preparation of an on: 
the fl Sulphur in a quart of water, as 

follows, with the happiest result: The Sul- 
phur was repeatedly agitated in the « 

at intervals for a few hours, and the 
liquid then poured off; with this the head 
tturated every morning. In a few weeks 
every trace of dandruff disappeared, and the 
hair became soft and glossy. After dis 
tinning the treatment for eighteen months, 
there is no return of the disease. — Louisville 
Medical Monthly. 



Operation/or Varicose J'eins. — I have treated 
164 cases of varices without a single failure, 
by means of hypodermatic injections, eight 
drops at a dose, into one of the principal 
varicose confluents, of a solution containing 
Iodine and Tannin, one and nine parts re- 
spectively; the operation is without anaes- 
thesia, and repeated when necessary, during 
which the patient stands, a rubber tube hav- 
ing been placed at the root of the thigh. By 
this operation a hypertrophic phlebitis is 
brought on with thickening of the venous 
walls, and consequent resistance to dilata- 
tion. After operation the veins are com- 
pressed ten centimeters above and below the 
puncture, the limb wrapped in boric-acid cot- 
ton, and the patient kept rigorously on his 
back in bed. The possibility of embolism is 
purely theoretical and not borne out by facts.

Solvent for Sordes. — 

U Boric acid, 30 grains. 

Potassium chlorate, 20 grains. 
Lemon-juice, 5 drachms. 
Glycerin, 3 drachms. 

When the teeth are well rubbed with this 
the sordes easily and quickly becomes de- 
tached; little harm will follow from the acid 
present. The boric acid attacks the masses 
of bacilli and bacteria, and the chlorate of 
potassium cools and soothes the membrane; 
the glycerin and lemon moisten the parts 
and aid the salivary secretion. — Doctor 
MacGregor, in British Medical Journal. 

[Doctor MacGregor apparently takes no 
account of the chemical reaction between the 
potassium chlorate and the lemon-juice. — 
Ed.1 



It acts as a diuretic when given in 

»f four days, — a diuretic 
is readily obtained on the fourth 
and continues twrnty-four hours cdter its 
withdrawal; but the dropsy may entirely dis- 
appear in live to ten hours: 

The diureti- omel is a second 

ary phenomenon; it first acts as a laxative: 

With repeated four days' With laxa- 

tive doses of Calomel and intermediate ad- 
ministration of cardiac remedies, it is possible 
to obtain substantial relief for a long time: 

After a few such cycles the pericardium 
again responds to cardiac remedies. — DOC- 
TOR Pi tSETSKI, in M edeciniskoie Obozretiije. 



Black Haw in Abortion. — After employing 
in several cases, I find that, contrary to the 
generally accepted opinion, this remedy does 
not always prevent miscarriage; may some- 
times even occasion, or at least often acceler- 
ate it when already begun. The haemostatic 
action of the drug, however, was constantly 
observed, but in every instance after the first 
day uterine contractions followed, favoring the 
commenced abortion. In three cases, directly 
after the administration of a dose, contraction 
of the external os was observed. I therefore 
believe that although Viburnum may occupy 
a prominent place in the treatment of diseases 
peculiar to females, it is not without a degree 
of danger where there is threatened abortion.

Painless Injection of Hydrocele.— Puncture 
with a trocar, permit about a third of the 
fluid to flow off, then inject three to four 
cubic centimeters of a one-percent, watery 
solution of cocaine through the cannula; 
gently knead the sac four or five minutes, 
following which the remaining fluid may be 
allowed to flow out. Tincture of iodine, 
either pure or mixed with one-third water, 
according to the character of the hydrocele, 
may now be injected; the sac is again gently 
kneaded, and at the expiration of four or live 
minutes the iodine drawn off. In this manner 
the operation is absolutely painless and the 
danger of cocaine poisoning practically nil. — 
\i&lt; \isk, in Wiener Medic inische Presse. 



Calomel in Heart Disease. — Mercurous 
Chloride is indicated in dropsy due to heart 
disease, accompanied with icterus; in the 
absence of the latter it is contra-indicated: 



Triticum Rcpcns.— Couch Grass is an old 
remedy, and can be relied upon in its limited 
field of action. Where there is bloody urine, 
with no pain or soreness to indicate the exact 
location, and where exercise decreases the 
amount of blood, it proves most satisfactory; 
it is also frequently beneficial in cases of 
strangury and irritation. The infusion is ap-

parently the most effective form for prescrib- 
ing, but where this is inconvenient the fluid 
extract in doses of one to ten drops, well 
diluted and administered every hour or 
oftener, will perhaps answer as well. This 
old remedy deserves a trial at the hands of 
the younger physicians. — Eclectic Medical 
Journal. 



Quinine in Corneal Ulceration. — One of the 
most noted London ophthalmic surgeons, an 
original thinker and positive prescriber, rec- 
ommended most strongly — entirely supplant- 
ing iodoform in the local treatment of corneal 
ulceration during diphtheritic conjunctivitis 
and severe ophthalmia — a lotion composed 
of three to four grains of Quinine to the 
ounce of water; the salt is dissolved in the 
smallest amount of sulphuric acid, the water 
being subsequently added. During the bad 
form of the disease he employs as "eye- 
drops " and applies compresses saturated 
with the same to the lids. — Medical Review. 



Useless tie ss of the Vaginal Douche. — The 
douche in normal labor cases is apparently 
useless, for in 407 such where it was not used 
the mortality was 5.6 per cent., while in 400 
other cases in which it was employed the 
death-rate rose to thirteen per cent. In an- 
other series of 800 cases, only eighty-four per 
cent, of those who received the douche never 
had a temperature over 98 F., while of those 
who were let alone over ninety per cent, 
passed the puerperium free from fever. — 
Leopold, in Archiv fur Gynaekologie . 



Chloral as a Vesicant. — Put finely powdered 
Chloral hydrate in the centre of a piece of 
adhesive plaster, taking care to leave an un- 
covered margin. Now heat the plaster until 
the Chloral is melted, and apply to the previ- 
ously oiled skin. In from ten to fifteen 
minutes a large blister will be formed, with 
only a slight burning sensation. The Chloral 
should not be allowed to remain in contact 
with the skin longer than fifteen minutes, 
since there is then danger of inducing ulcera- 
tion. — Doctor Ivanobski. 



Hypertrophy of the Prostate. — Intra-testicu- 
lar injections of Cocaine twice a week will 
reduce the volume of the hypertrophied pros- 
tate, thus completely replacing castration. 
In patients thus treated, the symptoms at- 
tendant upon prostatic hypertrophy rapidly 
disappeared; the gland gradually decreased in 
'size; the final result was complete and last- 



ing cure, with retention of potency but com- 
plete absence of spermatozoa.— /,/ Semaitu 
Medicate. 



Varicose Veins. — Pulsatilla is often of bene- 
fit in the treatment of varicosities, inasmuch 
as it acts upon the vascular system, and 
above all relaxes the right side of the heart, 
the veins and the capillaries. Witch Hazel 
much resembles Pulsatilla in this respect, and 
sometimes is even more beneficial; it causes 
dilatation of the blood vessels with blood 
stasis and sequences. — Doctor Mossa, in 
Allgemeine Homceopathische Zeitung. 



Cajeput Oil in Pneumonia. — Cajeput oil is 
of great value in asthenic pneumonia. As a 
cardiac stimulant it is as powerful and as 
quick in action as either alcohol or ether, 
and like them relieves the heart by dilating 
the systemic arterioles; but, unlike them, it 
does not diminish the sensitiveness of the 
respiratory centre.— Doctor Fov, in Medical 
Press and Circular.

One morning the thrifty farmer's busy wife 
completed a very important event — the 

picking of hei She was gratified to 

find that this picking added to previous pick- 
,vould give her that which she had long 
desired — feathers enough for a new bed. A 
few days later the tick was prepared, stuffed, 
and then placed on the bedstead in the " spare'' 
room, where it was occasionally used by a 
passing guest. 

The time for the housewife's accouchement 
approaching, it was decided that she should 
have the new bed. When she was taken with 
labor she lay upon this bed and gave birth to 
her child, and, notwithstanding the ordinary 
precaution to prevent soiling, some amniotic 
fluid and blood filtered through into the feath- 
ers. 

Mrs. W. did not "do well;" she was con- 
fined to bed much longer than usual, and 
there was an offensive vaginal discharge 
which also percolated, at times, into the 
feathers. She, however, finally recovered, and 
the new feather bed was externally cleansed 
and placed on the fence "to air," a process 
that occupied one day, and then placed on the 
family couch for husband, wife, and baby. 

1 lot months again came around. The hus- 
band, after working hard all day in the fields, 
would lie down early, dispensing with the 
bath, and his perspiration, which was profuse 
and strong, would be absorbed by the bed, 
together with that of the wife; the baby, 
which had grown and waxed strong, would 
also add his mite in the shape of urine and 
occasionally a thin faecal discharge. During 
this time the feather bed would be cleansed 
and aired frequently, for Mrs. W. was a foe 
to dirt — her shining pots and pans and her 
scrupulously clean kitchen being prima facie 
evidence of her cleanliness. 

Time passed on, and diphtheria made its 
appearance in the neighborhood. The W. 
children were attacked; as they were taken 
they were in succession placed in the family 
bed. Farmer W.'s children were subsequently 
"sickly;" the mother said " it seemed like her 
children took every disease going around, and 
still they had been in no place to catch it." 
Finally one of the children took down with 
phthisis and died, and in course of time an- 
other was attacked with the same disease. 

And now it became necessary to summon a 
new doctor, whose first measure was to in- 
spect the premises and learn their sanitary 
condition. He seemed to be struck with the 
frequency with which the feather bed appeared 



in the more recent troubles; he inquired if it 
had been whenM;- \\ : eplied, with 

pardonable pride, that it had been "stirred 
and aired" frequently, and "although there 

-tains upon the outer covering thev 
indelible, for she scrubbed them often." Upon 
request, permission Was -ranted the doctor to 
examine the interior. Thereupon, with a knife 

he ripped the tick open and to the astonished 

gaze Of Mrs. W. displayed, despite the super- 
ficial cleansing and "airing" the bed had re- 
ceived, a glutinous mass of mouldy, stinking 
feathers, in the lower parts of which were vile, 
slimy vermin, and in one corner a nest of 
roaches. "Here," said he, "is the cause of 
the sickness and death with which you have 
been afflicted in the past. This festering 
mass is not of recent origin, but is the re&gt;ult 
of months and years of accumulated filth 
filtering through, little by little, at various 
times." . . . 

That evening Farmer W. built a fire in the 
pasture lot back of the barn, and there was a 
cremation of feather bed, filth, slime, bugs 
and all, and from that day feather beds were 
banished from that house, and sickness 
brooded no longer over that family. — Lyman 
W ATKINS, in Eclectic Medical Journal. 






The Cold Bath in iiii Pneumonia of 
Children. — Excellent effects are yielded by 
balneotherapy in the pneumonia of quite 
young infants. Applied at a temperature of 
25 or 20 C, according to age and circum- 
stances, the cold bath is most serviceable in 
reducing temperature, restoring lost tone, and 
slowing the pulse and respiration. Chemical 
antithermic agents, such as acetanilid and its 
ilk, are generally useless and may be danger- 
ous. In my wards I give cold baths to all 
my little pneumonic patients whose tempera- 
ture exceeds 102. 2° F. and whose hearts are 
not diseased. Quite recently I had an op- 
portunity to note the good effects of this 
treatment in a little boy affected with influ- 
enzal pneumonia of the right apex, uninflu- 
enced by ordinary antithermic drugs. Baths 
at 25 C. are quite well supported by even 
very young infants. The application of this 
method determines the onset of the crisis on 
the fifth instead of the seventh day, and so 
materially shortens the duration of the dis- 
ease; it is, moreover, the best means of ob- 
taining prompt defervescence in the pneu- 
monia of adults. At the Aubervilliers fever 
hospital M. Siredey has derived great advan- 
tage from the employment of cold baths in 
the treatment of broncho-pneumonia con- 
secutive to specific fevers; and M. LeOendre 
corroborates their efficacy in all congestive

complications of eruptive fevers. Hayem 
declares that at the Hospital St. Antoine the 
most fatal disease of all is pneumonia, and 
that eighteen out of twenty of these patients 
are "alcoholics." During the first two years 
(1879-1880) of his physicianship at that hos- 
pital the death-rate was fifty per cent.; but 
with the institution of the cold-bath treat- 
ment the mortality fell to twenty-seven or 
twenty-eight per cent., and for some time 
past this mortality has further diminished to 
eight or ten per cent., an improvement as- 
scribed to a new treatment especially devised 
for the benefit of alcoholics. Employed in 
the creche attached to his wards, Professor 
Hayem finds the cold baths more powerful 
for good against pneumonia than when used 
for adults. — M. Comby, in The Lancet (Lon- 
don). 

The Walscher Position for Labor. — It 
has long been known that there is a certain 
amount of mobility in the joints of the pelvis, 
especially during pregnancy. But it remained 
for WalScher (1889) to show that the antero- 
posterior diameter of the pelvic inlet varies 
with the position of the body. The sacro-iliac 
synchondroses are true joints with synovial 
membranes, articular cartilages, and strong 
supporting ligaments. The innominate bones 

! revolve to a limited extent about the sacrum, 
upon an axis passing through the sacrum 
several centimeters below the level of its 
promontory, and Walscher found that when 
the pelvis is, as it were, extended, the con- 
jugata vera is from nine to fifteen millimeters 
longer than when flexed upon the trunk. 
The universal position of a woman, when 
forceps are applied, has been upon the back 

I or side, with the thighs flexed upon the ab- 
domen; in this position the symphysis pubis 
approaches the promontory of the sacrum, 
and the true conjugate of the pelvic inlet is 
shortened six or seven millimeters. On the 
other hand, if the thighs are forcibly ex- 
tended, with the patient upon her back and 
her lower extremities hanging down over the 
edge of a table or bed, considerable traction 
is exerted upon the anterior portion of the 
pelvis; it is forcibly extended, and the con- 
jugata vera is lengthened six to eight milli-' 
meters. The increase in length, therefore, 
of the antero-posterior diameter of the pel- 
vic inlet in the Walscher position over that 
in the position universally assumed, is from 
one to one-and-a-half centimeters. By placing 
women in this position in the first stage of 
labor, Fehling and others have secured spon- 
taneous births in cases where forceps or other 
instrumental means had been necessary in 
previous labors. It must be borne in mind, 



however, that the Walscher position 
value only when the head is at the superior 
strait; after a head has entered the pelvic 
cavity this position should be dispensed with, 
as by the sinking in of the lower end of the 
sacrum and coccyx the antero-posterior 
diameter of the pelvic outlet is shortened. — 
American Gynecological and Obstetrical Jour- 
nal. 



Bacteriological Diagnosis of Diphthe- 
ria. — To procure this, the physician must 
collect on a cotton swab some of the dis- 
charge from the throat of a suspected patient, 
put the cotton in a sterilized glass tube, and 
mail to a bacteriologist. The latter examines 
with a microscope, and notifies the doctor 
if he finds the Klebs-Loeffler bacillus, and 
then the doctor isolates the patient, placards 
the house, and alarms the neighborhood. 
Next the bacteriologist proceeds to make 
"cultures" with which he inoculates a guinea- 
pig; if the pig sickens, the specimen is sus- 
picious, and if it dies in seven days this is 
proof positive that the case is true diphthe- 
ria, and the doctor is so notified. But if the 
guinea-pig does not sicken in a few days, the 
case is not diphtheria, and the doctor may 
remove the placard and record the case as 
anything he pleases — his professional stand- 
ing having been duly humbled and that of 
the bacteriologist glorified. 

These steps will have occupied from five 
to ten days, according to speed of mail car- 
riage, supply of guinea-pigs, and leisure of 
the experimentor. By the time the doctor 
receives this costly diagnosis, the case will be 
so far advanced that any fool could diagnose 
it accurately; yet this slow bacteriological 
process is lauded as satisfying the need of an 
early diagnosis. Heaven save the mark, and 
save the patient also; for, were the case 
diphtheria, it would either be well, or beyond 
hope, or dead, before the doctor got the 
diagnosis from the "scientist " 

Yet, to sustain this pretentious fad, an 
educated profession is asked to abnegate its 
own intelligence, and ■ the public purse is 
drawn on to support expensive officers, 
mostly of foreign origin, who are of no prac- 
tical use beyond drawing their salary.— Doc- 
tor W. H. Cook, in Medical Brief. 



Sexual Anomalies in Women. — Novak, 

of Christiania, states that independent of im- 
potency and sterility there exists an absence 
of volupty but little discussed by gynaecolo- 
gists, although it may produce serious results 
in married life. There is a distinction be-

. sexual instinct and the sense of the 
J instinct depends upon 
psychical imp] reflected to the genital 

5; while sexual feeling produced by a 
local irritation of the gen: 1 much less 

intensity. Want of sexual feeling is usually 
due to sonu- central nervo n trouble. 

It may be absent in a woman in whom the 
sexual organs are perfectly normal, or in 
- of congenital or acquired malformation, 
ally where the clitoris is absent. Sex- 
ual feeling may be present or absent in abso- 
lute amenorrhoea. Congenital absence of 
sexual feeling is comparatively rare; the 
trouble is acquired much more frequently 
than is usually believed; it is seen especially 
in the newly married and in hysterical indi- 
viduals. Contrary to the ordinary opinion, 
hysterical people do not, as a rule, have 
strong sexual feeling, although they are very 
desirous of attention from the other sex. In- 
tense brain-work and violent emotion which 
depress the individual exert a depressing 
effect on the volupty. The same is true of 
continuous sedentary employment, too rich 
food, and too great obesity. Inability to en- 
joy the sexual orgasm has the following 
causes: Psychical — want of personal sym- 
pathy with the man: Excessive masturba- 
tion: Abnormalities in the woman whereby 
the sexual act produces painful congestion of 
the genital organs, and the normal relaxation 
does not take place: Exhaustion of the cen- 
tral nervous system from sexual excesses: 
Finally, painful genital condition. Treat- 
ment for most cases is, absolute continence; 
the exhausted nerve centres should not be 
excited by the imagination. Temporary sep- 
aration from the husband is most important. 
Tonic and quieting drugs can be used. —

Elkctric Current Accidents. — When a 
person meets with an accident due to contact 
with electric conductors or generators, the 
contact must first be broken, if it still exists, 
as otherwise those wfoo come to render as- 
sistance may also become victims: 

The sufferer should be carried to a well 
ventilated room, from which all persons ex- 
cept, at the most, three or four assistants, are 
excluded: 

Loosen the clothing at once, and at the 
earliest possible moment make an effort to 
re-establish respiration and circulation. To 
restore respiration, recourse should be had to 
rhythmical traction on the tongue, and arti- 
ficial respiration, but both must be continued 
for a sufficiently long time: the circulation 
should at the same time be stimulated by rub- 



bing of the skin, flagellation of the trunk 
with the hand or wet towels, and any other 
means usually resorted to in sue':.

sometimes accompanied by an arterial mur- 
mur; when it can be heard, and aortic re- 
gurgitation excluded, a positive diagnosis of 
aneurysm can be made, even in the absence

pure aortic regurgitation the sign is always

to diagnose aneurysm, from this sign alone,

Glucose as Food. — It appears to have 
been generally accepted that commercial glu- 
cose is suitable for food. This opinion was 
promulgated some years ago by American 
chemists, and has been made the basis for 
justification of much substitution and adulter- 
ation. Mere chemical knowledge, or even 
experiments on the lower animals or healthy 
subjects for a brief period, are not sufficient 
to establish the harmlessness of a substitute 
food. Glucose made from starch by the ac- 
tion of acid is not the same as the product of 
digestion by animal ferments, and it is not 
likely that it will be a satisfactory substitute 
for the forms of sugar that arise in the pro- 
cess of normal digestion. — E. H. BARTLEY,

THE GERM THEORY OF DISEASE. 

BY C. W. CRAM, M.D. 

As the microbe doctrine, or germ theory of 
disease, has many honest adherents, I pro- 
pose, for their benefit, to lay bare some of 
the unfounded pretentions of its authors. 
My warrant for this is in the fact that human 
life is too sacred, and the unselfish intelli- 
gence of our time too critical, to tolerate 
error where health and life interests are at 
stake. 

At the outset I wish to point out the press- 
ing need of accurate knowledge of the nature 
of disease and of scientific means for its cure, 
in the department of practical medicine. It 
is here, in the shadow of diphtheria and 
tuberculosis, that bacteriology has its chief 
wallow. In this department the real nature 
of disease has never been taught. It has been 
a profound mystery, and as a result we have 
a half-dozen schools of medicine all hold- 
ing views at variance with each other, either 
as to the nature or as to the treatment of 
disease, or both. The result of this dense 
ignorance of the nature of disease, and the 
administration of powerful drugs without 
scientific guidance, is a heavy death-rate that 
puts the conscientious physician to the blush, 
especially as this death-rate does not occur 
in surgery, nor in the department of obstet- 
rics. — Out of one hundred deaths, not of the 
aged, ninety-five are in the department of 
practical medicine. Surgery presents grand 
results because it has a basis for scientific 
work. Its diseases are well known; they can 
be seen, understood, manipulated, and cured. 
So in obstetrics the conditions are well known, 
and this department is taught in our medical 
colleges as a matter of absolute science. But 
practical medicine has been in the "slough of 
despond " for more than 2000 years. 



Up to a very recent period it was taught 
that medical diseases were of the blood: 
diphtheria was a blood disease, and so was 
typhoid fever. We now know that this old 
theory, that was taught for fully 2300 years. 
was erroneous. The error in the theo: 
disease led directly to the adoption of prin- 
ciples of practice that were pernicious and 
deadly. But, mark you, the theory, though 
false, was on the right line, inasmuch as it 
had reference to disease itself, not the cause. 

Now look at the sad spectacle presented 
by the germ theory. When teachers broke 
their hold on the old blood theory, and 
turned their backs upon blood-letting, roast- 
ing, starving and salivating their patients, 
they tacitly admitted that medical practice 
had always been in the deepest of deep mud, 
and that their pretended knowledge of dis- 
ease had been all sham. Their teaching 
upon the nature of disease had been mere 
twaddle. Thus situated, they were too much 
dazed to contemplate disease with a view to 
offer a theory as to its real nature; they did 
not observe the bright light that physiology 
was throwing upon the subject. They did 
not hear the voice nor feel the impulse that 
came throbbing up from the previous cen- 
tury, declaring that Hoffmann, Cullen and 
Erasmus Darwin were pointing to the ner- 
vous system as the guide in medical practice; 
nor did they see, all about them in clear-cut 
letters of light, this truth-giving dispensation 
of vivisection; "As anatomy is to surgery, so 
is physiology to practical medicine. Pathol- 
ogy is deranged physiology. Reinstate phys- 
iology, and restore your patient to health." 
They saw none of it. 

However, a will-o'-the-wisp came sailing 
over the turbid waters, and, like a true bacteri- 
ologist, dropped the inspiring legend: " Dis- 
ease? No matter what it is, the microbe 
caused it. Kill the microbe." 

The professors saw it, and took it in; dis-

cussed it for three minutes — adopted it —

theory sprouted, they drifted ashore and 
planted it. 

But it w ipliog until tl

rerman chemists. Then it grew apace, 
and is now a growth that l dark and

money makes the marc go, 
ies it make the sapling grow. 

But what of the fruit of this tree ? Can it 
be other than deadly? Is aetiology to be the 
goal of medical research ? Is the morbid anat- 
omy that invites death to be dissipated by the 
phantom of an exciting cause? Think for a 
moment of the supreme absurdity of giving 
the cause, that starts unseen and by chance, a 
mountain-like prominence over the grim dis- 
ease that enters the human body to kill by a 
death process that science can uncovei and 
defy! Who, caught in the whirl of a tornado, 
will sit down calmly to investigate its origin ? 
What surgeon, called to dress an incised 
wound, would pause to know whether it was 
caused by the slash of a razor or the thrust 
of a knife ? 

The sheer folly of putting the cart before 
the horse has been universally condemned by 
all sane men; yet this is the offering of bacter- 
iology to the medical profession of the day, and 
this alone should bar the acceptance of the 
germ theory. Not only do bacteriologists per- 
form this foolish act when they magnify the im- 
portance of the exciting cause, but they repeat 
it when they make their claim that microbes 
produce disease. All admit that the germs 
exist in connection with disease, but the dis- 
ease precede* them. They are harmless scav- 
engers feeding upon the debris of morbid 
tissues or deranged secretions. Belonging 
to the protista of Haeckel, they are on the 
same level as elementary cells, and cannot 
sustain life by feeding upon vitalized tissues; 
it is only in the devitalized elements of de- 
cay and rottenness that they are able to sus- 
tain their low form of life; and this has been 
admitted by all leading advocates of the 
germ theory; and finally the claim that the 
microbe per se causes the disease has been 
abandoned, and a ptomaine, for which the 



microbe is held responsible, is substituted 
as th

compelled to change their claim before its 

had numbered a dozen 
fatal to the domination of their pr&lt; 
claim, for it is clearly more untenable than 
the first As their whole structure rests upon 
assumption in two disease* — diphtheria and 
pulmonary tuberculosis — it must fall 
miniously unless clearly sustained at these 
two points. That it will not be so sustained 
is clear because: 

The fact that some cases of diphtheria 
die before a false membrane is formed is 
proof that death did not, in such cases, occur 
from either bacillus or ptomaine in connec- 
tion with false membrane: 

Where the membrane, with its so-called 
pathogenic bacillus, exists, the pathological 
fact of irritation, congestion, and inflamma- 
tion, at the site of the membrane, always pre- 
cedes it and its bacillus. — So neither bacillus 
nor ptomaine is at the inception to inspire the 
morbid process; and death, if it occurs, is 
wholly unaccounted for by the germ theory. 
This holds in all cases of diphtheria: 

The animal chemistry of the body, as 
well as the throat pathology, shuts out the 
germ theory not only in diphtheria, but in all 
epidemic diseases. 

All medicines and poisons not only invade 
the domain of animal chemistry, but each has 
an action characteristic of itself. The effect 
of prussic acid and ammonia is seen almost 
instantly on being administered, while it re- 
quires about five hours to obtain the maximum 
effect of quinine and digitalis. Upon this 
range as to acute effect come all the poisons, 
without exception, the ever-prevailing process 
that presents the effect being the work of the

is 



organic laws of assimilation and disassimila- 
tion in the animal chemistry of the body. 
This fact absolutely shuts out all aetiological 
claim for the ptomaine of the bacillus, for if 
such poison existed it must of necessity, to 
produce disease, enter the blood current 
from the stomach, or from the lungs, or by 
absorption from the alimentary tract, and 
conform to the organic laws to which I have 
referred. That nothing of the kind occurs may 
be seen in the incubation of the diphtheria, and, 
all epidemic disease poison, the period for this

process extending from three to ten days. Here 
the important fact is disclosed that the setio- 
logical poison of the epidemics, whatever it 
may be, does not circulate through the body 
and do its toxic work by way of the blood. 

Now the logical conclusion follows that 
the special poison of diphtheria performs its 
deadly work through some channel not yet 
demonstrated in connection with disease. In 
this connection it is necessary to exercise a 
little thought. Let us call up the history of 
the epidemic diseases, and carefully view the 
symptoms as seen in the pathology of the 
cases. What do we see ? The clear proof 
that all of the primary symptoms declare the 
involvement of the central nervous system. — 
And this holds good in typhoid fever as well 
as the epidemics. In studying the exanthe- 
matous maladies, we observe that the erup- 
tion first appears on the fauces, then on the 
forehead, face, neck, body, and lower limbs, 
about two days being occupied in this exten- 
sion of the eruption from the fauces to the 
feet. Here we not only have proof that the poi- 
son of the epidemics assails the nervous sys- 
tem, but that the several poisons that stand 
in a causative relation to the eruptive dis- 
eases are directed to the organic system of 
nerves, the morbid involvement extending 
downward along the line of the ganglia, not 
through the spinal cord. Primarily the blood 
is not in the least involved. The origin of 
the eruption on the fauces and face proves 
that the ganglia at the base of the brain are 
first involved. How? Possibly the poison 
reaches the medulla oblongata and the basal 
ganglia through the olfactory nerve, which 
is, through night as well as day, exposed to 
the poisonous gases and irritating particles 
of matter that are afloat in the atmosphere. 
It is possible, too, that the poison enters 
the taste-bulbs and passes to the medulla 
through the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. How- 
ever, in the case of diphtheria it must be 
remembered that the sub-maxillary gland is 
generally involved and much swollen; that 
this gland has nerve supply from the lin- 
gual, and from the chorda tympani, a branch 
of the facial, both of which supply nerve- 
filaments to the anterior three-fourths of the 
tongue. This fact, coupled with the involve- 
ment of the sub-maxillary gland, indicates 
that the poison of diphtheria first attacks the 



tongue filaments of the lingual nerve and the 
chorda tympani. 

It is believed that the impediment that 
bars the air from the nerve substance of the 
olfactory, glosso-pharyngeal, chorda-tympani 
and lingual nerves, is no greater than that 
which bars the air from the blood in the 
lungs. Yet gases other than oxygen and 
carbonic acid pass the lung barrier and 
threaten — and at times destroy— the life of 
the body. Among the deadly gases that 
attack the blood from the lungs, is carbonic 
oxide, which, according to Landois, not only 
displaces the oxygen from the red globules, 
but prevents the elimination of carbonic 
acid. 

As the object of this article is to exhibit the 
falsity, as well as the absurdity, of the germ- 
theory, and not to present a new one in its 
place, I will now proceed to add to the evi- 
dence on the lines already laid down. I 
have called attention to the fact that the 
animal chemistry, as well as pathology, of the 
body, gives overwhelming evidence against 
the germ theory. I will now point to the fact 
that all the analogies seen in normal animal 
life, as well as in disease, are opposed to it. 

Fishes live in water as microbes live in the 
morbid secretions of the body; but the fishes 
did not produce the water, were not an ex- 
citing cause in its production, and do not 
poison the water by ptomaines, either of 
secretion or excretion. So pinworms, round 
worms, tapeworms, etc., live and revel in the 
secretions and excretions of the intestinal 
canal, but are not an exciting cause of the 
secretions and excretions, nor do they cause 
any disease by ptomaine or by irritation of 
the nervous system; and yet, while no special 
disease follows, it is probable that one tape- 
worm creates more disturbance in the organ- 
ism of the body than a billion of microbes. 

Now let us look at disease itself. What is 
it, as we see it on the line of practical medi- 
cine ? Here the bacteriologist is dumb! Vet 
it is apparent that a physician must have a 
clear conception of the nature of disease if 
he is to judge accurately of its cause. 

Man is an organism governed by special 
laws that nature has adapted to his needs, — 
laws that relate either to his organic or to his 
animal life, or in other words to life action 
that is normal. This is physiology. Violate

the exciting cause of disease can be wholly 
ignored, I will first call up surgery, where

serious affair than prostration by fever, in 
case the physician knows what fever is and 
puts its treatment on a physiological basis. 
But is any attention paid the exciting cause f 
So. Ordinarily it makes no difference whether 
the fracture came from the kick of a mule, a 
fall from a buggy, or collision with a bicycle; 
the surgeon immediately proceeds to cleanse 
the laceration, secure coaptation of broken 
bone, and apply splints. Now mark that in 
the coaptation of the fragments of bone he 
has restored the normal form and position of 
the bones as levers in the animal economy of 
the body, and has thereby removed the proxi- 
mate cause which stood sponsor for the mor- 
bid anatomy of the soft tissues and the shock 
to the nervous system. 

Again, a man is prostrate and insensible 
from fracture of skull and depression of 
fragment of bone. The exciting cause — a 
blow from a club— cuts no figure at all in 
the surgery of the case; but the proximate 
cause, seen in the depression of bone, is the 
dangerous factor and must be removed. So 
it is when a man has a hard fall, striking 
upon his shoulder and producing a disloca- 
tion. The. fall is the exciting cause, but no 
attention is paid to it. The proximate cause, 
however, is seen in the dislocation, and this 
is removed by replacing the bone; here we 
can see that the proximate cause is the dis- 
ease itself. — This is generally, if not always, 
the case. We call it the proximate cause 
because it stands in direct and close relation 
to the morbid anatomy resulting from it. 

Now turn to practical medicine, where we 



have the acute, epidemic, and chronic dis- 
treated medically. Here, as in 
surgery, the exciting cause is not essential; 
it strikes, and goes, and is lost sight of. No 
matter if this cause exist in the damp atmos- 
phere tli a common cold, or in the 
cold blast that freezes, or in the intense heat 
of summer that masts, and fills our g 

- with the victims of cholera morbus; it 
is all the same — we have no control in the 
premises. The same is true of the exciting 
cause in the epidemics. If we could know 
positively that all these, and even the chronic 
diseases, were produced by microbes, it would 
be of no benefit whatever as to the trea 1 

The two things to know are: What is dis- 
ease? And, how can it be successfully 
treated? Having possession of the knowl- 
edge that these two questions imply, we are 
masters of the situation. Knowing that the 
proximate cause exists, and that it repn 
deranged physiology in which there is a re- 
striction of nerve force, we must restore the 
physiology and thereby remove the disease. 
The means for doing this are as accessible 
and as easy of application as are the surgical 
means for the treatment of fractures, and 
they are as accurate and scientific. 

Here the question may come: Why is it 
that the physiological basis for the treatment 
of disease has not been taught in our medical 
colleges? The reason is that the empirical 
sect, 2300 years ago, attempted to strangle 
physiology in its infancy; and they nearly 
succeeded. Dunglison, in his History of Med- 
icine, tells us that the dogmatists, or foli 
of Hippocrates, never would forgive the em- 
pirics for their opposition to the study of 
anatomy and physiology. The latter branch 
has never fully recovered from that opposi- 
tion, and it never will if the germ theory holds 
sway, for our leading bacteriologists are 
clearly the lineal descendants of the empirical 
charlatans. 

But the world moves. Progress is on the 
wing. Prominent physicians and medical 
journals are renouncing the microbe fallacy, 
and the time is not far distant when the ad- 
vocates of physiological practice will have 
their inning for scientific work. Then th 
medical profession will have a basis for the 
accurate administration of medicine.

OUTLINES OF SANITARY ORGANIZATION 

OF SOME OF THE GREAT ARMIES 

OF THE WORLD. 

BY MAJOR JOHN VAN RENSSELAER HOFF, SUR- 
GEON U. S. ARMY. 

{Continued from page 68g.) 

Owing to the opposition of the General-in- 
Chief, no further steps were taken in this 
direction at this time. In the meantime the 
medical officers in the field had been com- 
pelled to devise the best means they could 
for the immediate care of the wounded after 
battle. At the suggestion of Medical- Di- 
rector Tripler, the following order was issued 
in the Army of the Potomac on October 3d, 
1861: 

Headquarters Army of the Potomac, ) 
Washington, Oct. 3, 1861. J" 

General Order No. 20. 

6. The hospital attendants, to the number 
of ten men to the regiment, and the regi- 
mental bands, will be assembled under the 
supervision of the brigade surgeons, and will 
be drilled one hour each day, except Sunday, 
by regimental medical officers, in setting up 
and dismantling the hand-stretchers, litters, 
and ambulances; in handling men carefully; 
placing them upon the litters and ambulance 
beds; putting them into the ambulances, 
taking them out, etc.; carrying men upon the 
hand-stretchers (observing that the leading 
bearer steps off with the left foot, and the 
rear bearer with the right) ; in short, in every- 
thing that can render this service effective 
and the most comfortable for the wounded 
who are to be transported. 

By command of Major-General McClellan.

Assistant Adjutant-General. 

Similar plans were adopted in other armies, 
but the first and most complete ambulance 
system was that established in August, 1862, 
at the instance of Surgeon Jonathan Letter- 
man, U. S. A., Medical Director of the Army 
of the Potomac. 

The plan is clearly set forth in the accom- 
panying order: 

Headquarters Army of the Potomac, 

Camp near Harrison's Landing, Va., 

August 2, 1862. 

General Order No. 147. 
The following regulations for the organiza- 
tion of the Ambulance Corps and the manage- 
ment of ambulance trains are published for 



the information and government of all con- 
cerned. 

Commanders of army corps will see that 
they are carried into effect without delay: 

1. The ambulance corps will be organized 
on the basis of a captain to each army corps 
as the commandant of the ambulance corps, 
a first lieutenant for a division, second lieu- 
tenant for a brigade, and a sergeant for each 
regiment. 

2. The allowance of ambulances and trans- 
port carts will be: One transport cart, one 
4-horse and two 2-horse ambulances, for a 
regiment; one 2-horse ambulance for each 
battery of artillery; and two 2-horse ambu- 
lances for the headquarters of each army 
corps. Each ambulance will be provided with 
two stretchers. 

3. The privates of the ambulance corps 
will consist of two men and a driver to each 
ambulance, and one driver to each transport 
cart. 

4. The captain is the commander of all the 
ambulances and transport carts in the army 
corps, under the direction of the Medical 
Director. He will pay special attention to 
the condition of the ambulances, horses, 
harness, etc., requiring daily inspections to be 
made by the commanders of division ambu- 
lances, and reports thereof to be made to 
him by these officers. He will make a per- 
sonal inspection once a week of all the am- 
bulances, transport carts, horses, harness, etc., 
whether they have been used for any other 
purpose than the transportation of the sick 
or wounded, and medical supplies; reports of 
which will be transmitted through the Medi- 
cal Director of the Army Corps to the Medi- 
cal Director of the Army every Sunday morn- 
ing. He will institute a drill in his corps, 
instructing his men in the most easy and ex- 
peditious method of putting men in and taking 
them out of the ambulances, taking men 
from the ground and placing and carrying 
them on stretchers, observing that the front 
man steps off with the left foot and the rear 
man with the right, etc. He will be especially 
careful that the ambulances and transport 
carts are at all times in order, provided with 
attendants, drivers, horses, etc., and the keg 
daily rinsed and filled with fresh water, that 
he may be able to move at any moment. 
Previous to and in time of action he will re- 
ceive from the Medical Director of the Army 
Corps his orders for the distribution of the 
ambulances, and the points to which he will 
carry the wounded, using the light two-horse 
ambulances for bringing men from the field. 
and the four-horse ones for carrying those 
already attended to farther to the rear, if the 
Medical Director considers it necessary. He

will give his re- 

moval of the sick and wounded from the field 

and to and from the hospitals, going from 
point to point rtain what may be 

wanted, am: at his subordinates (for 

whose conduct he will be responsible) attend

removing th&lt; as DOSS the 

it; and that the ambulai; 

:i their destination. He will make a full 
and detailed report after every action and 
march, of the operations of the ambulance 
corps. 

5. The first lieutenant assigned to the am- 
bulance corps of a division will have com- 
plete control, under the commander of the 
whole corps and the Medical Director, of all 
the ambulances, transport carts, ambulance 
horses, etc., in the division. He will be the 
acting assistant quartermaster for the division 
ambulance corps, and will receipt and be re- 
sponsible for the property belonging to it, 
and be held responsible for any deficiencies 
in ambulances, transport carts, horses, har- 
ness, etc., pertaining to the ambulance corps 
of the division. He will have a traveling 
cavalry forge, a blacksmith, and a saddler, 

will be under his orders, to enable him 
to keep his train in order. He will receive a 
daily inspection report of all the ambulances, 
horses, etc., under his charge, from the officer 
in charge of brigade ambulance corps, will 
see that the subordinates attend strictly to 
their duties at all times, and will inspect the 
corps under his charge once a week; a report 
of which inspection he will transmit to the 
commander of the ambulance corps. 

6. The second lieutenant in command of 
the ambulances of a brigade will be under 
the immediate orders of the commander of 
the ambulance corps for the division, and 
have superintendence of the ambulance corps 
for the brigade. 

7. The sergeant in charge of the ambulance 
corps for a regiment will conduct the drills, 
inspections, etc., under the orders of the com- 
mander of the brigade ambulance corps, and 
will be particular in enforcing rigidly all 
orders he may receive from his superior 
officers. The officers and non-commissioned 
officers of this corps will be mounted. 

8. The detail for this corps will be made 
with care by commanders of army corps, and 
no officer or man will be selected for this 
duty except those known to be active and 
efficient; and no man will be relieved except 
by orders from these headquarters. Should 
any officer or man detailed for this duty be 
found not fitted for it, representations of the 
fact will be made by the Medical Director of 



the Army (*&lt;&gt;rp-&gt; to the of 

this army. 

I WO met! Tom the reserve 

pfl Of sn:. ich division, and a 

hospital I be with the medi- 

cine wagon, will be detailed by the Medicar 
Director of the Army Corps to accompany 
the ambulance train when on the march, the 
trains of each division being kept together, 
and will see that the sick and wounded are 
properly attended to. A medn gort 

will accompany each train. 

10. The officers connected with the corps 
must be with the trains on the march, observ- 
ing that no one rides in the ambulances with- 
out the authority of the medical office 
except in urgent cases; but men must not 
allowed to suffer, and the officers will, when 
the medical officers cannot be found, use a 
sound discretion in this matter, and be espe- 
cially careful that the men and drivers are 
in their proper places. The place for the 
ambulances is in front of all the wagon trains. 

n. When in camp the ambulances, trans- 
port carts, and ambulance corps will be 
parked with the brigade. They will be used 
on the requisition of the regimental medical 
officers, transmitted to the commander of the 
brigade ambulance corps, for transporting 
the sick to various points and procuring 
medical supplies, and for nothing else. The 
non-commissioned officer in charge will al- 
ways accompany the ambulances or trans- 
port carts when on this or any other duty, 
and he will be held responsible that they are 
used for none other than their legitimate 
purposes. Should any officer infringe upon 
this order, regarding the uses of ambulances, 
etc., he will be reported by the officer or non- 
commissioned officer in charge to the com- 
mander of the train, all the particulars being 
given. 

12. The officers in charge of a train will at 
once remove anything not legitimate, and if 
there be not room for it in the baggage 
wagons of the regiment, will leave it on the 
road. Any attempt by a superior officer to 
prevent him from doing his duty in this or 
any other instance he will promptly report to 
the Medical Director of the Army Corps, who 
will lay the matter before the commander of 
that corps. The latter will, at the earliest 
possible moment, place the officers offending 
in arrest for trial for disobedience of orders. 

13. Good, serviceable horses will be used 
for the ambulances and transport carts, and 
will not be taken for any other purpose, ex- 
cept by orders from these headquarters. 

14. The uniform of this corps is: For pri- 
vates, a green band two inches broad around 
the cap, a green half-chevron two inches

broad on each arm above the elbow, and 
they are to be armed with revolvers. Non- 
commissioned officers to wear the same band 
around the cap as a private, and chevrons 
two inches broad, and green, with the point 
toward the shoulder, on each arm above the 
elbow. 

15. No person will be allowed to carry 
from the field any wounded or sick, except 
this corps. 

16. The commanders of the ambulance 
corps, on being detailed, will report without 
delay to the Medical Director at these head- 
quarters for instructions. All division, bri- 
gade or regimental quartermasters having 
any ambulances, transport carts, ambulance 
horses or harness, etc., in their possession, 
will turn them in at once to the commander 
of the division ambulance corps. 

By command of Major-General McClellan.

Assistant Adjutant-General. 

Thus for the first time in the history of our 
Army was the French system adopted. The 
advantages accruing from this organization 
became speedily manifest. At the battle of 
Antietam, in September, 1862, by the active 
and energetic exertions of the members of 
this corps, the disabled of the right wing of 
the army (there was no ambulance system on 
the left) were rapidly conveyed from the 
scene of conflict to the hospitals in the rear. 
The train of ambulances plied incessantly 
between the battle-ground and the field hos- 
pital. During the night of the battle, all of 
our wounded in the widely extended field 
were removed to shelter and received the 
necessary surgical attention. Different mem- 
bers of the corps behaved with the utmost 
gallantry, passing freely under fire in their 
search for the fallen, and advancing at times 
to the extreme verge of the enemy's pickets. 
All of our wounded having thus been col- 
lected at the temporary depots, such as were 
deemed best able to undergo further trans- 
portation were carefully selected. These, 
during the following two or three days, were 
then conveyed by the ambulance train to 
Frederick City, Md., the nearest point of rail- 
way connections. At the first battle of Fred- 
ericksburg the results of the persevering en- 
deavors of the ambulance corps were not less 
happy. During the night following the bat- 
tle, all of the wounded remaining on the 
ground not absolutely in the hands of the 



enemy were safely conveyed to the city of 
Fredericksburg and its neighborhood. When 
it subsequently became necessary to ev; 
the city of Fredericksburg for military rea- 
sons, the wounded were again placed upon 
the train and safely reached the opposite 
bank of the river. These fortunate results 
were, however, obtained at the expense of 
the ambulance corps, which suffered the loss 
of one officer and several privates killed, 
besides others who were captured during 
their humane efforts to remove their fallen 
countrymen. 

In the Army of the Tennessee, with the 
exception of General Sherman's corps, no 
system for the formation of an ambulance 
train, for confining ambulances to their proper 
use, or for the ready removal of wounded, 
had existed prior to March, 1863, when Med- 
ical Inspector E. P. Vollum, U. S. A., urged 
upon General Grant the necessity of estab- 
lishing an ambulance corps. The proposition 
was cheerfully entertained, and on March 
30th, 1863, the following order was issued 
from the headquarters of the Department of 
the Tennessee: 

Headquarters Department of the Tennessee, )_ 
Young's Point, La., March 30, 'I 

General Order No. 22. 
Army corps commanders will at once en- 
force the following regulations: 

1. All ambulances with the army in the 
field will be turned in to division quarter- 
masters, each division retaining all the am- 
bulances it now has. 

2. Division ambulance trains will be formed 
in charge of one commissioned officer for 
each division, one non-commissioned officer 
for each brigade, and one driver and two 
enlisted men for each ambulance, to be de- 
tailed for that purpose, who will be subject 
to the direction of the chief surgeon of the 
division. 

3. The officers in charge of division ambu- 
lance trains will have direct military control 
over all the non-commissioned officers and 
privates of their respective trains, and will 
see that the ambulances are only used for 
conveying sick or wounded, carrying provi- 
sions for hospitals when necessary, and other 
purposes connected with the relief of sick 
and wounded. 

4. In removing sick and wounded the en- 
listed men detailed to attend ambulances, as 
above directed, will alone be permitted to 
accompany them, and that they may be rec-

Actual experience in the field suggested 
various changes in the original plan adopted 
in the Army of the Potomac, and on August 
2 2d, 1863, Surgeon Letterman laid before the 
General Commanding revised regulations, 
which were published in General Orders No, 
85, Headquarters of the Army of the Potomac, 
August 24th, 1863: 

The following revised regulations for the 
organization of the ambulance corps and the 
management of the ambulance trains are 
published in lieu of Special Orders No. 147, 
Headquarters Army of the Potomac, August 
2d, 1862, for the information and government 
of all concerned. Commanders of army corps 
will see that they are carried into effect: 

1. The army corps is the unit of organiza- 
tion for the ambulance corps, and the latter 
will be organized upon the basis of a captain 
as the commandant of the corps, one first 
lieutenant for each division, one second lieu- 
tenant for each brigade, one sergeant for 
each regiment. 

2. The privates of this corps will consist 
of two men and one driver to each ambulance, 
and one driver to each medicine wagon. 

3. The two-horse ambulances only will be 
used, and the allowance until further orders 
to each corps will be upon the basis of three 
to each regiment of infantry, two to each 
regiment of cavalry, one to each battery of 
artillery (to which it will be permanently at- 
tached), and two to the headquarters of each 
army corps; and two army wagons to each 
division. Each ambulance will be provided 
with two stretchers. 

4. The captain is the commander of all the 
ambulances, medicine and other wagons in 
the corps, under the immediate direction of 
the medical director of the army corps to 



which the ambulai He will 

pay special attention to the condition of the 
ambulantt OS, horses, harness, etc., 

and see that t: I all times in readiness 

rvice, that the officers and men are 

properly instructed in their duties, and that 

I that the reg- 
ulations of the ^re strictly adhe&lt; 
by those under his command. He will insti- 
tute a drill in his corps, instructing his men 
in the m&lt; ditious method of 
putting men in and taking them out of the 
ambulances, lifting th I l uind, 
and placing and carrying them on stret* 
in the la' ing that the front 
man steps off with the left foot and the rear 
man with the right, etc., — that in all cases 
his men treat the sick and wounded with 
gentleness and care; that the ambulances 
and wagons are at all times provided with 
attendants, drivers, horses, etc.; that the ves- 
sels for carrying water are constantly kept 
clean and filled with fresh water; that the 
ambulances are not used for any other pur- 
pose than that for which they are designed 
and ordered. Previous to the march he will 
receive from the medical director of the army 
corps his orders for the distribution of the 
ambulances for gathering up the sick, and 
previous to and in time of action he will re- 
ceive orders from the same officer where to 
send his ambulances, and to what points the 
wounded are to be carried. He will give his 
personal attention to the removal of the sick 
and wounded from the field in time of action, 
going from place to place to ascertain what 
may be wanted, to see that his subordinates 
(for whose conduct he will be responsible) 
attend faithfully to their duties in taking 
care of the wounded and removing them as 
quickly as may be found consistent with their 
safety to the field hospitals, and see that the 
ambulances reach their destination. After 
every battle he will make a report, in detail, 
of the operations of his corps, to the medical 
director of the army corps to which he be- 
longs, who will transmit a copy with such 
remarks as he may deem proper to the Medi- 
cal Director of this army. He will give his 
personal attention to the removal of the sick 
when they are required to be sent to general 
hospitals, or to other points as may be or- 
dered. He will make a personal inspection 
at least once a month of everything pertain- 
ing to the ambulance corps, a report of which 
will be made to the medical director of the 
corps, who will transmit a copy to the Medi- 
cal Director of this army. This inspection 
will be minute and made with care, and will 
not supersede the constant supervision which 
he must at all times exercise over his corps. 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 



713 



He will also make a weekly report according 
to the prescribed form to the same officer, 
who will forward a copy to the Medical Di- 
rector of this army. 

5. The first lieutenant assigned to the am- 
bulance corps for a division will have com- 
plete control, under the captain of his corps 
and the medical director of the army corps, 
of all the ambulances, medical and other 
wagons, horses, etc., and men in that portion 
of the ambulance corps. He will be the 
acting assistant- quartermaster for that portion 
of the corps, and will receipt for and be re- 
sponsible for all the property belonging to it, 
and be held responsible for any deficiency in 
anything appertaining thereto. He will have 
a traveling cavalry forge, a blacksmith, and 
a saddler, who will be under his orders, to 
enable him to keep his train in order. His 
supplies will be drawn from the depot quar- 
termaster upon requisitions approved by the 
captain of his corps and the commander of 
the army corps to which he is attached. He 
will exercise a constant supervision over his 
train in every particular, and keep it at all 
times ready lor service. Especially before a 
battle will he be careful that everything be 
in order. The responsible duties devolving 
upon him in time of action render it neces- 
sary that he be active and vigilant, and spare 
no labor in their execution. He will make 
reports to the captain of the corps, upon the 
form prescribed, every Saturday morning. 

6. The second lieutenant will have com- 
mand of the portion of the ambulance corps 
for a brigade, and will be under the imme- 
diate orders of the commander of the ambu- 
lance for a division, and the injunctions in 
regard to care and attention and supervision 
prescribed for the commander of the division 
he will exercise in that portion under his 
command. 

7. The sergeant will conduct drills, inspec- 
tions, etc., under the orders and supervision 
of the commander of the ambulances for a 
brigade, be particular in enforcing all orders 
he may receive from his superior officers, and 
that the men are attentive to their duties. 
The officers and non-commissioned officers 
will be mounted. The non-commissioned of- 
ficers will be armed with revolvers. 

8. Two medical officers and two hospital 
stewards will be detailed daily by roster by 
the surgeon-in-chief of the division, to ac- 
company the ambulances for the division 
when on the march, whose duties will be to 
attend to the sick and wounded with the am- 
bulances and see that they are properly cared 
for. No man will be permitted by any line 
officer to fall to the rear to ride in the ambu- 
lances unless he has written permission from 



the senior medical officer of his regiment to 
do so. These passes will be carefully pre- 
served, and at the close of march be trans- 
mitted by the senior medical officer with the 
train, with such remarks as he may deem 
proper, to the surgeon-in-chief of his division. 
A man who is sick or wounded, who requires 
to be carried in an ambulance, will not be re- 
jected; should he not have the permission 
required, the surgeon of the regiment who 
has neglected to give it will be reported at 
the close of the march by the senior surgeon 
with the train, to the surgeon-in-chief of his 
division. 

When on the march, one-half the privates 
of the ambulance corps will accompany on 
foot the ambulances to which they belong, to 
render such assistance as may be required. 
The remainder will march in the rear of their 
respective commands, to conduct, under the 
orders of the medical officers, such men as 
may be unable to proceed to the ambulances, 
or who may be incapable of taking proper 
care of themselves, until the ambulances come 
up. When the case is of so serious a nature 
as to require it, the surgeon of the regiment 
or his assistant will remain and deliver the 
man to one of the medical officers with the 
ambulances. At all other times the privates 
will be with their respective trains. 

The medicine wagons will on the march be 
in their proper places in the rear of the am- 
bulances for each brigade. 

Upon ordinary marches the ambulances 
and wagons belonging to the train will follow 
immediately in the rear of the division to 
which it is attached. Officers connected with 
the corps must be with the trains when on 
the march, observing that no one rides in 
any of the ambulances except by authority 
of medical officers. Every necessary facility 
for taking care of the sick and wounded upon 
the march will be afforded the medical offi- 
cers by the officers of the ambulance corps. 

9. When in camp the ambulances will be 
parked by division. The regular roll-calls, 
reveille, retreat and tattoo will be held, at 
which at least one commissioned officer will 
be present and receive the reports. Stable 
duty will be at hours fixed by the captain of 
the corps, and at this time, while the drivers 
are in attendance upon their animals, the 
privates will be employed in keeping the 
ambulances to which .they belong, in order, 
keeping the vessels for carrying water tilled 
with fresh water, and in general police duties. 

Should it become necessary for a regi- 
mental medical officer to use one or more am- 
bulances for transporting sick and wounded, 
he will make a requisition upon the com- 
mander of the ambulances for a division, who

EMASCULATION AND OVARIOTOnY AS A 

PENALTY FOR CRIME AND AS A 

REFORMATORY AGENCY. 

BY A. C. CORK, M.I). 

A year ago the Illinois State Society had a 
symposium, as it were, on the mode of pun- 
ishing, reforming, and "executing" criminals, 
so as to best subserve the purposes of justice 
and protect society. But it was apparent the 
members were not in a mood to give the time 



to the that the importance ot the 

theme demanded. Two &lt;&gt;!" th &gt; pre- 

sented were moderate ID tone — one being 
devoted t»&gt; the "Mode of Executing Crimi- 
nals," the other suggesting education and 
reclamation as more humane and philan- 
thropic, while equally well ciety; 
while a third proposed the somewhat remark- 
if emasculation and ovariotomy, 
not only as a penalty for crime, but as a means 
for the reformation of criminals. The propo- 
sition was discussed under nine considerations, 
the first two of which are as follow 

We are taught by both physiology and psychol- 
ogy that human beings arc controlled in their con- 
duct, and actions and appetencies are 
through their organic instincts. Of th&lt; 
of paramount importance. They are: the love of 
life, and sexual love. The first is from birth to 
death always in active operation in preserving the 
individual from the various accidents and diseases 
which tend to deprive him of life. It is the strong- 
est, and outlasts all other organic instincts. NYxt 
to this is the love of sex. It dominates human con- 
duct and desires. Its bestowal was for a wise and 
beneficent purpose, but when uncontrolled it is 
potent for evil. 

The greater portion of the crimes characteristic 
of the criminal and vicious classes ma)- be traced 
directly and indirectly to the influence of this un- 
controlled and dominating sexual love. The rapes, 
homicides, suicides, defalcations and embezzle- 
ments may be ascribed either directly to sexual 
love, or to the influences associated with it. So 
well is this understood that when we hear of the 
cashier of a bank absconding with its funds, or a 
trusted clerk robbing his employer and betraying 
his confidence, almost the first comment heard is: 
"Oh, there is a woman in the case." With 
an exception, there are few vices in the calendar of 
crime, licentiousness, prostitution, intemperance, 
gambling, and others that are nameless, that are 
not designed, associated witli and maintained by 
sexual love. 

I confess there is a glamor of plausibility 
in the conclusions implied in these two con- 
siderations. But is it true that all criminals 
are instigated and dominated by love of the 
opposite sex 5 I confess to an incredulity in 
the mere assertion that physiology and psy- 
chology teach such. This may be all there is 
in the conduct of the individual who has 
little or no inhibiting intellectuality, and if 
those sciences are studied with strong ego- 
istic and introspective bias such a conclu- 
sion may be reached, but certainly in the vast 
majority of individuals in society these two

so-called dominating instincts do not exercise 
paramount control. Personally I have been 
brought in contact with several criminals who 
were not licentious, and likewise with many 
licentious persons who are not otherwise 
criminals. 

I recall that within the past twenty-five 
years 2,500,000 men offered their lives, with 
all else that was sacred, and the deprivation 
of the mere gratification of sexual love, as a 
willing sacrifice to their country's perpetuity 
and its sacred institutions. Surely they were 
not dominated by the mere selfish instincts 
of love of life or love of sex. It is said, as a 
rejoinder, that they were not of the criminal 
class; true, they were not, but a proportion 
of them were, and such found no gratifica- 
tion of love of life or love of sex on the 
battle-field; and the whole of the 1,500,000 
who opposed them were offering and sacri- 
ficing as much for the perpetuity of a crime. 
So I think it is not without question that those 
two so-called dominating instincts always ac- 
tuate and dictate the conduct of an individual, 
even though he be a criminal. 

The next consideration presented in the 
paper referred to is as follows: 

The physical or structural characteristics of the 
criminal and defective classes are produced, repro- 
duced, and multiplied and perpetuated, by inter- 
marriage or sexual commerce of persons of like 
defects, and we have accordingly the results of the 
activities of living matter, or what is called hered- 
ity. 

The phrase "defective classes," in this con- 
sideration, is a redeeming feature of it, for 
certainly criminals are morally defective in 
the abstract sense. But is it true that so 
large a proportion of the criminal class as is 
implied is the result of heredity, strictly 
speaking — the offspring of criminal progeni- 
tors? That the defect, moral imbecility, is 
congenital in all and tnherited by many, is, I 
think, beyond question. The criminal defect 
is often a mental complex, a by-product of 
apparently normal mental conditions of an- 
cestors, neither of whom was criminally 
inclined. To have been inherited, it must 
be a like trait to that which was exhibited in 
the ancestors, one or both. I am acquainted 
with the Harry Hayward family on both 
sides; they were not criminals. I am ac- 
quainted with a Methodist minister who was 



a presiding elder; he and his wife are amiable 
people, above reproach; yet their two 
are both criminals. Some families are all 
criminals but one, and where is the flock with- 
out a black sheep? 

As I have said, the criminal tendency is a 
mental complex, a moral imbecility, con- 
genital or hereditary, but in either respect 
largely the result of environment and syn- 
ergistic influences. Probably more of this 
synergistic influence is manufactured in the 
neighborhood of Peoria than anywhere else; 
and in speaking of environment I am im- 
pelled to ask: What is crime? Certainly 
some crimes are geographical and others are 
municipal. There is certainly much in the 
education of people that relates to the per- 
petuation of crime. 

Our next "consideration" reads as follows: 

By the imposition of this penalty — emasculation 
and ovariotomy — we destroy the capabilities of 
these defective criminal classes to inflict injury 
upon society, thus depriving them of the power of 
reproduction. This ... is one of the strong- 
est considerations in favor of the proposed penalty. 
It has an immediate and far-reaching effect. 

As far as the intent of the above is con- 
cerned, I have little to say, only that it would 
have, no doubt, a good influence as far as 
the hereditary defect in criminality is con- 
cerned, but to the congenital class it could 
not be applied primarily. Secondarily, many 
of the former would not transmit their own 
defects, nor would all the hereditary traits 
be transmitted; some good has come out of 
Nazareth. 

For the purpose of intimidating others from the 
commission of crime, while neither cruel nor vin- 
dictive, it is more terrifying and repulsive, next to 
death, than any or all modes of punishment. The 
loss of sexual capability as a mark of manhood is 
so utterly abhorrent to all men that it would be 
avoided if possible by all individuals not hopelessly 
insane. 

What data have we that the mere loss of 
sexual capabilities is so abhorrent that all 
persons not hopelessly insane would avoid 
it? Certainly in the absence of such data, 
personal ego-introspection is all the basis for 
any such conclusion. The technique of 
emasculation would be a punishment, no 
doubt, which all would shrink from, but 
whether it would be abhorrent enough to 



16 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 



prevent crime other than raj 
without more data. I have known individu- 
als anxious to have the operation performed; 
I knew one case where it was performed by 
the individual himself; h .ere 

it was chin. performed by others for 

revenge, i id the Oriental eunuchs 

are all the instances ire sept the 

modern castration for enlarged prostate. 
From this, it on criminality and crime 

cannot he judged, except that it would in all 
probability prevent the repetition of rape. 

That loss lal capability is abhorrent 

to aged men, is made manifest by the fact 
that many times they appear much more con- 
cerned about senile impotence than about 
the mental degeneracy that accompanies it. 
The phraseology of this 4&gt; consideration " 
makes it apply only to men, but I infer from 
the original proposition that women should 
be included. During a large part of their 
lives, sexual capability is of no consequence 
to women, and is totally disregarded — in fact, 
sexual commerce is abhorrent and disgust- 
ing; and the bearing of offspring is at most 
times undesired by all, and beyond doubt 
abhorrent to the criminal class. 

The sixth consideration presented is: 

In ansezing all constitutionally depraved con- 
victs, the most important of all results is reached, 
the limitation of the productive capabilities of this 
class, thus aiding natural selection, and insuring if 
extensively applied the survival of the fittest. 

is admitted, as far as it would curtail 
production, but if the criminal so punished is 
left at large, is it sure he would not prey on 
society in all crimes except the repetition of 
rape? If emasculation and ovariotomy as a 
punishment for criminality, vice, and immo- 
rality, will so change the vicious traits and 
immorality of the individual as is intimated 
in this proposition, I am sure we have a sug- 
gestion of a new theory of morals, to say the 
least of it. Does emasculation stimulate the 
moral sense ': 

In reference to the Mohammedan eunuchs 
— the pith of the next argument adduced — is 
it not a custom in Turkey, a fashion ? And 
do they not ask for emasculation as a means 
of place and pay ? Are they not slaves? 

The truth of the foregoing cited considera- 
tions, I claim, is not so entirely self-evident 
as is implied. To say the least, they are not 



wholly true. Would not emasculation &lt;■ 

ill, and would not the criminal 
• equally hard to evade it by litig 

methods? It \\ rrect, the eighth "con- 

sideration " also colla; 

To the general statement as to range of 
application of the punishment, to the l 
that it might be safely applied to insane per- 
sons, cranks, monomaniacs, and cases of 
paranoia — which constitutes the final pl( 
the paper we are considering, — 1 have only 
to reply: Would it change their delusions and 
make them safe citizens at large in society 
an experimental treatment I should not ob- 
ject, but until sufficient of such data is 
gathered to assure safety. I think it not best 
to castrate them and turn them lo&lt; 

I cordially agree with that part of the 
proposition as suggested by Doctor Agnew, 
of Philadelphia, that emasculation be applied 
as a punishment — precautionary — for rape, 
because one who has such a perverted im- 
pulse should, for the safety of society, be 
rendered unable to commit the deed in- 
volved. 

But, gentlemen, this is not the most hein- 
ous of crimes growing out of the relation of 
the sexes. Far more infamous is that of 
seduction. He who would ingratiate him- 
self into the affections of a young lady or a 
girl to seduce her, is as much mo?-e guilty of 
crime than the rapist, as the highway robber 
who plans the murder of his victim is more 
guilty than he who, through impulse of sud- 
den provoked anger, strikes his victim down 
by a single blow.

CHLORAL AND IPECAC IN LABOR. 

BY X. C. MITRA, M.A., M.B. 

The uses of chloral in labor have been 
dilated upon by many accoucheurs, and Doc- 
tor Playfair in his standard work especially 
has laid great stress on the advanta,L&gt; 
using it in the first stage. 

In cases where the os is rigid, undilatable, 
and the uterus firmly contracted, chloral acts 
like a charm. Two doses, of fifteen grains 
each, at intervals of half an hour, are fol- 
lowed by very beneficial results; the patient 
goes to sleep, and when she awakes the os is 



THE MEDICAL AGE.

forced and dilated, when delivery may be 
completed in a very short time. Playfair 
insists on its use in those cases where, in 
addition to the rigidity of the os, the uterus is 
spasmodically contracted. That is exactly 
the case where the waters have long escaped, 
the arm presents, the uterus is firmly con- 
tracted, and the os so rigid that two fingers 
cannot be passed by the side of the present- 
ing part. It is all very well to suggest various 
other remedies, but the circumstances of the 
seclusion of an Indian zenana must be borne 
in mind. It may strike the reader as some- 
thing very unusual that male accoucheurs (or 
medical men) are never even consulted in 
midwifery cases in India, unless something 
serious turns up, and then the medical man 
is simply consulted, and by no means allowed 
to examine the private parts. It thus becomes 
a serious matter for an accoucheur, when con- 
sulted in such emergencies, to prescribe drugs 
that will have most pronounced effect. Barnes 
dilators are good in their way in facilitating 
dilatation of a rigid os, but one can hardly 
expect to find such instruments in outlying 
stations. Chloroform, moreover, is objected 
to by many, and it tends to diminish uterine 
action, which is not desirable in the first stage 
of labor; moreover, I have found chloral far 
more useful. In one instance, where the arm 
presented within a rigid os, I could not find 
any relaxation after chloroforming the pa- 
tient; and it was only after a warm hip-bath 
and the administration of antimonial wine 
that dilatation was secured. In two other cases 
of arm presentation the uterus was firmly 
contracted, the foetus dead, and the os rigid, 
when two doses of fifteen grains of chloral, 
given twenty minutes apart, in an hour's time 
brought about dilatation, when the foetus 
delivered by turning. Thus we have a use- 
ful agent in chloral in facilitating relaxation 
of a rigid os, and its use ought to be extended. 

Ipecac is an oxytocic; though this fact is 
rarely mentioned in works devoted to ob- 
stetric medicine, it has been long recognized 
by medical practitioners in India. When 
uterine pains are dull and labor not progress- 
ing favorably, the rule is to give three to 
four grains of powdered ipecac. 

In the Therapeutic Gazette for January, 
1893, Doctor H. Stillmark reports a confine- 
ment case in which he made a most success- 



ful trial of wine of ipecac — two or three 
doses, of ten to fifteen drops each. This, to 
my mind, is too small a dose to produce any 
decided effect on labor. We in India re- 
peatedly observe the pains become stronger 
immediately after administering ipecac, when 
delivery is effected within a short time. It is 
still a question whether ipecac has any direct 
action on the muscular fibres of the uterus, 
akin to that of ergot, and were such a fact it 
would seem as if the use of wine of ipecac 
for relief of bronchitis in advanced preg- 
nancy would be followed by premature labor. 
I believe ipecac produces nauseating sensa- 
tion, and thus indirectly produces relaxation 
of the os and contraction of the uterus; that 
this is so, is evident from the effect induced 
when one employs antimonial wine. There 
is, moreover, among parturient females of 
Bengal, a curious custom which suggests the 
role of ipecac (I do not know whether this 
obtains among European females): If the 
pains are not strong, the patient or her 
friend places a bunch of her hair into her 
mouth, which necessarily produces nausea, 
when an indirect action is brought to bear 
upon the uterine fibres. To produce this 
effect, larger doses than ten to fifteen drops 
of ipecac must be used — three to five grains 
of powdered, equivalent to about one to ten 
drachms of the wine, may be given.

AMYLACEOUS INDIGESTION, AND ITS 
TREATMENT BY TAKA=DIASTASE. 

BY R. CO WAX LEES, M.B., F.F.P.S.* 

There is no complaint so common as indi- 
gestion, and few diseases have received so 
much attention; therefore it is needless on 
my part to do more than simply to tell of the 
good results that have been obtained from 
the judicious use of Taka-Diastase in the 
treatment of amylaceous dyspepsia. 

I cannot, however, begin to discuss the 
merits of any medicine without, in the first 
place, emphasizing the great necessity of a 
proper dietary, and showing how, in books 
published upon the dieting of special diseases,

the g: st m the food combina- 

tions recommended. 

ng time my be! that indi- 

purcly a disturbance of the 

LCD function, and that the only method 

I suitable dose of pepsin, with 

or without the addition of acids or alkalies 

rding to the apparent nee- &gt;\ the 

cperience has taught that the 

cause — indeed, in nearly nine cases out 

of ten — lies in the careless manner in which 

the hydrocarbons are hurriedly passed into 

the stomach without being acted upon by the 

ptyalin of the secretions of the mouth. 

Recently I met in consultation one of our 
leading physicians, who, in order to lessen 
the slight diarrhoea which beef-tea was pro- 
ducing, recommended some amylaceous food 
to thicken it; but on drawing his attention to 
the fact that in such cases the starchy food 
was conveyed into the stomach without carry- 
ing with it its necessary quantity of ptyalin, 
combined or uncombined, he at once stated 
that he had never thought of it in that way. 

Now I am anxious to impress upon my 
readers the fact that, at the present day, too 
much amylaceous food is taken into the 
stomach soaked with tea, coffee, cocoa, milk, 
beef-tea, or other fluids, without the slightest 
consideration being given to the great neces- 
sity of the action of the ptyalin. 

The stomach will only continue the action 
commenced in the mouth for a period of 
about half an hour or slightly more, but it 
will not originate it; therefore all the greater 
care should be taken to ensure complete 
mastication and admixture of all starchy 
foods with the mouth-juice before swallow- 
ing. 

When one thinks of the large, number of 
patients who constantly soak starchy foods 
with fluids, it is not difficult to arrive at the 
conclusion that by far the greatest number 
of cases of indigestion are what may be 
termed amylaceous dyspepsia. 

That the indigestion of starchy food is the 
true cause of many other diseases, I have no 
hesitation in saying, for I have carefully 
watched this both in adult and infantile life; 
but I need not further refer to this here, as 
it is my intention to discuss the action of 
such resulting ptomaines in another paper; 
I will only say I regard the ptomaines of 



h (amulon-ptomaine) as 
being almost as injurious to the human body 
as the ptomaines of nitrogenous 

The ingestion of malt extract gives great 
relief in many if amylaceous ind 

tion, but with some persons it causes un- 
bearable biliousness, due no doubt to the 
too sudden ai irption of glu- 

cose, which is absorbed by the stomach; 
therefore, in the great majority of cases 
which come before me I am compelled I 
very careful in my recommendation of it. 

The ordinary diastase of commerce has 
little or no amylolytic action, for in an ex- 
periment which I carried through, with a 
sample procured from a good wholesale 
house, it required nearly forty grains to do 
that which one grain of Taka- Diastase did 
in less time. The first cost of Taka-Dia 
may appear to many as a great hindrance to its 
use, but when its powerful amylolytic action, 
as against ordinary diastase, is taken into 
account, the verdict is in favor of the former, 
and success in the treatment of such cases as 
are under discussion here becomes an ac- 
complished fact. 

The regulations as to diet, which I advise 
to patients for the first week or two, are very 
peremptory. They must not use fluids of 
any kind whilst masticating amylaceous food, 
and are restricted from the too free use of 
tea, soups with vegetables, etc. 

Soon the improvement becomes so evident 
that the patient is quite willing to pursue this 
method of treatment. 

Tea, I am inclined to believe the greatest 
defaulter; not that it is injurious in itself, 
but because it is generally taken along with 
amylaceous food in order to soak it and 
make it more easily masticated. Thus the 
inactive tea, so far as the digestion of starch 
is concerned, usurps the place, in mastica- 
tion and the formation of the bolus, which 
the active mouth-juice should occupy, with 
the result that that which should be passed 
into the stomach either in a digested or 
rapidly digesting condition (the latter to be 
finished in the stomach) is swallowed in a 
state in which it cannot be digested before 
the acid stage of digestion sets m. 

Soups with vegetables I place second, 
though in Scotland, where it is the custom to 
take puddings with milk or cream, this form

of food is equally injurious, because here 
again the starch is passed directly into the 
stomach without being altered into maltose 
as it ought to be. 

The introduction of Taka-Diastase I look 
upon as of far greater moment in the treat- 
ment of indigestion as met with in every-day 
practice, than that of pepsin, but we are only 
at the experimental stage as to the beneficial 
effects of this new digestive ferment, and I 
hope that other medical men may have the 
same good results from its use as those with 
which I have been favored. 

As acid digestion is believed to commence 
from half to three-quarters of an hour after 
eating, Taka-Diastase, to be of greatest bene- 
fit, should be taken, in one- to five-grain 
doses, either immediately before or after 
meals.

EXTRAUTERINE PREGNANCY; UNDEVEL= 

OPED UTERUS AND EPILEPSY; ANAL 

FISSURE AND RECTAL PRO= 

LAPSE.* 

BY EDWARD W. JENKS, M.D. 

Case i. — This patient, aged 22, and unmar- 
ried, was, by her own confession, the victim 
of a dissolute life; had had repeated abor- 
tions, the last three months previous to her 
appearance at the clinic; also several attacks 
of gonorrhoea, of which due evidence ap- 
peared in the glands of Bartholin, in the dis- 
charge from the uterus, and characteristic 
symptoms of tubal and ovarian disorders. 
Examination revealed upon the right side of 
the uterus, involving the tube and ovary of 
that side, a tumor, apparently the size of a 
large orange; and upon the left side the 
ovary and tube adherent and painful to the 
touch, but without positive evidence of pus. 
This girl having had gonorrhoea, it might be 
assumed her condition was wholly the result 
of gonorrhceal infection. 

On opening the abdomen I found adhe- 
sions agglutinating all the pelvic organs, 
which I separated carefully and yet as rapidly 
as possible; then ligated the pedicle of the 
tumor on the right side of uterus, close to 
cornu. The tumor included the right ovary 
and Fallopian tube. The left ovary and

tube, after being freed fr&lt; m 
proved to be without evidence of gonorrhoea] 
infection, hence were not further moli 
As there was considerable bleeding, the ab- 
dominal cavity was washed out with hot water 
and the abdominal wound closed in the usual 
manner. 

The tumor removed proved to be, as sus 
pected, an encysted foetus, about the third 
month of pregnancy. I had no means of 
knowing when this woman became preg- 
nant — it may have been six months or a year 
before, as it was impossible to glean from 
her any definite knowledge. It is evident, 
however, from the appearance of the speci- 
men, that foetal development was arrested 
some time ago, as it showed signs of disin- 
tegration. 

Three weeks after the patient was operated 
upon, she appeared in good health and un- 
mistakably in a much better physical condi- 
tion than when she first presented herself to 
me. Her history since the operation, how- 
ever, has been in some respects remarkable, 
and in my experience quite unique. She was 
one of the most unmanageable of patients. 
Six hours after the operation, there being no 
indications of surgical shock, a saline cathar- 
tic was administered. Early the following 
morning the nurse discovered her sitting 
upon the edge of the bed, having previously 
been walking about the room; and when 
asked why she was up, she gave the reply 
that she must go. to the closet, as her bowels 
were about to move. It was only through 
considerable persuasion and some physical 
effort that she was induced to use the bed- 
pan; and it was only by threats of a strait- 
jacket that she was kept from getting up 
and walking about the room during the next 
two days. I afterwards learned there was 
not a day since the second one following the 
operation, when the nurses were out of the 
ward, that she was not up and walking about. 
Two weeks later she dressed herself and 
went out to church, four blocks away. The 
remarkable feature of the case is, that with 
the exception of a few hours of discomfort 
following the operation, there has been no 
disturbance of function or elevation of tem- 
perature, as at no time did the thermometer 
indicate ioo° F. 

Case 2. — Miss D , aged 20, was a con- 
stant and regular attendant at the clinic for 
a year. She appeared physically well devel- 
oped; mamma? and external organs of gen- 
eration presented nothing abnormal; vagina 
of normal length, but the uterus was rudi- 
mentary merely, being less than one inch in 
length.

— bromides and kindred remedies 
seemed to aggravate rather than diminish 
any of the symptoms; she had even been sub- 
jected to nerve-stretching. It is apparent 
she never derived any benefit from the vari- 
ous modes of treatment prescribed. The 
opinion of several of my colleagues, in which 
I somewhat reluctantly concurred, was that 
the fans et origo of the convulsions and the 
other nervous symptoms was seated in the 
generative organs, and that, since every mode 
of treatment had been futile, exploratory 
cceliotomy was advisable. 

When 1 finally opened the abdomen, I found 
the right ovary of the size of a pullet's egg, 
presenting the white glistening appearance 
of an ovarian cyst. This I removed. The 
left ovary was somewhat larger, but of the 
same general appearance. The operation 
was unattended by difficulties, and the pa- 
tient exhibited no signs of shock. On incision 
of the right ovary I was unable to discover 
normal stroma or any vestige of a Graafian 
follicle. In the left ovary, however, was a 
single corpus luteum, corresponding to the 
single time she had menstruated. 

It is my belief that this girl never had 
normal, healthy ovaries, and that the cystic 
degeneration was of pre-natal origin. I con- 
sider the pathological condition fully justified 
the operation. 

Four months after operation she presented 
an appearance of health, with clear skin and 
bright eyes; her speech was no longer hesi- 
tating, and she walked firmly without a hitch 
or a halt; had not had a single convulsion, and 
the only indication of her former trouble was 
in the hand, no longer disabled and useless, 
but, under nervous excitement or fatigue, ex- 
hibiting slight spasmodic contraction, which 
will probably disappear with time. 

Case j. — When this patient came before 
me she was nursing a child six weeks old, 



ami consequently was hardly a first class 
l surgical operation. She was 
suffering from prolapsus and a haemorrfa 

condition of the rectum, of son. 

m g. greatly aggravated by pregnancy and 

parturition; after her confinement the S&lt; 
spasmodic pain follow 

indicative of ana . and the rectum, 

which formerly protruded an inch and a half, 
now descended further with every movement 
of the bowels— involving, however, only the 
mucous and none of the muscular structure. 

First I paralyzed the external sphincter 
with my thumbs; then operated by making a 
superficial cut in which to imbed the sutures 
through the skin at its junction with the 
mucous membrane, — then ligated the pro- 
lapsed mass in four sections. As I inserted 
the double-threaded needle from the integu- 
mentary side through the first section, the 
assistant dragged down as much of the mu- 
cous membrane as had been prolapsed, that it 
might be embraced within the tightened lig- 
ature. The remaining sections were treated 
in the same manner. I made this operation 
instead of Whitehead's or any other of those 
recently devised, because I universally obtain 
better results thereby ; with other surgical 
procedures, stricture of rectum is liable to 
occur. 

Four weeks later the condition of the 
patient was eminently satisfactory in every 
way. The parts had healed perfectly, the 
prolapsed rectum was no longer apparent, 
and defalcation was entirely painless.

A GOOD THING. 

Editor Medical Age: 

It is not often that a child invents anything 
of interest to surgeons and surgery; but here 

is one. My little friend, Miss Queenie I) , 

twelve years old, having fractured both bones 
of the forearm through the middle third, was 
very desirous of getting back to school, but 
the dressings on the injured arm prevented 
her wearing a waist. She therefore asked 
her mother to make her a dress like the well 
known "Mother Hubbard," altering it so 
that, instead of opening on the back or front, 
as customary, it would open on the side of 
the neck corresponding to the injured arm, 
the opening extending outward to the shoul- 
der tip and down the outside of the sleeve to

the wrist. The underwear was modified in 
the same way, a few hooks and eyes holding 
it in place. 

The ease with which these garments can 
be removed and replaced is surprising, and 
the little one easily dresses herself without 
assistance. A wide collar or small cape con- 
ceals the opening on the shoulder. She 
asserts, and I am prepared to accept her 
opinion, that almost any waist can be so 
modified "without injuring it a bit."

THE HEDICAL AGE 

A SEH1-MONTHLY REVIEW OF HEDICINE. 



THE WOODBRIDGE TREATMENT. 

Editor Medical Age: 

I have been engaged in the practice of 
medicine for twenty- three years, and the 
treatment for typhoid when I entered the 
ranks was that devised by George B. Wood, 
of Philadelphia; but I have been employing, 
latterly, the Woodbridge treatment, and with 
most satisfactory results. I find that it -pre- 
vents the patient passing into the condition 
of low muttering delirium, with tympanitic 
bowels, dry skin, and brown, cracked tongue, 
followed in many instances by violent haem- 
orrhages and death — even should the patient 
live, he is for weeks in the "valley and 
shadow of death." 

In his presidential address before the Iowa 
State Medical Society in 1891, Doctor Middle- 
ton truthfully remarked: "One of our most 
common disorders is typhoid fever, but its 
proper prevention is so manifestly in hygienic 
directions of the plainest sort that the Eng- 
lish sanitarian says some one ought to be 
hanged whenever a case develops; but let it 
once lay hold on an individual, and charac- 
teristic ulceration of Peyer's patches begins. 
All know the many and discouraging days 
and weeks that follow till, with mouth open, 
and eyes that have no speculation in them, 
the patient lies all but moribund. And you 
know that cures would be welcome, since pre- 
vention has failed." This, from the gifted 
pen of one of the ablest clinicians in the 
West, gives the exact status of the treatment 
of typhoid. 

I would say to the physician who has not 
given the Woodbridge treatment a full and 
fair trial, that he should do so at once; and 
I personally believe Woodbridge's name will 
go down into medical history alongside the 
names of McDowell, Sims, Morton, and the 
host of others who have dared to become 
originators and reformers. 

Fraternally yours,

THE TREATriENT OF PHTHISIS. 

In no disease of the nosology is routine 
treatment so unqualified an evil as in phthi- 
sis, inasmuch as therapeusis is generally 
based upon title rather than upon clinical 
manifestations and demands. Even those 
methods, the efficacy of which is undoubted, 
should be limited by the peculiarities of the 
malady induced by individualism. 

In Europe, fashion has proclaimed moun- 
tain-climbing to be of benefit, inasmuch as it 
provides rarefied air and promises increased 
rapidity and volume of the circulation, ex- 
pansion of the pulmonary apparatus, and 
exposure of a greater surface to the influence 
of the oxygen of the atmosphere, whereby 
morbid products may be in greater degree 
consumed. Unfortunately, however, fashion 
is apt to be a routine prescriber, on the 
hither as well as the further side of the 
Atlantic, and in the United States the com- 
mand to go to California or Colorado has its 
errors emphasized in the cold portrayal of 
tombstones against the blue outline of the 
landscape; and such is the stern monition 
offered by every so-called health r esort 
whether of high or low altitude, since com- 
mon sense should teach there is no royal 
road to relief from any malady, and no uni- 
versal panacea for consumption, not even in 
increased or diminished oxygen. 

Recently Doctor Volland, of Davos-Platz,* 
scored what he terms " stereotyped therapeu- 
tics," and in so doing paid particular atten-

tion to mountain-clin. 1 hydropathy. 

He rightfully insists the former is to b&lt; 
ommended with the greatest caution, and 

that "if it results in do positive harm in 
eight cases out of ten, the remaining two are 
with certainty injured." The same is equally 
true of the cold-water treatment — few con- 
sum; i - ear the shock, let alone 

:cceeding depression which persists for 

varying periods of time according to the tone 

and constitution of the individual patient. 
Respiratory gymnastics are all well enough 
in their way when carried on judiciously 
under proper supervision; but their universal 
application regardless of pathological and 
physiological factors is most pernicious. Tu- 
bercular disease of the joints is invariably 
treated by enforced and complete rest; then 
why not also tubercular disease of the lungs? 
matter of fact, were lung tissue pos- 
itive fibres, pulmonary tuber- 
culosis would long since have been treated 
as is joint tuberculosis; but unfortunately for 
the former, a diseased lung can make no 
protest of pain against ill-advised gymnas- 
tics, and it is only when the pleura is invaded 
that this fact is most emphasized. And yet 
the commonest principles of physiology teach 
that a diseased lung is an organ requiring 
indulgence even in greater degree than a 
diseased joint; and although pulmonary activ- 
ity is an essential concomitant of existence, 
daily observation evidences that the function 
of the respiratory muscles over diseased 
portions of the lung is usually suspended, 
rendering that organ practically motion- 
less. " Lung gymnastics, mountain-climbing, 
douches, etc." — remarks Doctor Voiland — 
"violate that paramount rule of medicine 
which demands that the remedial efforts of 
Nature be carefully encouraged and sup- 
ported. The more these efforts are baffled 
and thwarted, the greater the danger to the 
patient." 

He further protests against the prevailing 
excessive administration of spirituous liquors, 
as tending to promote drunkenness, gastric 
catarrhs, fatty heart, fatty liver, and to lessen 
appetite — whereas appetite is the chief essen- 
tial in securing proper nourishment. At the 
same time there is equal danger in rushing to 
the opposite extreme and forbidding the glass 



of beer or light wine at the two principal 

meals. 

But the most vigorous remarks of Doctor 
Voiland are directed against the over-feeding 
of phthisical patients, ( &gt;ur present ki 

teaches that the chief hi 
the amelioration and cure of pulmonary 
phthisis is in the general improvement of 
nutrition — a principle that has been again 
and again emphatically enforced by the fail- 
ure of tuberculin. The appetite ran- 
improved, digestion invigorated, and assimi- 
lation promoted. One of the first results of 
sojourn in high altitudes is an improved ap- 
petite — the patient craves more food and 
eats heartily, — and if his medical advisor 
does not bid him check these impulses in 
time, the gastric powers may be forever 
undermined. The eructations, pressure and 
fullness after eating, coated tongue, foetid 
breach, easily provoked vomitings — especially 
when coughing, — and undue sensibility in the 
region of the stomach, all point to a catarrhal 
condition which is especially apt to be fol- 
lowed by gastric atony. As a matter of fact, 
few patients bear this excessive dietary for 
any considerable period without noticeable 
suffering; others gain in bodily weight, and 
in so doing their anxiety regarding the pul- 
monary process is lulled. 

But experience teaches that an increase in 
weight is by no means always attended with 
amelioration of pulmonary disease; many con- 
sumptives continue to lose weight despite 
an abundance of nourishment, while many 
more lose appetite and are seized with loath- 
ing at the sight of food. For a number of 
years past the majority of pulmonary patients 
arriving at Davos-Platz from medical insti- 
tutions were suffering from gastric catarrh 
and dyspepsia, which Doctor Voiland em- 
phatically declares is a sequel to over- 
feeding. 

Citing the excessive dietary thrust upon so 
many consumptives, the Doctor suggests the 
inquiry as to how long a healthy person with 
good appetite and normal digestion can with- 
stand such monstrous over-feeding? And 
what a healthy subject cannot do with im- 
punity is expected from pulmonary patients 
suffering not alone from general debility, but 
particularly from enfeebled digestive func- 
tion! Improvement in the disease process 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 






can only take place when appetite and assim- 
ilation are normal; but the existence of 
genuine appetite should never be assumed 
simply because the patient believes he can 
eat well; careful inquiry should be made as 
to whether a sensation of fullness and pres- 
sure is ever experienced in the abdominal 
area after eating, whether eructations occur, 
and whether the breath and tongue are 
normal. 

Again, since the forced feeding advocated 
by Weir Mitchell for emaciated neurasthenics 
and hysterics has been found to yield excel- 
lent results, this method has been applied to 
pulmonary disease, which certainly presents 
no factor in common with the other two 
maladies. 

Hysterical emaciation is manifestly based 
on a condition that is half psychopathic and 
accompanied with a species of food-refusal. 
The loss of appetite in consumptives, on the 
other hand, is usually conditioned only by 
fever, however slight the latter may be. 

Murchison has expressed the fear that in 
the reaction which has followed the former 
starving of typhus fever, English medicine is 
in great danger of going to the opposite ex- 
treme. Similarly, the stuffing of consump- 
tives is not scientific, but is a gross breach 
of science. There is likewise such a thing 
as the injudicious use of fresh air. While 
reclining- chairs have, in this connection, been 
of great service — since they render possible 
the combination of rest and open air with 
sunshine, — it is a mistake to permit patients 
to remain in the open air during dubious 
weather until late at night, or to send them 
forth on damp or cold days when a warm room 
is decidedly preferable. — In spite of the warm- 
est clothing and covering, rheumatic and 
pleuritic difficulties are not rare, and catarrh 
of the upper air-passages seems to occur 
quite frequently. It would seem also that 
the soil is thus prepared for subsequent in- 
fluenzas. 

In conclusion, Volland pays his compli- 
ments in very vigorous language to those 
who blunder in the use of specific medica- 
ments. For the cure of tuberculosis there is 
no specific. This must be borne in mind ere 
deciding to give the patient as much creosote 
as he can tolerate. If among ten phthisical 



patients, a single one can be found to pos 
the necessary tolerance for this agent, the 
remaining nine will sooner or later complain 
of gastric troubles, resulting from the at- 
tempt to increase the dose. Further, the 
tolerance of the one patient by no means 
proves that his phthisis has been brought to 
a standstill by the medicament; on the con- 
trary, it may be asserted that the same power 
which Nature gives the patient to resist the 
disease helps him to overcome the toxic 
action of the drug. It is astounding what 
an incredible tolerance many consumptive 
patients are capable of developing for 
the most mistaken therapeutic measures ! 
The evidence when carefully sifted goes to 
show that small doses of creosote stimulate 
the appetite at times; therefore let this re- 
sult be accepted as sufficient, since it is 
the utmost that can be expected of any 
medicament in the treatment of consump- 
tion. When the appetite is restored, discard 
the drug, returning to it again when appetite 
is suspended. The habitual administration 
of creosote unquestionably produces in nine- 
tenths of all cases profound gastric disturb- 
ance, which is of ominous import to the 
patient and can be overcome only with 
great difficulty even in the most salubrious 
climate. Finally, ever bear in mind that the 
consumptive is a very ill subject even in the 
early stages of the malady; that every pass- 
ing disturbance may be fraught with serious 
injury; that each and every extravagance in 
treatment may result disastrously. " Care 
and caution in all things" is the motto on 
which the treatment of pulmonary disease 
should be based. 



ERGOT IN MENINGITIS. 

In the New Orleans Medical and Surgical 
Journal, Doctor I. F. Young condemns the 
opium treatment of meningitis as both un- 
scientific and unsuccessful. He declares the 
indications are: To relieve the nerve strain, 
and to promote or produce quiet, refreshing 
sleep as a means to this end, which may be 
secured by bromides and chloral; to lessen 
or restrain inflammation by reducing the 
blood supply to the affected organs, which 
may be accomplished through bromides, bel-

ladonna, or ergot; to relieve hype 
and tetanic muscular contractions — bromides, 
chloral, and belladonna; to sustain the 
powers in the most careful manner: 
all remedies which will irr;: &gt;r im- 

pair the brain, or that promote stupor or 
impair digestion — quinine, alcohol, opium; 
keep patient in a darkened and well venti- 
lated room; after the acutr the attack 
begins to subside, promptly institute measures 
to repair the damage already done — iodides 
and belladonna, — a precaution often over- 
look layed. 

Doctor Young first gives calomel, followed 
bromide, and if there is high tempera- 
ture some " simple fever drops," in the mean- 
time awaiting developments. If the symp- 
toms are severe or the child large, he com- 
bines the bromide with chloral. If there is 
severe headache and it fails to yield to the 
foregoing, he administers drop doses of Kr- 
iiich he declares seldom fail to relieve the 
cephalalgia or the symptoms which so often 
occur in young children; indeed, he declares 
he has seen Ergot relieve the spasms prompt- 
ly in this disease when all the usual remedies, 
including opium, have utterly failed. He like- 
wise applies cold to the head whenever indi 
cated or agreeable; counter-irritation along 
the spine and back of the neck with croton 
oil diluted with turpentine, whenever there is 
spinal irritation; small blisters behind the 
ears whenever stupor is increasing or there is 
approaching coma. It is very important to 
begin treatment as early as possible for the 
removal of the effusion, and as soon as the 
fever declines he recommends iodide of potas- 
sium with belladonna given every four or six 
hours, believing this combination secures bet- 
ter results than when either drug is given 
alone. He explains his use of belladonna as 
follows; 

~&gt;ists the chloral and bromide very materi- 
ally in relieving pain and quieting the patient. It 
aids in lessening the blood flowing to the brain; 
prevents the depressing influence of the chloral and 
bromide on the heart; stimulates the latter; ele- 
vates the temperature, which is inclined to fall be- 
low normal; dries the surface which is now bathed 
in perspiration, and promotes elimination by acting 
on the kidneys; overcomes constipation; quiets the 
nervous system without disturbing digestion or 
appetite; renders iodide of potassium much more 



tolerable to the system while increasing its efficacy; 

and last, but not least. marked stimu- 

action on respiration, which is usualh 

rapid though usually 
slow, &lt;&gt;r even temporarily arrested at intervals. 

He further adds that since he has adopted 
the use of these remedies together wit 
tematic and liberal nourishment, the patients, 
with few :is. on convalescence not 

only feel well, but recover their full ph\ 
and mental vigor. 



APIS AtELLIFICA. 

Though this is a remedy distinctively ho- 
moeopathic, it is used by nine-tenths of the 
eclectics, and recently has received consider- 
able attention at the hands of the regular 
profession. It is claimed to be a diuretic 
most certain in its action and of great utility. 
It has repeatedly been stated that an infu- 
sion of from ten to twenty honey-bees in a 
pint of water is a most certain remedy in sup- 
pression of urine from atony, and in other 
forms of both suppression and retention; 
likewise in urethral irritation when of acute 
character and accompanied by inflammatory 
symptoms. It is also claimed as useful in 
the treatment of all dropsies, particularly of 
the post-scarlatinal variety; in irritable blad- 
der with teasing tenesmus; where the urine 
is scanty and high-colored; when micturition 
is frequent and accompanied by much sore- 
ness and burning. In eruptive diseases such 
as urticaria, measles, scarlet fever, the throat 
being constricted, of a bright red color, with 
a pulpy, swollen submucous tissue, hot and 
dry; when the uvula is swollen, long, and 
sac-like; when deglutition is difficult or the 
tonsils intensely inflamed; and in erysipelas 
with a vesicular eruption, — Apis is the remedy 
xccllencc. In oedema with irritation (a 
cellulitis), says Goss, u Apis should not be 
forgotten." In oedema of the epiglottis and 
larynx, and consequent pain and dyspnoea; 
in pericardial effusions, with distressed and 
disturbed heart action; in menorrhagia, leu- 
corrhoea, amenorrhoea, ovarian and abdomi- 
nal troubles, the remedy can, it is asserted, 
be prescribed with great confidence. The 
action of Apis appears to be constant upon 
the whole genito-urinary tract.

Cycle Therapeutics.— 

A special therapeusis, with toxins and tox- 
albume?is as a base, has been developed quite 
recently, and yet we are only following in 
the footsteps of our forefathers — we are all 
aware that the active poisonous agents in the 
different varieties of snake and some animal 
poisons are closely related to what we now 
call toxalbumens — as tuberculin, for example. 
In Doctor Benjamin Gooch's "Medical and 
Surgical Observations," published in 177 1, is 
a resume of different ancient practices that 
had animal poisons as the basis of a rational 
therapeutics. One of the most interesting of 
his observations is in connection with a de- 
tailed description of a case of severe pain, 
spasms, etc., of long continuance. Doctor 
Gooch says: "Not to appear inhuman to so 
wretched a being, after telling him I could 
do nothing I sent him a bottle of rattlesnake 
wine, to take a glass of frequently. This 
was in the West Indies drank as the highest 
cordial. Three nights after, the patient 
walked in. 'Sir,' said he, 'you cannot be so 
much amazed as I am, nor half so much 
pleased; I am come to thank you, and if not 
criminal to worship you.' " 

Doctor Gooch's account of the discovery 
of the virtues of rattlesnake wine is as fol- 
lows: "A very wealthy old gentleman in the 
West Indies had long been afflicted with lep- 
rosy to an high degree, which was deemed 
incurable by his physicians. Apparently in 
a dying state he made his will, leaving a 
large legacy to a female servant who had 
lived with him many years. This circum- 
stance being known to the servant, she and 
her paramour studied and contrived how to 
make away with him in such a manner as to 
raise the least suspicion. They put the heads 
of rattlesnakes into the wine he drank, think- 
ing it would prove an infallible poison; on 
the contrary he grew better, and the crim- 
inals, imagining the poison was not strong 
enough, added more snake-venom, whereby 
the gentleman was restored to perfect health. 
Conscience finally put this servant upon her 
knees before her master, confessing her crime. 
Forgiveness was granted, and the old gentle- 
man gave her a sum of money, ordering her 
to depart and never see him more." 

Galen, Areteus and other ancients recom- 
mended eating vipers for elephantiasis; Dam- 
pier says the natives of Tonquin treat their 
friends with arrack in which snakes and scor- 
pions have been infused, not only as a cordial, 
but as an efficacious remedy for leprosy. — 
Maritime Medical News. 



Sleepy Grass.— 

Pearsons Weekly declares that in some 
parts of New Mexico there grows a 
(Stipa viridula robust a) which produi 
somniferous effect on the animals that graze 
upon it, notably horses, cows, and sheep. It 
has occasionally happened that travelers have 
stopped to allow horses to feed in places 
where the grass grew, when the animals have 
gone to sleep on the road, and it was hard to 
arouse them. The effect passes off in an 
hour or two, and no bad results have ever 
been noticed on account of it. Cattle on 
the ranches frequently come upon patches of 
this grass, where they feed for perhaps half 
an hour, and then fall asleep for an hour or 
more, when they wake up and start feeding 
again. The programme is repeated perhaps 
a dozen times, until thirst obliges them to go 
to water. Whether, like the poppy, the grass 
contains opium, or whether its sleep-producing 
property is due to some other substance, has 
not been determined. 

A Female Army=Surgeon.— 

The Progres Medical revives the story of 
a woman doctor, in disguise, in the British 
Army, some forty years back. Scores of 
people in India remember the brilliant Sur- 
geon Macleod, who was kind, grave, and 
well up to his work, but very reserved. This 
reserve so annoyed a brother officer that he 
twitted the Doctor with living like a woman, 
and got a slap upon the face in response. A 
duel ensued, in which Surgeon Macleod 
killed his opponent, and, almost immediately 
resigning his post, left for England, where 
after several years he died; and it was only 
then discovered that Surgeon Macleod was a 
woman and a direct descendant of one of the 
oldest families of Great Britain. — Indian 
Medical Record. 

Fraudulent Iodoform Gauze.— 

In the Apotheker Zeitung Doctor Block 
describes a fraudulent iodoform gauze which 
came into his hands through ordinary com- 
mercial sources. It purported to contain 
twenty per cent, of iodoform and was of 
brilfiantly yellow color. It actually contained 
only six-tenths of one per cent., and the 
brilliant hue was imparted by auramine. To 
test either gauze or wadding for this shame- 
ful adulteration, which, in cases of serious 
surgical operations, might cost the patient 
his life, it is sufficient to thoroughly shake 
the sample in a tube of water for several 
minutes. Auramine will color the water 
yellow, whilst iodoform, of course, will not. —

The Age to Marry. — 

Men are encouraged to marry too young. 
It is a fact that between the ages of sixteen 
and twenty-five the voluptuous passions dom- 
inate; we are at our best, sexually, during 
this period of life. From twenty-five to 
forty we are at our best physically. From 
forty to sixty we are at the zenith of our 
intellectual powers. The man who marries 
before thirty, as a rule, never sees an hour 
beyond the nuptial couch. The man at fifty, 
if he be a normal man, will best impress his 
intellectual characteristics upon his progeny.

Digestible Food.— 

One of the biggest mistakes about food 
which people make is to forget that the true 
value of food to anybody is the measure of 
its digestibility. Half a pound of cheese is 
vastly more nourishing, as regards its mere 
composition, than half a pound of beef, but 
while the beef will be easily digested, and 
thus be of vast service to us, the cheese is 
put out of court altogether for ordinary folks 
by reason of its indigestibility. We should 
bear this rule in mind when we hear people 
comparing one food with another in respect 
to chemical value. — Hospital Times and Ga-

A Fast Boy.— • 

In the year 1729, says Good Health, was

boy who at the age of six years attained five 
feet six inches in height, grew a full beard, 
and was able to lift a bag of grain weighing 
200 pounds. Two years later he became 
gray. At ten his teeth fell out, his hands 
were palsied, and he tottered like a man of

Book Reviews, 



The Badminton Magazine of Sports and Pas- 
times. Edited by A. E. J. Watson. Volume I, 
No. 4. Price, 30 cents; $3.50 per year. Long- 
mans. Green &amp; Co., New York. 

The publishers of the new magazine long 
ago instituted what is known as the Badmin- 
ton Library, devoted to all legitimate sports 
and pastimes. These volumes embrace large 
game stalking, wing and small game shoot- 
ing, fishing in all its phases, golf, cricket, 
racing, etc.; and the final issue, now on the 
press, is devoted to dancing. In order to 
continue the series, Messrs. Longmans, Green 
&amp; Co. have instituted the Badminton Maga- 
zine of 150 pages monthly, which in the four 
numbers already issued promises an entirely 
new style of literature possessing interest 
and elevation of character hitherto unap- 
proached by any periodical of the class. 
Instead of being filled with wishy-washy, 
catchy tales, less than mediocre, disguised by 
cheap half-tone pictures to ''make them go," 
each article is of the best scholarly type and 
is not alone superlatively interesting, but in- 
structive as well; further, the pages are not 
soiled with records and tables which are of 
value to no one save the immediate partici- 
pants. Of the standard of literature em- 
bodied, no just estimate can be formed with- 
out a perusal of the magazine itself, yet some 
idea may be had from the table of contents 
of the issue before us: "Fox-hunting," by 
Lord Willoughby de Broke, illustrated by 
Stanley Berkeley; "The Shotgun in Norway," 
by Sir Henry Pottinger, Bart., illustrated by 
A. Thornburn and N. J. Gibb; "A Night 
Netting," by the Honorable John Scott- 
Montague, M.P., illustrated by H. G. Massey, 
A.R.P.E.; "Among the Sea Birds," by R. B. 
Lodge, illustrated from photographs; "Foot- 
ball," by C. B. Fry; "Racing in 1895," by 
Alfred E. J. Watson, illustrated by G. D. 
Giles; "Old Sporting Prints," iv, illustrated, 
by Hedley Peek; "After the Wild Deer," by 
John Edward Moss, Bart., illustrated by 
Charles Whymper; "An Autumn Holiday," 
by Susan, Countess of Malmesbury, illus- 
trated by Trevor Haddon; "The American 
Cup," by H. Horn, illustrated by R. T. 
Pritchell; "Notes" by "Rapier." It is need- 
less to say every article is in the highest de- 
gree instructive, and the illustrations are 
each and every one the epitome of all that is 
best in art. No one can peruse the first four 
papers in this issue without a material in- 
crease in knowledge of natural history. 
Watson's reviews of racing at once raise in 
the estimation of the reader the turf of Great 



Britain and the character of thoroughbred 
horses. Finally, this is emphatically a gen- 
tleman's magazine, but will be found none 
the less interesting to the fairer members of 
the household. There certainly has long been 
a need for a monthly periodical of this high 
character and class. 



The Decorator and Furnisher. Price, 20 cents; 
$2.00 a year. The Art Trades Publishing and 
Printing Co., New York. 

The October issue contains, under the 
heading of House Decoration: "An Autumn 
Luncheon," "Three Designs for Window 
Drapery," and "Art Metal Work." Under 
Furniture and Furnishings is given an illus- 
tration of "A Lady's Sleeping-Chamber," 
with outline sketches of wardrobes, and 
" Three Projects for a Bed." There are also 
two designs for mantels, executed by the 
American Terra-Cotta Co. Two interesting 
papers are on "China-Painting" and " Deco- 
rated Japanese Porcelain." Other excellent 
contributions are: "Oriental Carpets," "Per- 
sian Prayer Rug in Silk," and "Examples of 
Bokhara Sozinees (bedspreads). 

The November number gives a " Scheme 
for Decorating a House " with " designs of 
drapery for windows of reception hall, parlor, 
and library;" "A Maiden's Chamber;" also 
"Designs in Venetian Bent Iron " for flower- 
stand, photograph-holder, and clock-stand. 
"Middle-class Furniture" in the United 
States is discussed, and following are " De- 
signs (for hall clock, hall stand, settees, and 
hall chairs) in Carved Oak," "Chair after the 
Morris Ideal," "Colonial Writing-Desk," 
"Romanesque Chairs," "Writing-Desk on 
French Lines," and "Colonial Sideboard." 
There is also a particularly interesting paper 
on "The Evolution of Lamps." "An Empire 
Bedroom" is described, with illustrations. 
There is a further contribution on "Oriental 
Carpets and Rugs." Finally, "A Louis XVI. 
Bedroom" is described. There are the usual 
editorials. 



Sun and Shade. Price, 50 cents; $5.00 per year. 
New York Photogravure Co., New York. 

The November issue presents a superb 
fac simile in oil colors of Von Bodenhausen's 
"Hope." Then appears a photogravure 
taken from a photograph of Henry Ward 
Beecher, which is fairly lifelike. "The Old 
Oak," a photogravure, is from a painting by 
Dupre — the old tree stands alone before a 
darkening sky, rooted near a pool of sullen 
water, with only a few bushes contiguous, 
and is yet attractive in its declining grandeur: 
the conception is fine, the presentation per-

country mansion and 

grounds. "The Great Ten 
Simbel " is a photogravure — from a photo- 
graph taken by Mr. Edward L. Wilson — of 
gyptian temple dedicated to the goddess 

Hathor; this temple is cut entirely from the 
side of a mountain, is of red sandstone and 
ve, but apparently was never finished. 
A photogravure of "A Kan'* is an exact copy 
of one of these implements, painted by Wat- 
teau, now in the Metropolitan Museum of 
Art; it represents "Hide and Go Seek." 
known in French as Colin- Maillard. Another 
plate represents the front of "The Eye and 
Ear Infirmary," and is a photogelatin, illus- 
trative of advanced Xew York architecture. 



COSMOPOLITAN. Price. 10 cents; $1.20 a year. 
Cosmopolitan Publishing Co., (rvington-on- 
Hudson, New York. 

The fiction of the December number is by 
ason (the last story written before his 
death), "Ouida," Sarah Grand, Zangwill, and 
James Lane Allen— the latter begins a new 
Kentucky story entitled " Butterflies." Prob- 
ably no stronger array of fiction has ever 
been presented in any magazine, nor has any 
ever had a larger number of really distin- 
guished artists engaged upon the illustration 
of a single number. One is puzzled how such 
a number can be made at the price of ten 
cents, yet the magazine itself affords the 
solution. It contains 139 pages of advertis- 
ing, which, as the publishers announce, is 
from $4000 to $8000 more net cash advertis- 
ing than was ever before printed in any mag- 
azine, of any kind, or in any country; it 
breaks the world's record in the publishing 
business. Moreover, the cost of the artists 
and authors who appear in this number is 
divided amongst 400,000 copies, bringing the 
cost per copy proportionately low. The Cos- 
mopolitan thinks that the ten-cent magazine, 
bringing, as it does, the best in art and litera- 
ture to all classes, is an educational move- 
ment second in importance only to that of 
the public schools.

Littell's Living Age. Price, 15 cents; S6.00 per 
year. Littell &amp; Co., Boston. 

The announcement of a reduction in the price of 
this famous eclectic from eight to six dollars a year 
for 1S96 will prove of more than usual interest to 
lovers of choice literature. Founded in 1S44, it 
will soon enter its fifty-third year of a continuous 
and successful career seldom equaled. It is the 
oldest standard weekly, as well as the best, and 
those who desire a thorough compendium of all 
that is admirable and noteworthy in the literary 
world will be spared the trouble of wading through 
the sea of reviews and magazines published 
abroad; for they will find the essence of all com- 
pacted and concentrated here. It brings together 
between its own covers the choicest current produc- 
tions of the most brilliant writers, the best scholars, 
the most profound thinkers of the world. 

The essential features which have characterized 
the magazine and made it so desirable heretofore 
will be preserved during the coming year, and the 
same efforts continued to maintain the splendid 
record it has made in the past. 

To those whose means are limited it must meet 
with especial favor, for it offers them what could 
not otherwise be obtained except by a large outlay. 
Intelligent readers who want to save time and 
money will find it invaluable, for it furnishes the 
greatest amount of the best reading for the least 
money that one can anyw T here find. 



The Atlantic Monthly. Price, 35 cents; $4.00 a 
year. Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co., Boston. 

Conspicuous among the contents of the 
December Atlantic is another of Job 
historical studies, "The Starving Tu. 
Old Virginia;" "Witchcraft" is bv L. Dou- 
gall; "The End of the Terror," by Robert 
Wilson; and "Dorothy," by Harriet I 
Bradley. Other articles of' interest arc 
New England Woodpile," by R. E. Robin- 
son: "The Defeat of the Spanish Armada," 
by W. F. Tilton; "An Idler on Missionary 
Ridge," by Bradford Torrev; " Being a Type- 
writer," by Lucy C. Bull; "Notes from a

"The Seats of the Mighty." Book reviews 
and the usual departments complete the issue. 



Godey's Magazine. Price, 10 cents; $1.00 a year. 
The Godey Co.. Xew York. 

The December number is notable with 
Yule-tide fiction and verse, besides such 
seasonable articles as "Holiday Decora- 
tions," "Christmas, Past and Present," and 
"Christmas Day in a Japanese Go-down" — 
the latter richly illustrated by C. D. Weldon. 
Beaumont Fletcher's dramatic critique dis- 
cusses the fine points of "Hamlet" as ren- 
dered by the great actors of historic and 
contemporary fame. The musical article 
treats of H. W. Parker's compositions. "A 
New School of Portraiture on Wood," and 
"Masterpieces of French Sculpture," are two 
lavishly illustrated art articles. Liberal space 
is given to the Fashion Department.

P. Blakiston, Son &gt;S: Co., Philadelphia. 

This well known Visiting List presents 
several improvements in the new edition for 
1896 — more space has been allowed for names 
and memoranda, and columns have been added 
for the amount of weekly visits and for the 
ledger page. Lists for seventy-five and one 
hundred patients will hereafter be offered in 
two volumes only — one dated from January 
to June, the other from July to December.

deenshire from Pinafore to Gown. By Rever- 
end Duncan Anderson. M.A. 

This work is announced by J. Selwin T 
Sons, and by permission is dedicated to the Earl 
and Countess of Aberdeen. The Aberdeenshire 
people are hard-headed folks, and it is said that, 
wealthy though their city is. it is the only one in the 
United Kingdom where the Jews cannot earn a 
living. The volume is full of humor, but it is 
a true chronicle of very interesting events.

American Year Book of Medicine and Sui 

Edited by George M. Gould, A.M.. M.D. W. B. 
Saunders, Philadelphia. 

This work, which will be replete with original 
and selected illustrations skillfully reproduced from 
the studio of the publisher, will present a complete 
epitome of medicine and surgery during t! 
1895, Dorter Gould being assisted by many eminent 
American physicians and teachers. 

This is a new departure in publishing, the suc- 
cess of which we bespeak in advance. Such a 
volume will meet a deficiency in medical literature 
that can only otherwise be met by current publica- 
tions, which means an amount of periodical litera- 
ture beyond the reach of the majority of practition- 
ers. This work places before the physician in 
convenient form an epitomization of medical liter- 
ature during the preceding twelve months. The 
volume will be readv January 1st.

Therapeutic Brevities. 



Significance of Vaginal Discharges. — A leu- 
corrhcea inodorous, or of mild odor, persist- 
ing during the climacteric, accompanied by 
increasing haemorrhage, is suspicious, and 
demands investigation: 

If profuse, of peculiarly foetid odor, gru- 
mous, excoriating, appearing early or late 
during the climacteric, with profuse haemor- 
rhage, it is reasonable evidence of cancer of 
the cervix: 

When moderate in amount, ill-smelling — 
the peculiarly foetid odor of cancer of the cer- 
vix being absent, — accompanied by haemor- 
rhage, it suggests cancer of the uterine body: 

Accompanied with haemorrhage, contain- 
ing material like the washings of meat, it is 
said to indicate sarcoma: 

A watery discharge, as a rule, occurring 
during menstruation, odorless or of little 
odor, persisting, accompanied by profuse 
haemorrhage, indicates fibroids; with little or 
no haemorrhage, polypi: 

Profuse bloody discharges coming on grad- 
ually with declining menstruation, ceasing 
usually with the menstrual flow, point to 
fibroids: 

Persistent profuse discharges of blood oc- 
curring spontaneously, arising from sudden 
exercise or coition, occurring, as a rule, after 
the menopause, indicate cancer: 

The early recognition of malignant disease, 
the possible prevention, by administration of 
drugs, of that fatal exhaustion which accom- 
panies it, and the application of those methods 
which, in a measure, may be supposed to off- 
set the terrific drain on the nervous system 
— inasmuch as present experience shows that 
early removal of diseased tissue prolongs life, 
— and the importance of early diagnosis and 
treatment, can hardly be overestimated. — 
Doctor Mish, in Pacific Medical Journal. 



Normal Liquid Coca. — Since the discovery 
of the anaesthetic properties of the alkaloid 
cocaine, coca itself has received increased 
attention. Many new preparations have 
from time to time been suggested or pre- 
pared, each having as its object the presen- 
tation of the drug in such a form that its full 
effect might be obtained. That all of these 
are improvements on the old form in which 
it was and still is administered, viz., the fluid 
extract, we would by no means say. But 
one preparation, which owes its introduction 
to the stimulus above mentioned, well de- 
serves notice in this connection. The prep- 
aration we refer to is the " normal liquid coca" 



of which the makers claim that in its manu- 
facture is used only a leaf that by previous 
assay has been shown to contain a certain 
percentage of the alkaloid cocaine, and fur- 
thermore that the resulting product is brought 
to a certain standard by another determina- 
tion of its alkaloidal strength: which strength, 
and a method of verifying it, are designated 
on the label accompanying the package. 

This method of rendering exact and reli- 
able preparations which hitherto have been 
characterized by more or less variability and 
uncertainty, cannot be too much encouraged, 
and the firm that introduces them should be 
rewarded for their efforts by unmistakable 
evidence of our appreciation. — Louisville Med- 
ical News. 



The Use of Corn Silk.— This is one of my 
prize remedies in bladder troubles. It is of 
the greatest use in chronic cystitis — male and 
female, — prostatitis, catarrhal inflammations, 
and cases of cystitis and prostatitis of the 
chronic kind; especially in old men when 
these are sequels to gonorrhoea the remedy 
affords excellent satisfaction. It is of great 
value in irritable bladder of women, particu- 
larly during pregnancy. Some women have 
frequent calls to urinate, passing but a few 
drops at a time, often so very painful as to 
disturb digestion, prevent sleep, induce ner- 
vous symptoms, piles, pains in the pelvis and 
back, often marked anaemia, and quite often 
bearing-down pains — a train of symptoms 
not infrequently mistaken for disease of the 
pelvis, uterus, etc.; these I treat successfully 
with Corn Silk. Likewise cystic and renal 
maladies brought on by the use of turpentine, 
potassium iodide, and stimulant diuretics; 
also disturbance of the nervous system such 
as congestion of the lower cord or base of the 
brain, injury to back, excessive coition, and 
excitement in excess. Again, Corn Silk is 
worth trying in chronic ague; it is often 
quite successful after quinine and other anti- 
periodics have failed. — Joseph Adolphus, in 
Georgia Eclectic Medical Journal. 



Poisonous Effects of Borax. — The extensive 
use of compounds containing borax, which 
under various names are sold for preserving 
foods, lends a special interest to some obser- 
vations of Doctor Ch. Fere, of Paris, who has 
used the drug in the treatment of intractable 
cases of epilepsy, and with some success. 
For this purpose it was necessary to give 
large doses for long periods, but in the 
course of the trial he met with a considerable 
number of persons who were peculiarly sus- 
ceptible to the remedy.— Loss of appetite

' of Circumcision. — Retract the 
foreskin; insert the glans penis up to the 
corona into the open mouth of a glass test- 
tube; draw the foreskin well forward over 
the end of the tube; tie a strong, small silk 
cord very tightly around the foreskin imme- 
diately in front of the flange of the tube; 
amputate the foreskin one-eighth of an inch 
in front of the constricting cord by a circular 
i of the knife; unite the mucous and 
cutaneous edges of the stump of the prepuce 
by eight or ten fine interrupted sutures; cut 
the constricting cord; remove the tube; cover 
the cut edges well with powdered iodoform; 
encircle the anterior half of the penis with a 
roller bandage of iodoform gauze, allowing 
the meatus to project slightly for facility of 
urination without soiling or removal of the 
dressing; and keep the patient in bed, with 
the penis elevated, for from twenty-four to 
forty-eight hours. — Doctor John W. Ross, 
U. S. Xavv, in Medical Record. 



Cerebral Compression. — Victor Horsley ad- 
vances the opinion that cases of cerebral 
tumor, depressed fracture, and sudden and 
violent concussion, especially when applied 
in the occipital region, die from failure of 
respiration, and not, as is often surmised, 
from failure of heart. He says: "Of all the 
lower nerve centres which are necessary to 
the functions of so-called organic life, the 
respiratory centre is the most sensitive to 
mechanical pressure and shocks. In cases of 
apparent death from intra-cranial pressure, 
artificial respiration should be immediately 
performed, and the skull opened freely at 
once; in cases of sudden shock, artificial 
respiration should be directly instituted, and 
in every case heat should be applied to the 
head, preferably by irrigation." — Alienist and 
Neurologist.

Calomel as a Substitute for Iodoform. — An 
Italian physician, Doctor Percacini, replaces 
iodoform by Calomel for dressing all kinds 
of wounds and sores, more particularly ulcers 
of the leg, as well as eczemata resisting ordi- 
nary treatment. When applied, in the form 
of powder, to a wound which has first been 
thoroughly cleansed, this substance forms 
an antiseptic crust, strongly adherent, and 
when this becomes detached the wound is 
found to be completely cicatrized. Accord- 
ing to Doctor Percacini, the use of proto- 
chloride of mercury for dressings is contra- 
indicated only in cases of wounds and sores 
with excessive secretion, seeing that in such 
cases the pus would be retained under the 
crust formed by the powdered Calomel. — 
North American Practitioner. 



Remedies in Typhoid Fever. — Doctor Jousset, 
of the Hopital St. Jacques, Paris, records the 
following as the principal remedies in the 
treatment of typhoid: Muriatic Acid when 
there is exaggerated temperature, diarrhoea, 
and involuntary stools; Phosphoric Acid 
when there is general weakness and diarrhoea 
made up of colorless fluid; Belladonna in 
delirium, agitation, red and congested face;

toxins in the system. So far as immunization 
is concerned, experiments have been made 
only in diphtheria, measles, and scarlet fever, 
which apparently can be prevented. Failures 
may occur when the organism has become 
thoroughly saturated with the poison, and 
Nuclein, which is Nature's antitoxin, cannot 
overcome the poison. When the case is se- 
vere, one is not justified either in depending 
upon Nuclein alone or in doing without it. 
Careful hygiene, diet, and watchfulness of the 
attendants, will assist in saving the patient. —

Sodium Chloride for Relief of Pain. — I n fi ve 
adult cases of face-ache from decayed teeth, 
insufflation of Sodium chloride into the nasal 
cavity caused the pain to disappear at once. 
Numerous cases of severe headache, without 
regard to cause, and two cases of earache which 
did not call for more special treatment, yield- 
ed immediately to this remedy. A physician, 
complaining of headache and painful feeling 
of strain of the eyes, due to reading and work 
with the microscope, was promptly relieved 
by the insufflation. The dose employed was 
two to four grains of finely ground table salt, 
blown into the nose just after an expiration.

Cantharis in Hematuria. — After the acute 
stage is passed, and but little albumen and 
blood remains in the urine, the tincture of 
Cantharis will be found very useful — one to 
three minims every three hours. Likewise 
in cystitis where there is inability to retain 
urine; and in ordinary incontinence of urine. 
Drop doses three times daily often relieve 
chordee. The remedy seems to directly cause 
determination of blood to the ovaries and 
uterus, which suggests a place for it in gynae- 
cological therapeutics. — The Clinique. 



Chancroid. — Touch the ulcer every morn- 
ing for two or three consecutive days with a 
pledget of absorbent cotton dipped in the 
following solution:

Carbolic acid, 15 grains. 

Alcohol, 90 , 4 drachms.

In the meantime keep the sore covered 
with iodoform. — La Tribune Medicate. 



Varicose Veins and Ulcers. — In a paper read 
before the British Homoeopathic Society, Doc- 
tor Washington Epps recommends Fluoric 
Acid in the treatment of varicosities. He 



quotes Doctor Herring as declaring that var- 
icose veins under the action of this remedy 
have sunk to half their size. Doctor Epps 
further points out that Fluoric Acid has a 
direct action on the tissues of the veins, and 
that cases which appear to be most benefited 
are of the most chronic character. — Medical 
Century.

Aromatic spirit of ammonia, 15 minims.

Compound tincture camphor, 20 to 30 mins. 
Peppermint-water, to make 1 ounce. 

Take this at a draught every four hours.

Thyreoidin for Uterine Fibroma. — At a re- 
cent meeting of the Academie des Sciences, 
M. Jouin declared he had employed Thy- 
reoidin for patients suffering with fibrous 
tumors of the uterus: In three instances 
there was marked diminution of haemor- 
rhage, and in two others partial disappear- 
ance of the tumor. — Exchange. 



Gonorrhoea in Women.— Employ irrigation 
with a solution of Potassium permanganate 
of the strength of one to 2000, or one to 
1000, according to the case. The quantity 
used at each irrigation, which must be prac- 
ticed every day, should average about one 
quart. — Cumston. 



Nuclein. — I have repeatedly tested this 
agent in pneumonia, pleuritis, and other in- 
flammatory and infectious diseases, with most 
satisfactory results. Even in three cases of 
alcoholic and albuminuric pneumonia a man- 
ifestly favorable influence was exerted. — 
Germain See, 



Psoriasis Treated by Copaiba. — In the Ther- 
apeutic Gazette, Doctor Abbott Cantrell ad- 
vises five-minim capsules of the oil of Copaiba 
to be taken three times daily in connection 
with good nourishing diet, and free access to 
open air. — New York Medical Journal. 



Anarcotine. — This is one of the alkaloids of 
opium, and is devoid of narcotic properties. 
Doctor William Roberts calls attention to it, 
and says that it ranks next in value, as an 
antiperiodic, to quinine. The dose ranges 
from one to three grains. — Medical Record.

THE MEDICAL AGE. 



Medical Progress 



\m&gt; Modern r. ■■. reaio- 

\i Theories. — At present all our 

efforts are concentrated upon combating dis- 

y microbes, microbial products, or fluids 
derived from animals refractory to microbes. 
I am of opinion that, in cases where these 
efforts prove successful, the part played by 
bactei small, and that tempo- 

rary or permanent reaction of the organism 
is by far the most important factor. This 
brings us back to a genuinely medical theory, 
which, as has been suggested, is apt to be 
sight of in the eager pursuit of new 

The substance which, after infectious dis- 
gives to the serum of affected individ- 
uals not bactericidal but antitoxic properties, 
3 » elaborated by animal cells, the nutri- 
tion of which has been permanently modified 
by the temporary passage through them of 
vaccinating bacterial substances. This is the 
second feature of sero-therapy which so far, 
in its application to human patients, has given 
the most brilliant results. 

Behring and Kitasato in 1S90 reported ex- 
periments in sero-therapy which, in spite of 
their great analogy with my own, differ in 
the manner of action of the serum, which in 
their hands proved effective in such small 
doses that there can be no question of a 
bactericidal action. These serums do not 
kill the microbes, and do not interfere with 
their secretion, but assist the nerve-cells, and 
perhaps other cells, in resisting the action of 
the toxins, or of those among them which 
paralyze the natural defenses ot the organism 
against a microbial invasion. The antitoxic 
action is not due to a substance existing in 
the blood, nor to a peculiar chemicai condi- 
tion in the blood-plasma, but the blood or its 
plasma, or some constituent parts of this 
plasma, may acquire the property of stimulat- 
ing organic actions which naturally protect 
the organism against certain poisons. We 
already recognize two varieties of such or- 
ganic action: one consists in the destruction 
and chemical transformation of toxic sub- 
stances, the other being a stimulation at a 
distance of those portions of the nervous sys- 
tem which the toxins tend to paralyze. 

Many tissues arrest poisons; the liver and 
supra-renal capsules not only arrest but de- 
stroy them. The liver is the great destroyer 
of poisons, as the muscles are of glycogen, 
and cells generally of albumen. 

Ferments exist everywhere in the organ- 
ism; secreted by the cells, they are found in 
these cells or are discharged toward the out- 



side, frequently differing and some! 
antagonistic, according as they ex:--! in or 
outside the cell, &lt;&gt;r according as they escape 
at one or the other pole. 

Four fermentation processes at least are 
to change the albumen of food 

ellular albumen, viz.: peptonization, in 

order to pass through the intestinal epithe- 
lium; imn. ick to album- 
the other side of this epithelium; another 
peptonization in order to penetrate into the 
cells; and transformation once more into 
albumen in the interior of the cell. Each of 
these successive albumens differs from the 
preceding. All albuminoids contained in 
food are reduced to three varieties of albu- 
minoids in the blood. Serum-albumen and 
serum-globulin acquire in the cells widely 
different characters. This constitutes the 
stage of organization and assimilation, which 
is followed by the stage of destruction and 
disassimilation. Other ferments then accom- 
plish other fermentations; it has been proved 
that a peptonization of disassimilation takes 
place in certain cells and in certain patho- 
logical conditions, in which formative as well 
as destructive processes are stimulated into 
greater activity, resulting in setting free the 
cell-albumen. It is quite exceptional and 
purely pathological, however, for these pep- 
tones of disassimilation to persist as such 
outside the cells, being, as a rule, concerted 
into unstable albumens, or albumoses, des- 
tined to rapidly undergo new fermentations, 
transforming them into alkaloids, amides, or 
ammonia Lastly, these various products of 
disassimilation are taken up by other cells, 
those of the liver and kidneys, where they 
undergo a final fermentation, which reduces 
their toxicity to a minimum, renders them 
dialyzable, and converts them into urea, uric 
acid, etc., while the non-nitrogenous products 
resulting from the disintegration disappear 
by oxidation. The activity of the cell in re- 
spect of elaboration of matter consists in 
placing in contact with the substance to be 
elaborated a ferment which determines disin- 
tegration, hydration, and dehydration in the 
cell or in its neighborhood. Elaboration is 
not in itself a vital process, the only vital act 
being the formation of the ferment resulting 
from disintegration of the living molecule at 
the moment when it ceases to live. This 
holds good of diastases and other reducing 
substances, as also of diethelene, the power- 
ful oxidizing action of which has been clearly 
established. 

Such is the complete cycle of nutrition, at 
any rate considering exclusively albuminoid 
food substances, and of these only such as 
are destined to become a constituent part of

cells, leaving out of the question all but 
nitrogenous excreta. 

It appears, therefore, that the great ad- 
vance which has been realized in therapeusis 
fits naturally into the old system of medicine, 
and that the new remedies, like the old ones, 
have no other effect than to stimulate vis 
medicatrix naturce. — Professor Ch. Bou- 
chard, before the French Congress of Inter- 
nal Medicine. 



Phlegmon of the Posterior Media- 
stinum. — A young woman began to suffer 
severe pain five days after her oesophagus 
had been catheterized; the neck was swollen, 
the breath foetid, and the general condition 
alarming. An incision was made along the 
sterno-mastoid muscle, as in cesophagotomy, 
and foetid pus issued in large quantity from 
in front of the vertebral column. A bone 
which had perforated the oesophagus was 
detected and extracted by the finger. The 
entire posterior mediastinum was filled with 
pus. 

A drainage tube introduced in the ordi- 
nary way acted badly. The patient was 
therefore put in the Trendelenburg position, 
but though the evacuation proceeded satis- 
factorily the position could not be long en- 
dured, consequently resort was had to the 
siphon; improvement thereupon proceeded 
rapidly. The patient grew stout; her appe- 
tite was excellent, and soon only a small 
fistula remained at the root of the neck; she 
then insisted on leaving the hospital, and re- 
mained quite well for more than a month, 
after which fever, shivering, etc., returned. 
It was then desired to open the posterior me- 
diastinum, but the patient declined, and in 
course of time succumbed. The autopsy re- 
vealed a large purulent focus in front of the 
vertebral column, a purulent pleurisy on the 
right side, and gangrene of the lungs. These 
septic accidents would not have occurred if I 
had dared to drain the posterior mediastinum 
through and through. The existence of the 
fistula, and the persistence of the focus of 
infective mediastinitis, exposed the patient 
day by day to the risk of septic processes 
which ultimately destroyed life. — Ziembicki, 
in La France Me'dicale. 



A Permanent Dry Brain Preparation. 
— As soon as possible after removal from the 
cranial cavity, the brain is stripped of its 
membranes and placed in a saturated solu- 
tion of perchloride of mercury (seven and a 
half per cent.), care being taken to avoid dis- 
tortion of its configuration. In this solution 



it is allowed to remain for forty-eight hours, 
at the end of which time its shape will be 
fixed. 

Wash in water, and then harden in methyl- 
ated spirit for from three to five weeks. — It 
is better that the spirit be changed two or 
three times during this period. 

When quite firm, immerse in oil of turpen- 
tine, and place for three days in an incubator 
heated up to 45 C. 

Then immerse in melted Cambridge soft 
paraffin, and allow to remain in the incubator 
just above the melting-point of the paraffin 
for from four to five days. 

Extract, cool in water, clean away all the 
paraffin from the surface and sulci of the 
preparation, and finally apply a thick coat of 
spirit varnish. 

The brain can then be freely handled, and 
may further be painted with the usual mix- 
ture of oils, colors, turpentine, and gold-size. 
— Alfred W. Campbell, in Liverpool Medico- 
Chirurgical Journal. 



The Microbe Man. — This ubiquitous pre- 
tender is autocratic in government and de- 
termined in his intentions. And through his 
favorite ministers the dictum has gone forth, 
and the temple reared by the fathers, the 
pride of generations and dedicated to truth, 
must fall, its altar desecrated and its book of 
the law trampled in the earth, and the devo- 
tees of medicine must worship at the shrine 
of bacteriology. Ancient customs must be 
changed. The mouth of the coy and inno- 
cent maiden, declared by poet and lover to 
be a beautiful laboratory, with approach 
guarded by gateway of pearl and battlements 
of ruby, and walls studded with cryptic cham- 
bers in which are distilled delicate perfumes, 
sweeter far and more sought after than the 
ambrosial dew in favor with the gods, is 
transformed into a horrible cave from which 
emanates poisonous vapor, more disastrous 
in effect than a breeze wafted from the far- 
famed upas tree of mystic lore. — H. D. Hill, 
in Kansas City Medical Record. 



Cause of Murmurs in Heart and Ves- 
sels. — It is well known that current explana- 
tions of the cause of cardiac and vascular 
murmurs, in works on physical diagnosis, 
ascribe these to eddies in the blood-current, 
although Kiwisch and Weber long ago showed 
they must be due to vibrations in the walls of 
the vessels (or in the valves). This explana- 
tion is also given by Fick in his recent " Lehr- 
buch der Medicinischen Physik," and there 
have always been a few clinicians who have

Crami - as \ Sign i &gt;i 1 &gt;iabi 1 es. — Diabetic 
cramps in the lower limbs are painful but 
not of long continuance; they occur princi- 
pally in the muscles of the calf, but may also 
involve other leg- muscles or even distant 
muscles, and are most common at night. In 
conjunction with this condition there is some- 
times a painless motion or twitching of the 
leg-muscles, ob.-ervable mostly in the early 
morning after good sleep, and lasting two or 
three hours, but passing away during the 
day. These movements may number thirty 
or forty in the minute. — Sir B. \V. Richard- 
son, in AscUpiad. 



Lung Gymnastics, — In athletic exercise 
the lungs increase by the filling-out of certain 
air-cells ordinarily inactive, which only come 
into play during forced inspiration. The ex- 
pansion of the pulmonary vesicles is complete 
in proportion to the quantity of air intro- 
duced. The atmospheric air, drawn into the 
lungs by a very powerful inspiration, seeks 
out the most obscure corners and inflates the 
air-cells of certain regions which ordinarily 
have no part in the respiratory function. A 
definite increase in the volume of the lungs 
is the consequence of frequent repetition 
of this supplemental respiration. — Medical 
Gleaner. 



Peptone and Coagulation. — Injection 
of a solution of peptone into the veins of a 
dog renders the blood incoagulable for a 
longer or shorter period, and it has been 
stated by Fano that this action is not direct 
but is caused by a substance formed by the 
peptone in the organism. Experiments con- 
ducted by Clay and Pachon show that the 
liver plays a preponderating part in the 
formation of the anti-coaguiating substance

once secured it by sutures in a small incision

researches into the comparative properties of 
casein in woman's and in cow's milk. The 
casein is different in the two kinds of milk.

GRANULAR CONJUNCTIVITIS.* 

BY ALBERT E. BULSON, JR., B.S., M.D. 

So much has been written about granular 
conjunctivitis — or trachoma — that it would 
seem as if every practitioner of medicine 
ought to be thoroughly acquainted with its 
aetiology, symptomatology, diagnosis, and 
treatment; and yet the disastrous impair- 
ment of vision frequently seen as a direct 
sequence, leads to the belief that many either 
do not recognize the importance of early and 
proper treatment, or at least fail to apply the 
latter intelligently. 

The typical acute granular conjunctivitis 
is a malady somewhat rare in this country, 
but usually arises under the same conditions 
as the chronic form — i. e., bad hygienic sur- 
roundings, as in institutions where the in- 
mates are crowded; it is often confounded 
with the violent exacerbations to which the 
chronic form is liable. Chronic granular con- 
junctivitis may be a sequel to the acute form, 
though it usually occurs as a primary dis- 
order without any antecedent inflammation 
and appears so insidiously that its real nature 
is for a time unrecognized. That it origi- 
nates by infection and produces an infectious, 
purulent secretion, appears to be well estab- 
lished. As infection occurs only by trans- 
ference of secretion from one to another by 
means of fingers, towels, handkerchiefs, 
sponges, etc., it is readily understood why it 
appears most frequently among those of 
slovenly personal habits. Crowded dwell- 
ings, tenements, boarding-houses, schools, 
and penal institutions, etc., are favorable 
places for its development; and here when 
once established it spreads extensively. In

cal Society. 



the smaller cities and towns it is chiefly found 
among the poorer classes, those who pay little 
attention to cleanliness. 

Many claim some peculiar dyscrasia pre- 
disposes to this malady, since certain people 
— such as the Jews, Irish, Italians, Orientals, 
as well as the Indians— are especially liable 
thereto: yet it would seem as if a satisfactory 
explanation existed in the fact that these 
classes, in their lower grades, are noted for 
lack of personal cleanliness. Again, the dis- 
ease is more apt to attack those living in 
damp places, for high altitudes confer com- 
parative immunity. 

Many forms of granular conjunctivitis are 
recognized, each distinguished by some pe- 
culiar clinical feature, but for practical pur- 
poses two divisions only are necessary, viz., 
the papillary and the follicular. 

Papillary trachoma often succeeds acute 
conjunctivitis, and consists in the develop- 
ment of transparent granules about the size 
of rapeseed or less, which develop exclu- 
sively in the tarsal conjunctiva and are 
unattended by any great amount of inflam- 
mation or discharge; this stage may last for 
months and be subject to innumerable varia- 
tions, and eventually terminate in the second 
form, when the follicles become larger and 
more numerous and the mucous membrane 
thickened and highly congested; there is also 
much irritation, purulent or muco-purulent 
secretions, photophobia, pain; and, finally, 
if unchecked, corneal complications occur 
that constitute the most deplorable of all 
the features of this condition. 

The sequelae of follicular conjunctivitis are 
most familiar, especially to ophthalmologists, 
who are more often, perhaps, consulted there- 
for than for the primary malady. If follicu- 
lar degeneration has not progressed to cica- 
trization, the evil results will be been chiefly 
in the vascular and ulcerated condition of the 
cornea; but if such changes become estab-

I'mler the most favorable circno - 

well established granular conjunctivitis is a 
llOUS disease, and one that greatly endan- 
e frequent, and the 
- &gt;rder is liable to assume an intense Inflam- 
matory character that in a few days may 
result in the destruction of the already dis- 
ised ami weakened cornea. The contagious 
character of the affection renders it especially 
dangerous in public institutions or where a 
large number are gathered together, though, 
if taken in time, vision can usually be pre- 
served; unfortunately the majority have not 
the patience to persist in the thorough treat- 
ment that is essential to safety and succor. 

Acute granular conjunctivitis, attended by 
chemosis, pain, lachrymation, and congestion, 
must be managed upon the same principles 
which govern the treatment of acute con- 
junctivitis, soothing lotions constituting the 
principal treatment. 

The papillary form of chronic granular 
conjunctivitis, so common as a sequel of 
simple acute conjunctivitis, demands mod- 
eration in treatment. If the granulations 
are accompanied by slight congestion of the 
conjunctival membrane, and discharge, solu- 
tions of nitrate of silver, five to ten grains to 
the ounce, will produce satisfactory results. 
If the granulations are unaccompanied by 
marked congestion or discharge, alum or 
sulphate-of-copper crystal will prove most 
beneficial, applied carefully as often as every 
other day. 

Typical follicular or trachomatous chronic 
granular conjunctivitis, with conspicuous lym- 
phoid infiltration, is treated either by local 
application of caustics and astringents, or by 
operative procedures. 

Of local applications, solutions of bichlo- 
ride of mercury, of nitrate of silver, or of 
cupric sulphate in crystal form, are deserving 
of favor. Bichloride solutions (i to 300 or 
500) and sulphate-of-copper crystals are most 
beneficial in cases having little or no puru- 
lent discharge, while solution of silver nitrate 
(five to twenty grains to the ounce) are par- 
ticularly adapted to those in which discharge 
is one of the prominent symptoms. Appli-

By far the most - treatment is that 

which has for its object th&lt; uion of 

the granulations or follicles by opera' 
procedures. When the granules are distil 
and separate, they may be picked out by 
means of a fine needle, or destroyed with a 
fine-pointed galvano-cautery needle, the parts 
having previously been anaesthetized b] 
five-per-cent. solution of cocaine. If the 
granulations are so prominent and numerous 
as to make a redundant mass, which appears 
in corrugations and irregular elevations when 
the lid is everted, the patient will be most 
expeditiously and effectively relieved by 
squeezing the lymphoid infiltration out with 
suitable instruments. The roller forceps ad- 
vocated by Rnapp are admirably adapted 
for the purpose, and at one sitting all the 
morbid material can be thereby removed. 
Immediately after the operation, cold com- 
presses, saturated in bichloride solution (1 to 
6000), should be applied to subdue inflamma- 
tory reaction, and after the acute inflamma- 
tion has subsided the subsequent treatment 
will consist in the application of mild astrin- 
gents, such as alum crayon or tannin solu- 
tion. 

Much has been written regarding the disas- 
trous results following operative procedures 
with roller forceps, but I feel satisfied that 
the procedure is attended by no ill-effects if 
properly and judiciously employed. Great 
care must of course be exercised in the selec- 
tion of cases for operative procedures, as 
also in the treatment to subdue inflammatory 
reaction directly dependent upon the trauma. 
The operation has been attended by satis- 
factory results in every instance in which I 
have employed it, always cutting short a 
treatment that, by the older methods, would 
have occupied many months and perhaps 
years of time; and unquestionably many of 
the complications that attend the disc 
have been forestalled by the early eradica- 
tion of the irritative element upon which such 
complications depend. 

In no instance have I employed the roller 
forceps for the removal of discrete granula- 
tions, the operative treatment in such cases

being confined to the fine-pointed electro- 
cautery needle, which I consider of utmost 
efficiency. 

The roller forceps are also not adapted to 
that form of trachoma in which there is a 
uniform thickening of the parts without 
marked lymphoid infiltration. In this class 
of cases the treatment should consist of appli- 
cations of solutions of silver nitrate, or sul- 
phate-of-copper crystal, the preference usu- 
ally depending upon the presence or absence 
of secretion. 

An infusion of jequirity (one bean to six 
or eight drachms of water, infused for 
twenty-four hours) has of late been much 
recommended in the treatment of all forms 
of granulated lids; but, having had a slight 
experience with this remedy, as well as having 
observed its action in cases occurring in the 
practice of others, I am not prepared to look 
upon it with favor. An intense and painful 
inflammation, diphtheritic in appearance, de- 
velops as a result of an application of this 
infusion, which persists for from ten days to 
two weeks, and oftentimes threatens total 
destruction of the eye. The adoption of this 
procedure is warranted only in inveterate 
cases where all other remedies have failed, or 
where vision is seriously impaired by well 
marked pannus. In the latter class of cases 
the treatment will sometimes produce a nota- 
ble clearing of the cornea and favorable 
change in the condition of the cicatrices and 
granulations of the lid. 

A point not to be forgotten is, that the 
disease is an infectious one, and that there- 
fore attention to proper hygienic regulations 
must not be omitted. — Not only local but 
general cleanliness is of utmost importance. 
As a local antiseptic and cleansing solution 
for the eye, nothing excels the bichloride 
solution (i to 6000 or 8000), and the patient 
should be instructed to use this thoroughly 
and often. As a general application, nothing 
is better than the free use of soap and water, 
which in many instances must be prescribed 
by the physician, the appearance of the 
patient indicating but a slight acquaintance 
with such a valuable remedy. 

Granular conjunctivitis or trachoma must 
at all times be considered a grave disorder, 
and the success attained in its treatment will 
to a large extent depend not only upon 



thoroughness, but upon the intelligent selec- 
tion of procedures or remedies. Surgical 
measures, as pointed out, are not applicable 
to all types and forms, but they are applicable 
to the larger portion of those cases which 
ordinarily threaten to result disastrously to 
the vision, and which if treated by the older 
method would not only tax the patience of 
both physician and patient, but possibly re- 
sult in ill success, even though receiving the 
most careful and thorough management.

NASA FEVER OF INDIA. 

BY N. C. MITRA, M.A., M.B. 

Ndsd is the Sanskrit word for nose. Ndsd 
fever is a malady somewhat common to India, 
and especially to Bengal, that is due to a 
peculiar affection of the nasal mucous mem- 
brane. Strange to say, it appears to have 
attracted no attention in England or Amer- 
ica, as it has never been described in any 
text-book of these countries — probably be- 
cause it does not exist in either. 

Opinions are divided as to the real pathol- 
ogy of the affection. So far as has been 
worked out, it seems to be a " form of brain 
fever," with local exhibition in the way of 
congestion or turgescence of the blood- 
vessels of the Schneiderian membrane. The 
swelling, however, is not of an inflammatory 
nature, as some suppose; is not in the least 
painful, though it fluctuates on pressure, 
and is red in appearance. The patient is, 
as a rule, quite unaware of the presence 
of swelling, and coincidently therewith, al- 
most, appears the febrile disturbance, which 
assumes, usually, a remittent type, though 
sometimes it is intermittent. The tempera- 
ture in the evening rarely rises above 102 , 
and may be normal or only a trifle above by 
morning. The accessory symptoms are very 
troublesome, and it is for the relief of these 
that the sufferer usually resorts to a medical 
man. There is excessive frontal headache, 
and a sensation of heaviness all over the 
head; dull pain all along the spinal column, 
shoulders, and the back of the neck: but the 
strangest fact is the absence of any uneasy 
sensation at the site of the swelling, and this 
strikes one as all the more peculiar because 






THE MEDICAL AGE. 



of the naturally sensitive character of nasal 
DIOCOUS membrane. 

The raise of this malady remains quite 
unexplained; it has not yet been definitely 

worked out whether the fever and the .swell 
ppear simultaneously, whether the swell- 
ing pi the fever, as is the rule with all 
inflammatory pyrexias, or whether the fever 
appears first, as is the case in eruptive mala- 
nor has it been determined when the 
^welling makes its appearance, since no re- 
liable symptoms are present in the beginning. 
'The attack is generally ushered in, however, 
by a preliminary period of malaise. The 
bowels are costive, the tongue coated, and 
appetite dull. After a few days the fever 
subsides, the temperature rising only to 99" 
in the evening, yet the troublesome acces- 
sories remain and are as annoying as ever. 
There is no definite duration to the fever, 
though generally a high temperature persists 
for from three to five days. The swelling 
never suppurates. 

As the patient does not complain of any 
uneasy sensation at the site of the swelling, 
it is very difficult sometimes for the physician 
to arrive at an accurate diagnosis, though the 
lingering pains in the head and back without 
the complication of any organic disease are 
usually sufficient landmarks. Old sufferers, 
with the first premonition or warning, resort 
to their medical advisor to have their noses 
examined, and practitioners who are not fa- 
miliar with nasi often mistake the character 
of the nasal symptoms. 

But once the case is definitely diagnosed 
by one familiar with the malady, there is a 
practical end to the trouble. The prognosis 
is always favorable, though sometimes the 
temperature rises, fever becomes high, and 
delirium supervenes, followed possibly by 
coma and, very rarely, death. 

Internal treatment is of little or no avail, — 
antiperiodics have not the slightest effect on 
the course of the fever. For the relief of 
pain, bromide, chloral, cannabis Indica and 
caffeine answer best; tartar emetic has been 
lauded by many as quickly alleviating the 
troubles, and a mild purgative at the begin- 
ning is useful. 

Local treatment consists in puncturing the 
mucous membrane at the site of the swelling, 
thereby securing free haemorrhage, which in- 



variably is of blackish-red hue, and tr 
d&lt;»wn like some thick substance. Now the 
patient experiences speedy relief; pain rapidly 
diminishes, the fever goes oil" in a day or two, 
and the sufferer is free from any complaint 
whatever. I make the puncture with a fine 
trocar; some use the lancet; but whatever 
instrument is employed, the puncture should 
be freelv made, ensuring abundant bleeding; 
otherwise the opening closes up, requiring to 
to be reopened a day or two later. Unfortu- 
nately, most of the sufferers object to the 
puncture, fearing they will ever after be 
obliged to subject themselves to like treat- 
ment whenever troubled with nasi; they pre- 
fer the application of silver nitrate — the solid 
lunar caustic, — or the milky juice of the 
plant known as kemda or mudar {Calotropis 
giganiea). The swelling, if left to itself, may 
be absorbed, but a long time is required for 
such a process to be completed, and in the 
meantime the patient has to put up with all 
the attendant troubles, and it is to obviate 
these that the juice of the mudar is applied. 
Some recommend an application of a two-per- 
cent, solution of cocaine, declaring the swell- 
ing disappears on repeated application; and 
while such may prove effective in an indi- 
vidual case, as a rule it is of little or no 
benefit; cold affusion, and friction, give bet- 
ter results in most instances. 

As one attack predisposes to another, 
native physicians recommend thorough rub- 
bing of the affected mucous membrane with 
mustard oil to guard against future attacks: 
and I have one patient who appears every 
six months to have his Schneiderian mem- 
brane punctured. Nisi may recur every 
month, bi-monthly, every six months, or 
yearly, and some are so sensitive to its influ- 
ence as to require constant attention in order 
to ward off attacks.

States was not accomplished until the spring 
of 1864, when Congress passed the following 
Act, which was approved by the President on 
March 1st, 1864, and promulgated by the Sec- 
retary of War in General Orders No. 106, 
War Department, A.-G.O., Washington, D.C., 
March 16th, 1864: 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep- 
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled: That the medical director or 
chief medical officer of each army corps shall, 
under the control of the medical director of the 
army to which such army corps belongs, have the 
direction and supervision of all ambulances, medi- 
cine and other wagons, horses, mules, harness, and 
other fixtures appertaining thereto, and of all offi- 
cers and men who may be detailed or employed to 
assist him in the management thereof, in the army 
in which he may be serving.* 

Sec. 2. And be it further enacted: That the 
commanding officer of each army corps shall detail 
officers and enlisted men for service in the ambu- 
lance corps of such army corps, upon the following 
basis, viz.: One captain, who shall be commandant 
of said ambulance corps; one first lieutenant for 
each division in such army corps; one second lieu- 
tenant for each brigade in such army corps; one 
sergeant for each regiment in such army corps; 
three privates for each ambulance, and one private 
for each wagon; and the officers and non-commis- 
sioned officers of the ambulance corps shall be 
mounted: Provided, That the officers, non-com- 
missioned officers, and privates so detailed for each 
army corps shall be examined by a board of medi- 
cal officers of such army corps as to their fitness for 
such duty; and that such as are found to be not 
qualified shall be rejected, and others detailed in 
their stead. 

Sec. j. And be it further enacted: That there 
shall be allowed and furnished to each army corps 
two-horse ambulances upon the following basis, to 
wit: Three to each regiment of infantry of five hun- 
dred men or more; two to each regiment of more 
than two hundred and less than five hundred men; 
and one to each regiment of infantry of less than 
two hundred men; two to each regiment of cavalry 
of five hundred men or more; and one to each regi- 
ment of cavalry of less than five hundred men; one 
to each battery of artillery — to which battery of 
artillery it shall be permanently attached; to the 
headquarters of each army corps two such ambu- 
lances; and to each division train of ambulances 
two army wagons; and ambulances shall be al- 
lowed and furnished to division brigades and com- 
mands not attached to any army corps upon the 
same basis, and each ambulance shall be provided 
with such number of stretchers and other appli- 
ances as shall be prescribed by the Surgeon-General. 
Provided, That the ambulances and wagons herein 
mentioned shall be furnished, as far as practicable, 
from the ambulances and wagons now in the ser- 
vice. 

Sec 4. And be it further enacted: That horse- 



*The number of men detailed by this law seems 
barely sufficient to perform the work of ambulance 
and dressing station orderlies. The only inference 
is that during the war of 1861-65 the bearer work 
was done by fatigue details from the line of the 
Army. 



and mule-litters may be adopted or authorized by 
the Secretary of War, in lieu of ambulances, when 
judged necessary, under such rules and regulations 
as may be prescribed by the medical director of 
each army corps. 

Sec. 5. And be it further enacted: That the 
captain shall be the commander of all the ambu- 
lances, medicine and other wagons in the corps, 
under the immediate direction of the medical direc- 
tor or chief medical officer of the army corps to 
which the ambulance corps belongs. He shall pay 
special attention to the condition of the ambu- 
lances, wagons, horses, mules, harness and other 
fixtures appertaining thereto, and see that they 
are at all times in readiness for service; that the 
officers and men of the ambulance corps are 
properly instructed in their duties, and that their 
duties are performed, and that the regulations 
which may be prescribed by the Secretary of War, 
or the Surgeon-General, for the government of 
the ambulance corps, are strictly observed by 
those under his command. It shall be his duty 
to institute a drill in his corps, instructing his men 
in the most easy and expeditious manner of moving 
the sick and wounded, and to require in all cases 
that the sick and wounded shall be treated with 
gentleness and care, and that the ambulances and 
wagons are at all times provided with attendants, 
drivers, horses, mules, and whatever may be neces- 
sary for their efficiency; and it shall be his duty 
also to see that the ambulances are not used for 
any other purpose than that for which they are 
designed and ordered. It shall be the duty of the 
medical director or chief medical officer of the 
army corps, previous to a march, and previous to 
and in time of action, or whenever it may be neces- 
sary to use the ambulances, to issue the proper 
orders to the captain for the distribution and man- 
agement of the same, for collecting the sick and 
wounded and conveying them to their destination. 
And it shall be the duty of the captain faithfully 
and diligently to execute such orders. And the 
officers of the ambulance corps, including the med- 
ical director, shall make such reports, from time to 
time, as may be required by the Secretary of War, 
the Surgeon-General, the medical director of the 
army or the commanding officer of the army corps 
in which they may be serving; and all reports to 
higher authority than the commanding officer of 
the army corps shall be transmitted through the 
medical director of the army to which such army 
corps belongs. 

Sec. 6. And be it further enacted: That the first 
lieutenant assigned to the ambulance corps for a 
division shall have complete control, under the 
captain of his corps and the medical director of the 
army corps, of all the ambulances, medicine and 
other wagons, horses, mules, and men in that por- 
tion of the ambulance corps. He shall be the act- 
ting assistant-quartermaster for that portion of the 
ambulance corps, and will receipt for and be re- 
sponsible for all the property belonging to it, and 
be held responsible for any deficiency in anything 
appertaining thereto. He shall have a traveling 
cavalry forge, a blacksmith, and a saddler, who 
shall be under his orders, to enable him to keep 
his train in order. He shall have authority to 
draw supplies from the depot quartermaster, upon 
requisition approved by the captain of his corps, 
the medical director, and the commander of the 
army corps to which he is attached. It shall be 
his duty to exercise a constant supervision over his 
train in every particular, and keep it at all times 
ready for service. 

Sec. y. And be it further enacted: That the sec-

ond lieutenant shall have command of the portion 
of the ambulai be 

under the imn I lieutenant, 

and he shall e .ireful SUpervU r the 

itioti of 
the ambulance corps for his brigade; and it shall 
be the duty of the onduct drills and 

inspections of the ambulances, under hi&lt; 01 
thei- riments. 

And be it further enacted That the ain- 

I in the armies ^i the United States shall 

be u&lt;ed only for th nation of the sick and 

tided, and, in nly, for medical 

lies, and all persons shall be prohibited from 

usin^ them, or requiring them to be used, for any 

purpose. It shall be the duty of the off 

of*the ambulance corps to report to the commander 
of the army corps any violation of the provisions 
this section, or any attempt to violate the same. 
Ami any officer who shall use an ambulance, or re- 
quire it to be used, for any other purpose than as 
provided in this section, shall, for the first offi •:. 
be publicly reprimanded by the commander of the 
army corps in which he may be serving, and for 
the second offense shall be dismissed from the 
Ice, 

\nd be it further enacted: That no per- 
pt the proper medical officers, or the offi- 
cers non-commissioned officers, and privates of the 
ambulance corps, or such persons as may be spe- 
cially assigned, by competent military authority, to 
duty with the ambulance corps for the occasion, 
shall be permitted to take or accompany any sick 
or wounded men to the rear, either on the march 
or upon the field of battle. 

TO. And be it further enacted: That the 
officers, non-commissioned officers, and privates of 
the ambulance corps shall be designated by such 
uniform or in such manner as the Secretary of War 
shall deem proper: Provided, That officers and 
men may be relieved from service in said corps, 
and others detailed to the same, subject to the ex- 
amination provided in the second section of this 
Act, in the discretion of the commanders of the 
armies in which they may be serving. 

Sec. 1 1. And be it further enacted: That it shall 
be the duty of the commander of the army corps 
to transmit to the Adjutant General the names and 
rank of all officers and enlisted men detailed for 
service in the ambulance corps of such army corps, 
stating the organizations from which they may 
have been so detailed; and, if such officers and 
men belong to volunteer organizations, the Adju- 
tant-General shall thereupon notify the governors 
of the several States in which such organizations 
were raised of their detail for such service; and it 
shall be the duty of the commander of the army- 
corps to report to the Adjutant-General from time 
to time the conduct and behavior of the officers 
and enlisted men of the ambulance corps, and the 
Adjutant-General shall forward copies of such re- 
ports, so far as they relate to officers and enlisted 
men of volunteer organizations, to the governors of 
the States in which such organizations were raised. 
Sec. 12. And be it further enacted: That noth- 
ing in this Act shall be construed to diminish or 
impair the rightful authority of commanders of 
armies, army corj irate detachments, over 

the medical and other officers and the non-commis- 
sioned officers and privates of their respective com- 
mands. 

Approved March nth, 1S64. 

By the passage of this Act the authority of 

the Medical Department over the ambulance 



corps was fully established. How effectually, 
ami at the same time how considerately, the 

medical officers availed thea of the 

power thus conferred upon them, is Striking 
shown in the systematic manner with which 
the immense number of wounded after the 
battles of the Wilderness, Spottsylvania Court 
House, Cold Harbor, Petersburg, and of the 
campaigns in Georgia ami the Carolina*, were 

d for on the battle-field, were removed 
field and base hospitals, and were finally dis- 
tributed in general hospitals throughout all 
parts of the United States. Notwithstanding 
the opinion of General H. W. Halleck, no 
panics or stampedes were reported as having 
been caused by the presence of the non- 
combatants of the ambulance corps. 

Major Heizmann, Medical Department 
I '. S. A., in his admirable paper on "Mili- 
tary Sanitation in the Sixteenth, Seventeenth 
and Eighteenth Centuries," writes: 

The persistence of regimental hospitals in 
England and America to the beginning of 
the present century is a relic of the company 
methods of the sixteenth century. 

England learned in the Crimean War the 
utter inadequacy of such sanitary organiza- 
tions; but it was not until the War of Seces- 
sion, in the face of a threatened break-down, 
and literally under fire, that we abandoned a 
method which for a hundred years had in 
other armies been relegated to history. Ma- 
jor Winne, Medical Department U. S. A., 
writes:* 

Our sick and wounded in Mexico had no 
special provision made for them. The regu- 
lation temporary details for field service were 
taken from the line. . . . The outbreak 
of the Civil War found us absolutely without 
organization of any kind for taking prompt 
care of large numbers of wounded. None 
but those who served in the field then can 
realize the chaos which existed. 

What was finally accomplished, and at 
what cost, is a part of the history of that 
terrific struggle. Our author concludes: 

The greater number of medical officers 
who distinguished themselves in our war, by 
carrying the operations of their department 
to a height of usefulness and perfection 
never before known, and which won the un-

qualified admiration of Europe, have passed 
away. It is needless to recapitulate their 
names. Their monument is perpetuated in 
the medical and surgical mstory of the war. 
" Monumentum aere perennius," and as, in 
the noble words of Lord Bacon, "they at- 
tained worthy ends and expectations," their 
memories are cherished in the hearts of their 
surviving comrades. 

With the close of the war, so rich in 
dearly bought experience, the Medical De- 
partment, apparently content to embalm 
that experience between the covers of its 
great history, returned to the methods of 
anti-bellum days, and the Army again be- 
came the advance guard of civilization upon 
our western frontier. 

A generation of medical officers has grown 
up who know not war, and whose experience, 
gained at best in Indian outbreaks and 
expeditions, but ill fits them to meet the 
exigencies of that for which alone they exist. 
The art of war in its destructive phases is for 
the line officer. The art of military sanita- 
tion — the most special and yet most compre- 
hensive of all the specialties of our pro- 
fession—is for the medical officer. 

The history of the Medical Department 
since 1865 may be outlined as follows: 

On July 28th, 1866, the following Act of 
Congress became law: 

The Medical Department of the Army shall 
consist of one surgeon-general, with the rank of 
brigadier-general: one assistant surgeon-general, 
with the rank of colonel of cavalry; one chief 
medical purveyor, and four assistant medical pur- 
veyors, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel of 
cavalry; sixty surgeons, with the rank of major of 
calvary; one hundred and fifty assistant-surgeons, 
with the rank of lieutenant of cavalry for the first 
three years of service, and the rank of captain of 
cavalry after three years' service. 

On March 3d, 1869, all promotion or ap- 
pointment in the Medical Department (and 
other staff corps) was suspended, and there- 
after till 1874 the Department simply marked 
time. Never since its reorganization had all 
its offices been filled; and in 1874, when ex- 
aminations for appointment were reinstituted, 
there were nearly sixty vacancies. 

By Act of Congress approved June 23d, 
1874, the Medical Department of the Army 
thereafter consisted of one surgeon-general 
with the rank, pay and emoluments of a 
brigadier -general; one assistant surgeon- 
general and one chief medical purveyor. 



each with the rank, pay and emoluments of 
a colonel: and two assistant medical pur- 
veyors, with the rank, pay and emoluments 
of lieutenant-colonels; fifty surgeons, with 
the rank, pay and emoluments of majors; 
one hundred and fifty assistant-surgeons, 
with the rank, pay and emoluments of lieu- 
tenants of cavalry for the first five years' 
service, and with the rank, pay and emolu- 
ments of captains of cavalry after five years' 
service. And all original vacancies in the 
grade of assistant-surgeon were to be filled 
by selection by competitive examination; 
and the Secretary of War was authorized to 
appoint, from the enlisted men of the Army, 
or cause to be enlisted, as many hospital 
stewards as the service might require, to be 
permanently attached to the Medical Depart- 
ment, under such regulations as he might 
prescribe. 

The permanent attachment of hospital 
stewards t6 the Medical Department, reiter- 
ated in this law, was the germ of an organ- 
ization which thereafter sprang into existence, 
and which is destined to radically change 
the methods that have for so many years ob- 
tained in our service — methods which were 
only temporarily changed to meet the exi- 
gences of the most stupendous war the world 
has seen. 

The Act of June 26th, 1S76, declared that 
the number of assistant-surgeons allowed by 
law should be reduced to one hundred and 
twenty-five: in addition to the grades then 
allowed by law, there should be four sur- 
geons with the rank, pay and emoluments of 
colonels, and eight surgeons with the rank, 
pay and emoluments of lieutenant-colonels, 
to be promoted by seniority from the medi- 
cal officers of the Army. 

No further legislation affecting the Medi- 
cal Department became law until March 1st, 
1887, when the following Act was passed: 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Repre- 
sentatives of the United States of America in Con- 
gress assembled: That the hospital corps of the 
United States Army shall cor.- -pital stew- 

ards, acting hospital stewards, and privates: and 
all necessary hospital services in garrison, camp, 
or field (including ambulance service; shall be per- 
formed by the members thereof, who shall be reg- 
ularly enlisted in the military service; said corps 
shall' be permanently attached to the Medical De- 
partment, and shall not be included in the effective 
strength of the Army, nor counted as part of the 
enlisted force provided by law.

shall be thirteen [since increased to eighteen] dol- 
lars per month, with the increase on account of 
length of service as is now or may hereafter be 
allowed by law to other enlisted men; they shall be 
entitled to the same allowances as a corporal of the 
arm of service with which they are on duty. 

That privates of the hospital corps may be de- 
tailed as acting hospital stewards by the Secretary 
of War, upon the recommendation of the Surgeon- 
General, whenever the necessities of the service 
require it; and when so detached their pay shall 
be twenty-five dollars per month, with increase as 
above stated. Acting hospital stewards, when edu- 
cated in the duties of the position, may be eligi- 
ble for examination for appointment as hospital 
steward, as above provided. 

Loosely drawn and elastic as is this law, no 
Act of Congress since that of 1847 — which 
for the first time recognized the military 
status of the medical officer — is more impor- 
tant to the present efficiency and future use- 
fulness of the Medical Department. All the 
regulations governing this organization are 
of necessity based upon this law, and very 
well meet the current requirements of the 
various detachments scattered throughout 
the country; but such active-service experi- 
ence as has been gained therewith has shown 
that a more closely knit military organization 
is necessary. This is directly in line with 
the experience of military medical officers in 
other armies. And there can be no question 
that a very much more detailed organization 



than now exists in the hospital corps will be 
when we fmd oui - soon 

surely will, in th% midst &lt;&gt;f a Wat Let us

The Company of Instruction* organized 
by the compiler, at Fort Riley, Kansas, under 
authority of the Secretary of War, as a train- 
ing school for men of the hospital corps, still 
exists and is doing good work; but its organ- 
ization is of necessity only of the most tem- 
porary and tentative character. That it has 
proved its right to exist is shown by the tes- 
timony of all who are familiar with its excel- 
lent results. 

The following Act of Congress was ap- 
proved July 27th, 1892; 

That, from and after the passage of this Act, the 
grade of certain medical officers of the Army below 
that of surgeon-general shall be as follows: Those 
holding the rank of colonel, assistant surgeon- 
generals; those holding the rank of licut 
colonel, deputy surgeon-generals. 



*This company was organized in the autumn of 
1891. and was without precedent in our service. A 
second company was organized at Fort D. A. Rus- 
sell, Wyo., in 1892, which was subsequently trans- 
ferred to Washington Barracks, D. C.

cavalry, assistant- surgeons shall be examined 
under the provisions of an Act approved October 
ist, 1892. . . . 

That medical officers of the Army may be as- 
signed by the Secretary of War to such duties as 
the interests of the service may demand. 

That all Acts or parts of Acts inconsistent with 
the provisions of this Act are hereby repealed. 

The third section of this Act abrogates 
Section 1169 of the Revised Statutes, viz.: 
"Officers of the Medical Department of the 
Army shall not be entitled, in virtue of their 
rank, to command in the line of the Army or 
in other staff corps;" and places the Medical 
Department in the same category with that 
of the staff corps, as set forth in paragraph 
16, Army Regulations, 1889. 

From the foregoing it will be observed 
that there exists to-day in the Medical De- 
partment of the United States Army no 
detailed scheme of organization for active 
service.* The war scheme promulgated by 
the law of 1864, which ceased to actively 
exist with the surrender of the Confederate 
forces, was abrogated by the peace scheme 
of 1887, which provides that " all necessary- 
hospital services in garrison, camp or field 
(including ambulance service), shall be per- 
formed by the members of the Hospital 
Corps." Contrasted with the almost perfect 
sanitary organization of other armies, our 
own unpreparedness in this direction points 
a moral we can ill afford to ignore. 

The argument usually advanced f in oppo- 
sition to a reorganization is the fact that 
existing arrangements as respects subdivision 
of staff duties accords with the staff organiza- 
tion of the war period. 

This objection to change may be disposed 
of by the statement that the efficient armies 
of the world have little resemblance, as re- 
spects organization, to those maintained 
thirty years ago. Arms, equipments, systems 
of evolution, and method of supply have all 



* The paragraphs (1590 to 1602) of Army Regu- 
lations, 1889, under the caption "Hospital and 
Ambulance Service in War," give a general out- 
line of sanitary organization; this outline embraces 
simply the principles of battle-field assistance, and 
utterly fails to enter into the details of organization 
so essential to successful work. Hence it may be 
justly said that in the Medical Department of the 
United States Army there exists to-day no detailed 
scheme of organization for active service.

been radically changed so as to make them 
conform to the new conditions of armament 
and the requirements of modern times. The 
general tendency is the concentration of chief 
authority, and an organization in each branch 
so close, thorough, and complete that coop- 
eration can be had from each subordinate.

CORPULENCE AND ARTERIOSCLEROSIS. 

BY DOCTOR E. HEIXRICH K1SCH. 

One of the most frequent and serious col- 
lateral symptoms of advanced general lipo- 
matosis is arteriosclerosis, with special ref- 
erence to that of premature character. In 
corpulent people the modification of the ves- 
sels, characterized by reduced elasticity of 
the vascular walls and depressed contractility 
of their smooth muscular fibres, occurs far 
more frequently and at a much earlier period 
of life than in others. The primary cause of 
this frequent coincidence of arterio sclerosis 
and lipomatosis universalis is the plethoric 
form of corpulence arising from immoderate 
indulgence in food and drink in connection 
with insufficient bodily exercise. Gradu- 
ally and steadily arterial pressure is aug- 
mented, inducing permanent distortion and 
expansion of the arterial vessels and mechan- 
ical irritation of their walls. The high- liver 
and gourmand, in similar fashion, promotes 
the multiplication of the fat-masses and the 
sclerotic modification of the vessels. But 
arterio-sclerosis cannot be regarded solely as 
a collateral symptom of general lipomatosis, 
since it is also a sequel. Anatomical re- 
searches justify the assumption that by mul- 
tiplication of the fat-cells in, and in close 
proximity to, the adventitious tissue of the 
arteries, a direct influence is exerted on the 
latter whereby arise sclerotic changes; fur- 
thermore, the clinical fact that the augmented 
accumulation of fat in the lower abdomen, in 
the mesentery, in the greater omentum, in the 
adipose capsule of the kidneys, etc , forms an 
impediment to the free movement of the 
blood in the intestinal vessels — an impedi- 
ment which subsequently leads to increased 
engorgement in the entire arterio vascular 
system — explains the genesis of arterio-scle- 
rosis in the corpulent. A further etiological

In the plethoric form of corpulence another 
. promotive influ- 
viz , arthritis; nor should syphilis be 
ignored in this connection. 

When arterii 1 corpulence are 

coincident, the former imparts a peculiarity 
to the symptoms which are caused by the 
jsive accumulation of fat in the body, 
.ally about the heart and within the 
cardiac muscle. This peculiarity finds its 
first expression In the behavior of the visible 
and palpable arteries, characteristic of arte- 
rio-sclerosis — the peripheral are thread like 
or serpentine, the palpable abnormally hard 
to the touch — as well as in the sphygmo- 
graphic tableau of arteria radialis, and then 
manifests itself in the heart symptoms. 

In the numerous sphygmographic tracings 
taken from very corpulent individuals, I have 
been struck with the frequency with which 
the tracings of pulse-curves exhibit the first 
signs of increased vascular tension and sug- 
gest the presence of arterio-sclerosis; these 
are curves which reveal a steep and rapidly 
rising line of ascension, the first elevations 
of elasticity being far more pronounced than 
normally and shooting upward materially 
higher toward the apex of the curve. Of 700 
corpulent people, from whom were made ac- 
curate sphygmic curves, I found in no (16. 1 
per cent.) a pulse that revealed increase of 
vascular tension through arterio-sclerosis. 

In very advanced arterio-sclerosis of the 
corpulent the pulse-tableau of the disease is, 
in rare instances, characterized by tardiness: 
with a low line of ascension, the summit 
of the curve is flat, smooth, yes even round 
and semicircular; the elevation of the back- 
ward beat being scarcely indicated, and the 
elevations of elasticity in the descending 
line being lessened or absent. At times a 
material retardation of the pulse is joined 
therewith. 

The heart of the corpulent — the food-fat- 
tening heart, as I have termed it — is one 
whose function seems to be interfered with 
by the increase of bodily weight and growth 
of fatty tissue, and on whose working capacity 
new demands are made by the new vascular 



which ar;- 
fat ThU inters in arterio- 

.i new, matei impediment which 
ts propelling power. The inert 
labor of the heart is manifested by shortness 
of breath and distress following any con- 
siderable muscular effort, protracted walking, 
mounting of stairs, etc. Objectively, we have 
symptoms of hypertrophy of the left ven- 
tricle — in consequence of augmented resist- 
ance offered its evacuation into the B 
system; abnormal resistance of the apex- 
thrust; strengthening of the second tone 
over the aorta, at times a ringing character 
being perceptible therein. Sclerosis of the 
arteries also promotes the development of 
cardiac asthma and of attacks of angina 
pectoris in the corpulent, although it can by 
no means be regarded as the sole cause of 
these ominous symptoms. 

Coincident arteriosclerosis in the corpulent 
is, however, undoubtedly dangerous to life, 
in that it frequently gives rise to encephalor- 
rhagias. In the arterial augmentation of 
blood -pressure and in the rigidity of the 
small arteries lies the cause of the fact that 
haemorrhageof the brain hangs, like the sword 
of Damocles, over the heads of even such 
corpulent subjects as show very slight cardiac 
symptoms and apparently feel well. It falls 
very suddenly and unexpectedly when there 
occurs any casual augmentation of the al- 
ready high arterial tension or elevation of 
the venous blood-pressure and thereby, in- 
directly, of the arterial. % Psychic excite- 
ment, excesses with wine or women, great 
muscular effort, or, on the other hand, strain- 
ing at stool, violent sneezing, crying or laugh- 
ing, all are the immediate source of brain 
haemorrhage in the corpulent, and to this 
extent arterio-sclerosis is the cause of sudden 
death. 

A deleterious influence is exerted by arterio- 
sclerotic modification, when a collateral symp- 
tom of corpulence, on the kidneys, which, in 
lipomatous individuals, frequently do not 
need this factor to place them in a condition 
of passive hyperremic congestion. Then fol- 
low inflammatory infiltrations with the famil- 
iar sequel-symptoms, proceeding to complete 
atrophy of the kidney. These renal symp- 
toms are exhibited most frequently and 
strikingly in the drinking corpulent. Corpu-

lent aicohol-users often, therefore, succumb 
with symptoms of granular atrophy of the 
kidneys. 

It is therefore important for the physician, 
in examining corpulent patients, always to 
attend closely to the collateral symptom of 
arterio-sclerosis. The latter will be encoun- 
tered with surprising frequency. The autopsy 
has also established the frequent coincidence 
of arterio-sclerosis and lipomatosis univer- 
salis. Among eighteen cases, in which lipo- 
matosis universalis with its sequelae was 
necessarily considered the cause of death 
(the autopsies are described in detail in my 
monograph on Corpulence), arterio-sclerosis 
was present in thirteen cases — more than two- 
thirds — and in comparatively younger indi- 
viduals, aged respectively 29, 41, 47, and 48 
years.

A METAPHYSICAL STUDY. 



As down the avenue I took my way 

Afoot — my wheel kyphosis had that day — 

I met a weary man, a man of care, 

With shambling feet and Jin-de-siecle air, 

A carpenter who'd covered leagues of ground 

In searching for the job he never found. 

"Good morning, sir," quoth I, " thy looks suggest 

The funeral march of Saul and all the rest 

Of Israel. What has happened to destroy 

The April aspect of thy spirit's joy?" 

'twas a touching sight that pleasant morn 
To see the tears course down his nose forlorn, 
As, straightening up his manly six-feet-one, 

He said: " Heardst thou not what the fire hath 

done? 
Yestreen its flames made all the heavens red 
And turned six hundred families out of bed." 
"Too bad!" I said, — "but there's a job for you." — 

1 looked, and he had vanished from my view. 
"Surely," said I, "my carpenter's gone back 
To Mars, Altruria, or — Pontiac." 

I strayed into a cobbler's shop to see 

What Art could do to mend a sole for me, 

And as I hung my hat upon the floor 

The shoe repairer heaved a sigh most sore 

And let a great round tear fall down and stain 

The apron that he wore. "It looks like rain," 

I ventured. But he answered not a word. 

I saw his feelings were most strangely stirred. 

He rallied. "Ah, mein frendt, haf you not heard," 

He said, "of what dose school insbectors done? 

Dey puy sdone-grafel und pile tvendy ton 

Or less all ofer vere der shildren blay — 



Now vas that not a purty time off day? 
Dose leedle shildrens make so many holes 
Deir shoes in, also vear oudt all deir soles, 
Pecause some beeples like to make an ass of 
Demselves, und paint von sign: ' Blease keep der 

Grass Off."' 
"That may be very true," I said, "but still 
The injured shoes are money in your till — 
Is it not so ?" He shivered thereupon, 
And said: "Your shoes to-morrow vill be done." 

So odd this sympathy appeared, I said, 

Sub rosa: "Am I in or out of bed? 

Do people of this character exist, 

Or am I, maybe, a somnambulist?" 

I pinched myself. It really hurt. I was 

Awake; and while my brain was in a buzz 

I called to see my doctor and to pay 

A bill that had been due since early May — 

'Twas now July, and I had money to burn, 

Being a poet. 

Said the M.D.: "I learn 
That fifteen sewers are to be repaired 
This summer. By the time the last is aired, 
There will be seventy cases of typhoid 
And eighty of diphtheria. I'm employed 
To write a screed for Saturday's Free Press 
Reciting man's contagious illnesses 
And how to head them off. But what am I, 
What is the Medical Society, 
What are Professor Vaughan and Doc McLeod, 
The Pingree or the anti-Pingree crowd, 
Statistics, logic, pamphlets by the acre, 
Or even our own distinguished Doctor Baker, 
When on the other hand are sewers laid bare, 
Their deadly microbes reeking to the air 
In haste to fatten on the children's throats 
And ravage the November crop of votes ? 
What fools the balance of the people be ! 
We give them counsel, but because it's free 
They laugh at us, the laws of health neglect, 
And then get sick — what else could you expect? 
O then they call us; everything we say 
Is gospel to them then — they have to pay 
For it. Well, that is grist for our mill: 
They disobey us, and they get their fill 
Of independence. Then we must prescribe 
For money. While they perish, we survive. 
But we are born philanthropists: we long 
To see the babies fat, the mothers strong, 
Brothers and sisters dodge the dangerous stage, 
And all hands living to a ripe old age. 
Awake when others are asleep — or blinking — 
We burn the midnight oil in arduous thinking, 
As if were all men well 'twere none the worse for 

us — 
Concocting plans to make ourselves superfluous." 

That was a corker. But I sadly mused, 
While handing out the coin (which he refused 
Not): This is only one of the doctor men;

PARALYSIS.* 
BY D. O'DONOVAN, M D. 

Paralysis admits of five subdivisions, viz.: 
Cerebral, Spinal, Retlex, Hysterical, and 
Toxemic; and it is to the latter that I par- 
ticularly desire to call attention. Instead of 
attempting to give a detailed history of 
paralysis, I prefer to relate a few cases that 
have come under personal observation. 

First I will mention two somewhat peculiar 
cases — one that of a boy, fourteen years of 
age, who fell from a lumber-pile, striking 
upon the shoulders and the back of the head, 
with the result of complete paralysis of the 
body and lower extremities, from which 
after long treatment partial recovery result- 
ed—he is able to hobble about with the aid 
of a cane; the other a young man of power- 
ful physique, who, in attempting to prevent a 
saw log from rolling off a truck, was thrown 
to the ground with his head forced between 
his thighs, the log passing over him. That 
he was not instantly killed was due to the 
fact that a stump or root afforded some pro- 
tection; his back was broken about the 
region of the lower rib, and good union was 
had, yet complete paralysis of the lower ex- 
tremities resulted, and under the circum- 
stances death would have been preferable 
both to himself and friends. 

After fourteen years' experience in the 
profession I flattered myself that nothing 
relative to paralysis had escaped my observa- 
tion, but to my surprise I recently discovered 
a genuine case of palsy resultant upon a 
simple case of measles. I was called to see 
a child, ten years of age, in April, 1893, who 
exhibited the typical evidences of measles. 
A second visit only was required, at which

time the mother remarked she had escaped 
the disease in childhood, and considered her- 
self now too old to contract it, though I told 

igt could not be depended upon 
safeguard. 

Ten days later I :i summoned, this 

time to find the mother suffering from an 
unmistakable attack of the same malady, 
contracted from the child. Here again the 
usual remedies were administered. I cau- 
tioned regarding draughts, and promised to 
call the succeeding day. On the secom: 
to the mother I found the upper part of the 
body well covered with rash, but no un- 
toward symptom, hence did not deem it 
necessary to call again unless especially re- 
quested. A week later I was again sum- 
moned. Found patient still had traces of 
rash remaining; was able to get about the 
house, but only by the aid of chairs, table, or 
other piece of furniture; complained of a 
feeling of weakness; and as I supposed she 
was merely suffering from debility as a 
sequel to the malady, I prescribed nothing 
but elixir of iron, quinine, and strychnine. 

A day later found my patient in bed again, 
and the sense of weakness perceptibly in- 
creased; she was unable to clasp my hand 
with either of hers with any noticeable 
effect. I now suspected paralysis, and asked 
her to draw up her knees, which she was 
able to do with apparently little or no effort. 

The third day I found the patient to all 
appearances growing weaker, and unable to 
draw up her knees without manifest difficulty. 
The paralysis of the arms was also increased. 
I was giving quinine, nux vomica, and 
sicum. 

Two days later my patient was still weaker; 
the legs could no longer be drawn up un- 
aided, and the hands could scarcely be ex- 
tended. 

With another twenty-four hours the diffi- 
culty had still increased. At my seventh 
visit the hands were useless, the muscles of 
deglutition affected, motion of lower extrem- 
ities confined to ankles. 

On the eighth visit little change was noted, 
except that swallowing had become even 
more difficult; patient lay in a helpless con- 
dition, and liquid food was required; she was 
unable to drink, as the second swallow would 
be returned through the nose. 



THE MEDICAL AGE.

During the three succeeding days her con- 
dition was much the same, when counsel was 
summoned. My confrtre made a thorough 
examination of the premises, thinking sani- 
tary conditions might have something to do 
with the case, but no evidence of the kind 
could be elicited, and finally his judgment 
coincided with my own — that the paralysis 
was the sequel purely of poisoning of the 
system from measles. Potassium iodide was 
now administered, but after a few doses it 
had to be discontinued for an interval, when 
it was again resumed. 

When the patient seemed largely bereft of 
the sense of feeling, and her extremities 
powerless, a new symptom presented itself: 
every attempt to move the body resulted in 
extreme pain. For this I ordered liniment, 
and at the same time required the extremities 
to be enveloped in warm cotton, which in 
turn was covered with several thicknesses of 
flannel; even then, so bitterly did the invalid 
complain of cold, that it was found necessary 
to have recourse to water-bags, hot plates, 
etc. The last trace of fever having now dis- 
appeared, I ordered carbonate of iron, ex- 
tract of nux vomica, extract of cascara, resin 
of podophyllin, and powdered capsicum. 
After the feeling of pain had been practi- 
cally overcome I commenced using elec- 
tricity, at the same time returning again to 
the use of potassium iodide. Complete re- 
covery did not take place until the succeed- 
ing October. 

In the case just described there are three 
prominent features, viz.: good action of the 
bladder; extreme pain upon movement; and 
sense of cold in the lower extremities. 

It is interesting to note the efforts of Nature 
to bring. about functional use of the parts 
affected by paralysis, and it is also wonderful 
at times to witness the gradual return to 
normal condition in cases that have been 
deemed hopeless. And yet, upon the other 
hand, it not infrequently happens that after 
varied and long-continued treatment, patients 
suffering from the ailment just described pass 
from the care of one physician to another in 
practically the same condition as when first 
seen, baffling the best endeavors, and com- 
pelling the profession to admit its inability 
to successfully combat so dreaded a disease.

HORSE NETTLE IN EPILEPSY. 

Editor Medical Age: 

Thinking my experience with Horse Nettle 
in epilepsy may be of some interest, I report 
same as follows: 

About July 15th, 1895, there was brought 
to me a child, eleven years of age, the son of 
healthy parents whose family history is good. 
He had been suffering with epilepsy for three 
years, the attacks coming on every day and 
sometimes running up as high as twelve in a 
day; he had been gradually growing worse 
in spite of all treatment, the slightest exer- 
tion of any kind increasing the attacks and 
also the severity. The parents did not think 
there was any use trying to do anything for 
him. Just about this time my attention was 
directed to Solarium carolinense, and, though 
I had little hopes of it doing any good, I 
decided to try it. I began by giving one 
drachm of Parke, Davis &amp; Co.'s fluid extract 
four times a day. A few days later the 
father reported the patient "no better." I 
then increased the dose to two drachms four 
times a day. Still there was no apparent im- 
provement, and the patient's mother thought 
there was no use in attempting to do any- 
thing farther. However, I persuaded her to 
be patient, and again increased the dose, this 
time to one-half ounce, to be administered 
thrice daily. Now it was soon observed the 
"fits" were less frequent and not so severe. 
Nevertheless I advised increasing the dose 
to six drachms three times a day, but the 
only apparent effect was to cause drowsi- 
ness. On her own responsibility the mother 
now gave one ounce three times daily, 
and speedily the fits almost stopped. She 
then gave four ounces "once in a while," 
and since then the child has not had a single 
fit. 

After a time the dose was gradually de- 
creased. Now for more than two months 
the child has not had even the semblance or 
premonition of a fit. He potters about the 
farm without inconvenience to himself, doing 
light work. The remedy is still being taken 
— four drachms once a week; but I have 
ordered complete cessation at the end of a 
fortnight. Whether the trouble will again 
return or not remains to be seen, but I feel 
confident that if it does return a few doses 
of Horse Nettle will answer. 

Yours truly,

These remedies I have been using for 
twenty-five years — salol excepted, as it is not 
twenty five years old, — and they can be re- 
lied upon when given as indicated. When 
there is fullness of the tissues, I employ fluid 
extract Apocynum, especially when there is 
engorgement of spleen, liver, uterus, or serous 
membranes — and this includes certain forms 
of dropsy, — giving all that can be borne 
without moving the bowels too freely. As a 
heart remedy in the same class of cases in 
which digitalis, strophanthus, adonis or cactus 
is indicated, Apocynum in half-drop doses is 
never disappointing. Remember, far better 
effects can be obtained from most remedies 
by small doses frequently repeated than from 
large ones at longer intervals. Remedies 
often fail because the manner in which they 
are prescribed causes them to act intermit- 
tentlv, when a continuous effect is demanded.

AHBLYOPIA FROM CHOCOLATE. 

Doctor Casey A. Wood, in the Medical 
Record, reports a case of this character oc-

remarks: "This establishes beyond reason-

EXPERT MEDICAL TESTIHONY IN NEW 
YORK. 

During the present winter, in the State of 
New York, a systematic effort will be made 
to place the matter of expert testimony on a 
more satisfactory basis, and the Assembly 
will be asked to render illegal the giving of 
such testimony after the manner of the past. 

During the last five years the better mem- 
bers of the medical and legal professions 
have viewed with alarm the growing fre- 
quency of the introduction of so-called medr 
cal expert testimony in murder trials, and 
more particularly where the defense has set 
up the claim of insanity. As is well known, 
the rule has been to summon medical men of 
all classes, without reference to experience 
or knowledge, and it is notorious that in 
many instances the so called experts have 
been bribed or hired to present opinions 
favorable to one particular side of the case, 
the scientifically discoverable facts being re- 
duced to a position of secondary importance. 

The new bill, which will be presented dur- 
ing the coming session, claims to have been 
drawn up by "representative members of the 
profession," and aims to be very radical. We 
understand it is intended, if possible, to lodge 
the sole right to give medical testimony in 
courts, in a non-partisan Board appointed by 
the Governor, subject to the approval of the 
Senate. The province of the members of 
this Board will be to act as instructors and 
advisors to the courts; and at the same time 
it is expected its membership will be suffi- 
ciently large to provide for all criminal trials, 



THE MEDICAL AGE.

the number required to constitute a quorum 
being small enough to allow sections of the 
Board to act in various localities at the same 
time. 

The Board is to be empowered to call for 
any evidence that promises to throw light 
upon a particular case; and when any section 
of the Board disagrees, the whole body will 
be called together for decision. Under no 
circumstances will any medical man, not a 
member of the Board, be allowed to testify 
in any court, except upon questions of simple 
fact, like any other witness; but such may be 
summoned to give evidence before the Board. 

This is to a certain extent a move in the 
right direction. It has before been pointed 
out in The Medical Age that the office of 
Coroner as ordinarily filled should be abol- 
ished, and the functions of the office be per- 
formed by a salaried medical man— as in 
Massachusetts, — to be known as a Medical 
Examiner. There seems to be no good reason 
why also the individuals who serve as medical 
examiners in any judicial district should not 
also supply the place of medical experts and 
act in a non-partisan way as advisors of the 
court. 

Regarding the bill which is to be presented 
to the New York Assembly, as now outlined 
it presents one very weak point. It is gotten 
up by a class of specialists, inasmuch as it is 
demanded the Board shall be recruited from 
"the ranks of expert alienists alone," though 
the plea is added that these are to be "men 
having a high ascertained qualification." 
The qualifications of an expert, however, de- 
mand something more than mere ability to 
pass upon the sanity or insanity of an ac- 
cused person. Alienists are no more compe- 
tent to pass upon matters of expert pathology, 
microscopy, and chemistry, than are other 
practitioners. Insanity is but one of the 
many pleas that require the careful attention 
of the court; further, the majority of so- 
called experts are men who have made their 
reputation on the basis of articles contributed 
to the medical press or to medical societies, 
and who consequently are likely to err in 
those points which are most familiar to the 
general practitioner. 

What is required as an aid to the courts, is 
a Board of gentlemen of broad medical edu- 
cation — men who shall be familiar with chem- 



istry and microscopy as well as psychiatry, 
and also with the different phases presented 
by surgical and general medical cases. ( )f 
what value would be the evidence of an 
alienist in determining, for example, whether 
in a particular case death is to be attributed 
to cholera morbus or to arsenic ? It is certain 
that the requirements of an expert Board 
cannot be filled by alienists; and it is to be 
hoped the bill to be presented before the 
New York Legislature will be so amended 
as to require the Board of Experts to be 
made up of medical men of thorough general 
education, and not merely of class specialists. 
Indeed, it is doubtful, if the bill should pass 
as contemplated, whether it would not defeat 
the very object for which it is proposed, for 
it is certain no court can uphold acts which 
constitute class legislation. 



FIGURES THAT DO NOT STARTLE. 

A somewhat pretentious paper, emanating 
from the pen of a Hanoverian physician, ap- 
peared in a recent number of the Deutsche 
Medicinische Wochenschrift, lauding a certain 
German preparation of iron and manganese; 
the caption is '-A Contribution to Iron Ther- 
apy and Researches into the Blood (Blutun- 
tersuchung)." It has an appearance of learn- 
ing, bristles with impressive citations, and 
last, but not least, presents an array of im- 
posing percentages. From some of the latter 
the readers of The Medical Age can extract 
a little amusement. 

Par exe?nple: The author declares the chief 
value of the product is " unquestionably based 
on its content of the inorganic constituents 
of the blood, since to introduce these into 
the economy along with the food is more 
difficult than to provide access for an aug- 
mented ration of albumen." He also cites 
Biernacki as asserting "anaemia is due to 
poverty of the blood in inorganic constitu- 
ents." 

But what is this startling array of blood- 
salts, found in this preparation ? To our 
surprise, it is designated as 0.016 gramme in 
a single dose — a tablespoonful, — or, in other 
words, one-tenth of o?ie per cent.! Of this 
amount, seventy- five per cent. — we employ 
the author's own figures— or 0.012 gramme, 
is alkaline earth phosphates; 1 wenty per cent., 






THE MEDICAL AGE. 



or 0.0012 gramme, alkali phosphates; hv 
cent., or o.oooS gramme, alkaline chlorides ! 
When it is realized that t -^////per- 

centage of phosphates 1 by the 

proportion of blood salts present and avail- 
able in drinking-waters and in the common- 
est food, it becomes a natural query: What 
is the value of such a preparation, especially 
as this is the point insisted upon as the chief 
for therapeutic value"' According to 
the evidence presented by the author, the 
most common dietary would be the best pos- 
sible therapeutic reliance, and one beside 
which the new medicament would be cast 
into obscurity. To be sure, in order to com- 
mend the product and make an imposing 
ng, it has received the high-sounding 
baptismal title of " Normal Saccharated Solu- 
tion of Iron Manganese," but big words 
"butter no parsnips." 

The height of absurdity is reached when 
the claims for a medicament are based on 
the proportion of constituents that must play 
an insignificant part in any preparation, espe- 
cially when it offers no advantages over the 
ordinary iron and manganese medicaments 
in every- day use. The latter have rendered 
excellent service in the past, and are not 
likely to be superseded by an inert German 
preparation, even when possessed of a mouth- 
filling appellation and the claim of an in- 
finitesimal proportion of blood salts. 



HAIR TURNED FROM WHITE TO BLACK 
BY COLD. 

An engineer in the 1'ire Department of 
Louisville, age sixty-five years, was on duty 
during the tremendous fire in January last 
for fifteen consecutive hours. From two or 
three sections of hose near his engine the 
spray was constantly flying, and he became 
covered from head to foot with ice. He 
wore a skull-cap, and a helmet atop of that, 
so that his head was the warmest part of his 
body and not at all exposed, though his eye- 
brows and whiskers became wet and were 
frozen stiff. The afternoon after the ex- 
posure his hair, which had become gray eight 
years before, and had for three years been 
white, turned perfectly black. Formerly he 
was a blonde. Doctor George W. Griffith, 
who reports this case in the Join rn 



Cutaneous athi Genito Diseases, and 

who has known the man for f ^. de- 

Clares that the hair is oily and not in the 
dead, and that the patient's head has 
been very carefully scrubbed several times 
under the supposition the change in color 
might possibly be due to foreign matter. 
Numbers of cases have been report- 
which the hair has suddenly turned from 
black to white, but this is the first ins; 
we believe, known to literature, in which the 
reverse has occurred. Campagne tells of a 
woman, thirty-six years of age, in whom the 
hair began to blanch on the twenty-third day 
of a severe fever, and six days later was per- 
fectly white; on the seventh day, how 
the color began to darken, and in the course 
of a week the hair had recovered its origi- 
nal color. Van Harlingen narrates the case 
of an idiotic epileptic girl of thirteen years, 
who experienced changes in the color of her 
hair in consonance with her periods of agita- 
tion and calmness; sometimes the color was 
blonde, at other times red, and the variations 
in shade were great. Falkenheim, also, re- 
ports a man of thirty-three, whose hair was 
variegated, being in irregular portions of the 
scalp colorless and pigmented. In all cases 
reported by Wilson the ringed hairs were 
divided into quite regular bands. 



EDITORIAL NOTES. 



Oh! Oh!— 

The following opening of a paper in one 
of our exchanges is "a light" by far too val- 
uable to be "hidden under a bushel:" 

The abstrusity of conditions in an atomic aggre- 
gation of organic elements wherein automatism is 
exhibited, too often transcends the finite compre- 
hension of the most intuitively endowed and eru- 
dite pedagogue or scholar, and we are left to 
about in darkness and danger in considering local 
or apparent pathological manifestations, whose 
origin occurs in such rem. ming incongru- 

ous ways that the alert diagnostician is astonished 
at the great remove the object of his direc: 
prehension bears to the initiatory derangement, 
and whose insidious pri ids on to vital 

abnegation or transmutation, beyond which vicari- 
ous intermediation will not retrieve. 

Under the above caption of life's functional ad- 
version we are invited to contemplate, to a limited 
extent, the prevalent expression of vital degeneracy

noticeable about the cirvo-gingival margins, and 
go back with the author to a remote inceptive prin- 
ciple of life to find the original seed of this mem- 
branous enemy. 

. . . . Successful construction and perpetu- 
ity of any organic structure depend upon harmoni- 
ous association of formative substances in cell 
individuality. This condition can only be exhibited 
by the necessary supply of proximate elements 
within the zone of their vital attraction. The 
latitude of cell action displayed in the result of 
their construction shows imperfection in proportion 
to the incongruous accretions they are forced to 
carry forward to their terminal destiny, and the 
unenduring result of the finish. Each anatomical 
division represents distinctive original character- 
istics, some with more attenuated histological con- 
struction, requiring a correspondingly delicate vital 
current of the purest composition to sustain up to 
the functional standard of physical welfare of the 
parts considered. Others supplied by the same 
blood stream require and obtain elements of en- 
tirely different chemico-vital composition. 

What shall be done to a man like this? Is 
there any wonder that insane asylums are 
multiplied ? If the intent is to " make trade " 
by fracturing the artificial dentures of readers, 
a fair measure of success is assured. 

Value of a Black Cat.— 

We have heard of a black cat skin poultice 
as a sovereign remedy for pneumonia and 
kindred maladies; also that a black cat was 
quite essential to the work of certain old bel- 
dams who sought notoriety as witches; but of 
its full black, or black-art, value we have but 
just been informed. A few weeks since an 
Austrian Pole was killed upon the Lake Shore 
Railway near Dunkirk, N. Y., and at the 
"crowner's quest" a Polish acquaintance ac- 
counted for the presence of the deceased in 
this locality, as follows: 

He would not work, but spent his time looking 
for a black cat without a single hair of other color. 
He knew that if he could find such a perfectly black 
cat, and would take it to a cross-road at midnight, 
put it in boiling water, and then take a certain bone 
from the animal, it would make him invisible when- 
ever he desired to be unseen. With that bone in his 
possession he intended to walk into a bank, and 
rob it in the presence of all the officers; he could go 
into a brewery and drink all the beer he wished; 
and in fact he would make himself and all his 
friends rich by unseen robbery. 

The coroner obtained confirmation of this 
story by finding a number of cat's bones in 
the trunk of the deceased at his boarding- 



house. It is evident the police must now be 
up in the black art — mere dirty work is alto- 
gether insufficient. 

Antidote to Carbolic Acid.— 

Doctor Edmund Carleton — who is corrobo- 
rated by Doctor C. S. Kinney, of the Insane 
Hospital at Middletown, Connecticut — de- 
clares the antidote to carbolic acid is to be had 
in every well ordered household, and is noth- 
ing more than simple cider vinegar. Knowl- 
edge of its specific worth came by accident. 
One day, while making some experiments with 
the pure acid, an unlucky movement sent two 
ounces of it into his hand, and though in two 
seconds he had the hand under a stream of 
water and washed it well, it became white and 
numb. There seemed to be no escape from 
the usual result — desquamation, and slow 
recovery of the sense of touch. But the odor 
was persistent and unpleasant, and, in the be- 
lief that it might be changed, a servant was 
sent for a cup of cider vinegar. While bath- 
ing and rubbing the affected parts with vine- 
gar, to the amazement of Doctor Carleton 
there was complete restoration of color and 
function. In five minutes nothing remained 
in evidence except the modified odor. 

Dealing from analogy, the inference is 
drawn that the acetic acid of the shops will 
prove equally satisfactory. Also attention is 
drawn to the fact that the bleaching and an- 
aesthesia arising from carbolic acid closely 
simulate leprosy. 

A Simple Code of Ethics.— 

In his address to the graduating class of 
the University of Pennsylvania, Doctor H. 
C. Wood laid down a simple code, the gist of 
which is as follows: 

Consider every member of the profession 
as one of your own family and having an in- 
herent right to your medical services, but do 
not abuse this right; consider any discovery 
or invention you may make as belonging to 
the general profession; never in any way 
laud your own medical skill or attempt to 
supplant in public or private estimation one 
of your medical brethren; join as soon as 
may be the incorporated companies of your 
fellows for scientific and social intercourse 
and for the cultivation of that professional 
conscience which often binds men more

In the December number of ThePraetit 

is a review of sir Henry Halford, who p 

famous court phys • \ &gt;. It 

is said Sir Henry was "essentially a clinician 
according to the lights of his day. The 
ne of his contemporaries, that 
rked himself into practice by Sir Per- 
tinax MacSycophant's policy of 'booing' to 
the great, has, it may be supposed, an ele- 
ment of truth, but it is not the whole truth. 
The mainspring of his success was that he 
acted upon the principle laid down by him- 
self—that the cure of disease is the physi- 
cian's object, and he must not allow anything 
to divert his eye from that great mark." 

That the cure of disease is the true busi- 
ness of the physician is manifest, yet the fact 
seems to be in some danger of being forgot- 
ten in these days when the laboratory is all- 
powerful, and bacteriology the acme of all 
knowledge. 

Pilocarpine as Prophylactic of Diphtheria.— 

In the Wiener Medizinische Presse Doctor 
Sziklai shows that pilocarpine is not only a 
certain and rapid remedy for diphtheria, but 
that it may be used as a prophylactic in epi- 
demics, especially in homes in which a mem- 
ber of the family is already attacked. The 
prophylactic properties are also remarkable 
in croup and in pseudo-diphtheritic affections 
of the larynx. The author has used this 
remedy constantly during three years, and 
sometimes in large doses without having 
seen any symptom arise of sufficient gravity 
to cause anxiety. He administers ten drops 
of a one-per-cent. solution of the hydrochlor- 
ate, three times a day; half this dose for chil- 
dren under one year. 

The Gums in the Diagnosis of Phthisis. - 

A red line on the gums is, according to the 
observation of Doctor Andreesen, of Yalta, 
frequently present in the subjects of pulmo- 
nary tubercle. Of eight hundred patients 
examined with reference to this sign, it was 
present in ninety-two.

Pleasant Recognition.— 

John S. Billings, late 1 &gt;eputy Sur-

$10,000 duly enclosed in a silver box, bearing 
the following inscription: "From 259 phys 
cians of the United States and Great Britain, 
in grateful recognition of services to medical 
scholars." 

The "recognition" referred to the incep- 
tion and publication of the Index Catalogue, 

iVtaragliano Serum. — 

The Boston Medical and Surgical Journal 
declares that an Italian physician of New 
York, who attended the recent Medical Con- 
gress at Rome, brought home'with him some 
of Maragliano's anti tubercular serum, and 
claims to have used it with favorable results 
in three cases. The impression, however, 
gained from European exchanges, is that this 
serum is possessed of no value. 

Strychnine in Pneumonia.— 

In a report just issued, Surgeon-General 
Tryon, of the Navy, declares that "The 
favorable opinion entertained of strychnine 
in the treatment of pneumonia has been fur- 
ther strengthened by the experience in its use 
during the past year. Forty-five cases of 
acute lobar pneumonia were treated in the 
Naval Hospital in Brooklyn during the past 
twenty-four months, with thirteen deaths." 

New Journals.— 

Several new medical publications have re- 
cently appeared, or are to appear during the 
coming thirty days. The American Medical 
Review, a very creditable appearing periodi- 
cal, has already reached our table, and ap- 
parently, from the number of announcements, 
the end of" medical journals is not yet.

At last a full subscription list has been se- 
cured, and this journal will speedily reappear.

Items and News, 



Diphtheria Antitoxin as a Culture fledium for 
the Diphtheria Bacillus.— 

It is suggested that the heat required to 
coagulate the antitoxin destroys its bacteri- 
cidal properties, but if that is so diphtheria 
bacilli ought to die when floating on fresh 
antitoxin and kept at a body temperature. 
On the contrary, I am afraid that the mi- 
crobes would not only survive the treatment, 
but thrive upon it. 

It has been held that we must look to 
Metschnikoff's theory for the true success of 
the action of antitoxin; that this product 
when introduced into the body stimulates 
"the living phagocytic cells." Now if this 
explains the remedial process, antitoxin must 
act either as a general stimulant or as a spe- 
cial stimulant. If it acts as a general stimu- 
lant to the phagocytes through the economy, I 
cannot see in what way diphtheria antitoxin 
differs in its action from half a score of other 
remedies, such as quinine or iron, which have 
at various times been credited with similar 
qualities. If, on the other hand, it is a spe- 
cial stimulant, and prompts these little bodies 
to devour Klebs-Loeffler bacilli and their tox- 
ins, many will consider that we are asked to 
mentally assimilate not only Metschnikoff's 
theory, but "rudis indigestaque moles" besides.

nal. 

[This appears to be a question which a few 
simple experiments would settle. — Ed] 

Sugar and the Teeth.— 

Doctor Vaughan Harley, in the Physiology 
Section of the British Medical Association, 
read a paper upon " Sugar as a Food," and, 
in addition to praising its virtues, denied 
some of the vices generally ascribed to this 
substance. He declared the popular view 
that sugar ruins the teeth is not borne out 
by observation; that people accustomed to 
take large quantities are not more liable to 
have bad teeth, but, on the contrary, have in 
many cases exceptionally fine ones; in sup- 
port of this contention he cited the negroes 
of the West Indies, who are in the habit of 
taking large quantities of sugar and whose 
teeth are unexcelled as to soundness and 
whiteness. — British Journal of Dental Scien:e. 

Medical Women and the Royal College of 
Great Britain.— 

The narrow majority by which the College 
of Physicians refuses to admit women is 
simply a last desperate flourish of the mop 



by the Mrs. Partington of medicine; the dear 
old lady would have done better to yield 
gracefully to the inevitable. The obsolete 
controversial weapons ustd against the med- 
ical amazons recall the bows and arrows of 
the u Children of the Mist," which so much 
amused Rittenmaster Dugald Dalgetty. I 
confess I do not see why the women are so 
anxious to get into the college, unless it be 
for the satisfaction of capturing the last 
citadel of the profession. It is certain, how- 
ever, that now the men have shown a wish 
to keep them out, they will never rest til] 
they get in. — Ce que femme veut. — Editorial in 
The Practitioner. 

A Curious Accident.— 

A " broken nose " is not an uncommon oc- 
currence, but separation of the whole of the 
upper jaw from the skull is worthy of record. 
Mr. Hopkins reports a case admitted into the 
Swansea Hospital, of a man aged forty- nine, 
struck by a wooden beam on the back of the 
head and knocked forward against a coal 
truck so that the edge caught him at the 
root of the nose. The nasal and zygomatic 
processes were fractured, the superior max- 
illary bones both detached, and there was 
separation in the middle line of more than 
an inch. The frontal sinus and anterior eth- 
moidal ceils were opened up, but the eyes 
escaped injury. The parts were kept in 
very good position by using a Smith's gag, 
which was worn continuously for a fortnight. 
— British Journal of Dental Science. 

Second Sight. — 

Doctor G. S. Ryerson narrated to the To- 
ronto Clinical Society the case of a woman 
aged seventy- eight, for some years a sufferer 
from defective vision, who suddenly, one 
night when at church, felt something strange 
happen to her eyes, and upon looking at her 
prayer-book found she could read readily with- 
out glasses. The Doctor found upon testing 
the eyes that the sight was very good. He had 
always been very skeptical regarding the ap- 
pearance of second sight, but this appeared 
to be a bona fide case, due probably to a 
swelling of the lens. — Canadian Medical Re- 



Danger in Nicotine Fumigations.— 

Doctor Fisher calls attention in an English 
newspaper to the danger of using nicotine 
fumigating liquids in fruit-houses where the 
fruit is required for immediate consumption.

marked symptoms of nicotism after partaking 
of some grapes from a vinery in which nico-

Worth Remembering.— 

Medicine lacks much of being a fixed sci- 
ence, and the startling bigotry that leads to 
dogmatic hate and slander should be despised 
by all members of the profession — it is a cry- 
ing shame to our most noble calling. The 
bigot in religion is to a shameful degree in- 
tolerant, but a bigot in medicine is intolerant 
to an infinite degree. In remaining a bigot 
he will never receive knowledge, because he 
deems himself already wise. — I. J. M. ("&gt;■ 

The Retort Pertinent.— 

A young physician who has just established 
himself, and with very little practice, is noted 
for his braggadocio. One of the older phy- 
sicians, meeting him on the street the other 
day, asked how he was coming on. "I have 
got more than I can attend to," was the 
boastful reply; "I had to get out of my bed 
five times last night."

The Poultice.— 

This has recently been examined by Doctor 
R. \V. Lovell, and he happily finds that it is 
"reasonably sterile and non-pathogenic." It" 
would be hard indeed if the soulless searchers 
after microbes were to lay the ban upon this 
most comfortable and useful domestic rem- 
edy. How few mortals pass through this

A new sign in tabes dorsalis is lack of pain 
when violent sion of the ulnar nerve

finger is felt. This condition is present in 
seventy-five per cent. 1 and occurs in 

no other form of organic disease that may 
be mistaken for this, (Uiernacki.) — Omaha 
Clinic. 

Cleaning Rusty Instruments.— 

Brodie gives the following as an effective 
method of cleaning rusty instruments: Im- 
merse in a solution of chloride of tin in dis- 
tilled water, allowing to remain over night, 
then rub dry with chamois after rinsing with 
running water. They will be of a silvery 
brightness. — British Journal of Dental Science. 

Opium in Cough = Mixtures. — 

As a warning to all who are too ready to 
prescribe opiates in cough-mixtures, it should 
be noted that there are 1,500,000 individuals 
in the United States addicted to the habitual 
use of opium, and that many of these "opio- 
phagists" date their habit from the use of 
cough-mixtures. — Journal de Medecine. 

Potassium Iodide in Goitre.— 

At a recent meeting of the Societe de 
Therapeutique, M. Fernand called attention 
to the dangers of potassium when adminis- 
tered to one suffering with goitre; even very 
small doses may induce coryza, dyspnoea, 
diarrhoea, trembling, cachexia, with symp- 
toms of cardio-pulmonary paralysis. 

Doctor Smith.— 

This euphonious cognomen is the popular 
monosyllabic application of 1300 practicing 
physicians in the United States. — AT 
Record. 

Can't See It.— 

When the German pathologists have whit- 
tled a point down to nothing, they keep 
right on whittling. — Exchange. 

Words of Wisdom.— 

Nothing worse can happen to the reputa- 
tion of a book than to have it offered as a 

"premium." 

Soap.— 

Almost every kind of soap possesses excel- 
lent disinfectant properties.

Book Reviews, 



The Badminton Magazine. Price, 30 cents; $3.00 
per year. Longmans, Green &amp; Co., New York. 

The December number is even better than 
the four preceding, if such can be possible. 
Sir Herbert Maxwell, Bart., M.P., writes of 
" The Big Stag of Beinn Nan Nighean;" Mon- 
tagu Shearman of "International Athletics;" 
J. M. Paulton, M.P., of " Recollections of 
the Cambridge Drag;" Maxwell Witham of 
"Skating Gossip;" Horace Hutchinson of 
"The Sportsman at School" — this paper 
offers more than a suspicion that the same 
gentleman is the author of "When We were 
Boys," which has appeared in several maga- 
zines; " The Story of an Orchid" is by Fred- 
erick Boyle; "A Run," by Alfred E. T. 
Watson, carries the reader into the hunting- 
field with all its vicissitudes, and enables him 
fairly to appreciate the situation of the fox 
when he finds all his arts and tricks are un- 
equal to throwing off the hounds; "Sport in 
Victoria" is by the Earl Hopetoun; " Ski- 
lobning in Norway" — pronounced She-lowb- 
ing — is by Mrs. Alec Tweedie; "Five Miles 
from Anywhere" is by Hedley Peek. Then 
follow the usual "Notes" by Rapier. The 
illustrations are in part from photographs; 
the remainder are by Thorburn, Berkeley, 
Davis, Brock, Jalland, Ashton, Speed, Gibb, 
and Linsell. Especially notable is a tail 
piece, a dolphin jumping, from a photograph 
from life. The other head and tail pieces, 
each of which is an art treasure, are from the 
collection of Mr. Hedley Peek, and we are 
happy to learn the supply is far from being 
exhausted. Verily there has never been so 
delightful a magazine as the Badminton.

acter and Influence of the Year's Building;" 
"New York State Association of Builders;"

The Youth's Companion. Price, $1.75 per year. 
Perry Mason &amp; Co., Boston. 

It is impossible within the limits of a re- 
view to do justice to the interesting an- 
nouncements made by the Youth's Companion 
for the coming year. Not only do the most 
delightful story- writers and ablest authors of 
the age contribute to the paper, but many of 
the most eminent statesmen, jurists and sci- 
entists of the world. No fewer than three 
Cabinet ministers are announced as contribu- 
tors for 1896, among them the Secretary of 
Agriculture, who will discuss "Arbor Day;" 
Secretary Herbert, on "What the President 
of the United States Does;" and Secretary 
Hoke Smith, on "Our Indians." In a fasci- 
nating group of articles under the head of 
" How I Served My Apprenticeship," Frank 
R. Stockton tells how he became an author, 
General Nelson A. Miles gives reminiscences 
of his army days, and Andrew Carnegie re- 
calls his earliest struggles in getting a busi- 
ness footing. 

The publishers of the Companion offer new 
subscribers who will at once remit $1.75, a 
handsome four- page calendar for 1896 (seven 
by ten inches), lithographed in nine colors 
(of the retail value of fifty cents), the 
Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's 
'double numbers, and the Youth's Companion

with the method; yet even this is less appar 
ent than in the majority of illustrations of the

"U. By Lawrence L. Lynch. Paper; large 
; Price, 25 cents. Rand, McXally 
&amp; Co., Chicago. 

Purported "detective " books have multi- 
plied so fast of late years that the very sug- 
gestion thereof often tends to nausea, and 
that too in spite of the fact Conan Doyle has 
recently turned his attention to this class of 
literature. But Doyle's cleverness is sadly at 
fault in the exploitation of the marvellous in 
the detective line, since he considers the 
denouement first, and working backward fits 
the plot thereto — a procedure not calculated 
to favor the best literary work. By compari- 
son Lawrence Lynch is the better author; 
his tales, however, are of detection rather than 
"detectives," and this last work is certainly 
superior to anything that has hitherto ema- 
nated from his pen. Indeed there are few 
modern novels so thoroughly satisfactory as 
"No Proof." There is nothing to slur or 
skip, no hanging of the tale, no loss of inter- 
est; the plot works steadily and evenly, until 
the culmination is reached near the final page; 
and the climax, though somewhat startling 
and dramatic, is very far from being common- 
place.

j v York. 

'Phis new story will be heartily welcomed 
by all admirers of Scottish tradition and lit- 
erature, for Mr. Crockett is even in a wa) a 
rival of the great Sir Walter. The see 
laid in the part of Auld Scotia that Mr. 
Crockett has mortgaged for literary pur- 
poses, and the movement of the tale is quite 
in keeping with the author's previous literary 
efforts. Put the new volume is none the less 
welcome for being thus characteristic. \ 
(ialloway Herd " is a love story dealing with 
peasant characters, and the incidents have to 
do chiefly with the young wife and child of 
the scapegrace son of a Scotch minister. 
The story opens at the deathbed of the son in 
London, an old Scotch neighbor having found 
his way to the scene. Subsequently the young 
mother and child are installed in the farm- 
house of this good old Scotchman, Sandy 
McQuhirr. The proper rewards and pun- 
ishments are dealt out, and the book ends 
brightly and hopefully.

ship of James T. Whittaker, Ml)., of Cincin-

THE MEDICAL AGE. 



Anglo-Urdu. By Reverend George Small, M.A., 

and Surgeon-General C. R. Francis, M.B., M.R. 

C.P. and S., L.S.A. Medical handbook; cloth; 

i6mo; pp. 200. Thacker, Spink &amp; Co., Calcutta. 

This is a handbook of Hindustani, pub- 
lished with special reference to medical prac- 
titioners, pharmacists, missionaries, etc., who 
purpose entering the field of Northern India. 
Such a work must prove of great value to 
these, prior to leaving home, and will furnish 
abundant material for primary grounding in 
the language, though a grammar would sub- 
sequently require to be added. A work of 
the latter character in Romanized letters by 
the same author is also published by the same 
house. 

The work is of great practical value to 
pharmacists, chemists, and physicians who 
desire to familiarize themselves with Hindu- 
stanese synonyms and Oriental medicine, for 
one of its most valuable constituents is a 
descriptive catalogue of native remedies ar- 
ranged alphabetically, in connection with 
which appears much detailed material that 
can nowhere else be found. 



The Wish. By Hermann Sudermann. Paper; 
i2mo; pp. 296. Price, 25 cents. Rand, McNally 
&amp; Co., Chicago and New York. 

This, No. 218 of the ever popular Globe 
Library, is somewhat weird and startling in 
character, dealing as it does with the crimes 
— if such they may be called — of mentality. 
A girl finds herself in love with her brother- 
in-law, and, when her married sister is upon 
her death-bed, is frightened by discovering 
that she entertains an imperfectly but yet pal- 
pably defined wish that she may die.. The 
expiation begins with the realization of this 
wish, and consists of self-denial and refusal 
of the sister's husband; and when in a mo- 
ment of passion she reveals her love to its 
object, the upbraidings of conscience drive 
her to suicide. 



Hand Book for Hospitals. By Amy Howard 

Woolsey. Third edition. Cloth; i6mo. Price, 

75 cents. G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York. 

The value of the publication may be judged 

by the fact it is now in its third edition, the 

first having been issued in 1887. No other 

work can be found that can supply its place, 

and it was especially written for the use of 

visitors of the New York State Charities Aid 

Association. 



The North American Review. 

Among special features of extraordinary impor- 
tance which this well known review has in prep- 
aration for 1896 is a series of articles by the Right 
Honorable W. E. Gladstone on '' The Future State, 
and the Condition of Man in it." The series will 
begin in the January number. 



Therapeutic Brevities. 

Ferratin. — Professor Schmiedeberg has 
succeeded in producing this substance by 
artificial means, in the form of a fine powder 
of red-brown color, like oxide of iron. Two 
forms are known to commerce — the one 
simple and insoluble in water, the other a 
sodium compound which readily dissolves on 
stirring after being allowed to stand a little 
while in water. The latter must be as free 
as possible from lime, otherwise an insoluble 
calcium compound is formed. Ferratin, in 
contradistinction to those compounds of iron 
hitherto in use, is readily assimilated and 
does not produce any unpleasant disturbances 
in either the gastric or enteric functions, 
even when used for a lengthy period; indeed, 
in some cases its exhibition seems to produce 
improvement in the appetite and regularity 
in defaecation. As a portion of the substance 
is decomposed by the acid gastric juice and 
also by sulphuretted hydrogen, a sufficient 
quantity of Ferratin must be ingested to 
leave an overplus in the bowel-tract so that 
the organism may pick up as much as it re- 
quires. There is no necessity whatever to 
anticipate overloading of the organism with 
the iron, as absorption and excretion appear 
to be mutually controlling. Excretion does 
not take place through the kidneys. The 
daily dose for adults is fifteen to thirty 
grains; acids should be avoided, but no 
other restrictions are necessary. Schmiede- 
berg points out that Ferratin is first and 
foremost a food, and its use is indicated in 
all cases in which nutrition and blood-forma- 
tion are unsatisfactory. 

Banholzer, of Eichhorst's clinic, declares 
that in anaemia following acute disease the 
haemoglobin was quickly increased five per 
cent, in eight days, as also the number of red 
cells, by Ferratin; and in chlorosis the same 
results were visible in even a more marked 
degree. The general condition was im- 
proved, the increase in weight in most cases 
considerable, and the good effects on the ap- 
petite were obvious. Harold found, in three 
cases of severe anaemia, the preparation ex- 
erted a remarkable haematinic effect; it did 
not interfere with digestion or produce any 
constitutional disturbance. In one of the 
patients, reduced iron had been given for 
twelve months without benefit. — Dujardin- 
Beaumetz, in Annual of the Universal Medi- 
cal Sciences.

appetite in woman; the general health, and

Nocturnal Enuresis. — Strumpf remarks that 
when a few drops of urine escape into the 
deep urethra a desire to urinate follows. 
Consequently he theorizes that during sleep 
the sphincter of the bladder is apt to become 
relaxed, and when a child lies horizontally in 
bed a little urine passes the sphincter, enters 
the deep urethra, and causes strong reflex 
action of the detrusor, when the bladder is 
emptied. — It is well known that in nocturnal 
enuresis in children the urine does not leak 
away gradually, but is emptied at once. In 
order to prevent the passage of the urine into 
the urethra during sleep, a simple expedient 
is adopted, namely, the elevation of the pelvis, 
so that an accumulation of urine of ordinary 
amount will gravitate back and distend the 
fundus, and not press against the sphincter. 
The elevation is secured by allowing the child 
only a single small, flat pillow under the 
head, and placing one or two ordinary pil- 
lows under the thighs so that they are at an 
angle of 130 to 150 degrees with the spine. 
This measure proved successful in twelve 
cases; it was, however, found necessary to

Acute Rheumatic Endocarditis. — As soon as 
the first indication of a bruit makes its ap- 
pearance, give sodium iodide in ten-grain 
doses thrice daily, in addition to the sali- 
cylates, and apply a blister of the size of a 
florin over the apex; as soon as the irrita- 
tion of this blister subsides, a second may be 
applied close to it; then a third, and so on — 
the patient being kept meantime as quiet as 
possible, exertion, exposure, and excess of 
nitrogenous food being strictly forbidden. 
A gradual subsidence of the bruit will fre- 
quently be noticed in from seven to ten days. 
Of thirty-nine cases thus treated, twenty- 
nine were discharged with normal heart- 
sounds, ten with a bruit. This exceptionally 
good result may be in part due to prolonged 
rest, the average duration of hospital resi- 
dence being forty-one days, and of confine- 
ment to bed thirty-six days. — Doctor Rich- 
ard Caton, in Liverpool Medico- Chirurgical 
Journal. 



Lupus Vulgaris Treated by the Burning

trating the rays of the sun under a lens — 
thus destroying by a burning process. By 
this means I was completely cured, and there 
has been no return during four years. I have 
since treated other patients and brought the 
method to the attention of many physicians, 
who have approved of it. — M. Mehl, in Neue 
Heilkunst. 

[This is by no means a new proposition, 
but has been advocated several times by prac- 
titioners in the United Kingdom, on the 
Continent, and in America; it has been em- 
ployed also with greater or less success by 
Orientals. In 1867, an account of a similar 
procedure appeared in Braithwaites Retro- 
spect, the author claiming it to be "a painless 
method, as the nerves are destroyed at 
once." — Ed.] 



Tapeworm. — Doctor Wilson recently ex- 
hibited before the Toronto Medical Society a 
tapeworm tied in two knots, recently passed 
in this condition by a girl three years of age, 
who had a history of dieting on raw meat. 
The anthelmintic employed was pumpkin 
seeds. In adults he obtained the best results 
from thymol, given in twelve-grain doses 
every fifteen minutes until two drachms were 
taken.— A dose of castor oil should be ad- 
ministered the preceding night, and the pa- 
tient refrain from taking supper or breakfast. 
About twenty minutes after the last dose a 
purgative is given. If the thymol depresses 
the circulation, whiskey may be administered 
concurrently. 

Doctor Oldright remarked he used pump- 
kin seeds a good deal. One method of pre- 
paring was to take a half-pound, bruise in a 
mortar, add one quart of water, and allow to 
macerate all night; then strain, and add 
enough water to make a pint, and give after 
fasting. Two hours afterward an active pur- 
gative should be given. — Canadian Medical 
Review. 



Which Canaliculus to Slit. — In the use of 
the large probes it may seem a matter of no 
importance whether the upper or the lower 
canaliculus is selected to suffer the necessary 
mutilation. The results, however, are far 
better and more easily attained by selecting 
the upper instead of the lower. I adopted 
this method many years ago from observing 
many patients who had been treated by divi- 
sion of the lower canaliculi, whose nasal 
ducts were perfectly patent, but who never- 
theless still suffered from constant epiphora, 
and whose watery eyes were noticeable to the 



most casual observer. Since I have divided 
the upper canaliculus there has been no fail- 
ure to relieve the epiphora where I succeeded 
in curing the stricture. — Doctor J. B. Story, 
in Ophthalmic Review. 



Chestnut Leaves in Whooping -Cough. — The 
fluid extract of Chestnut Leaves was first rec- 
ommended for whooping-cough in 1862, and 
since that time has been used by the profes- 
sion to some extent, but not as generally as 
it should be. Ten drops may be given four 
times a day in a little sweetened water. Of 
twenty-five cases — three under six months, 
six under two years, the others from two to 
fifteen years of age — Castanea completely 
relieved each and every one in from eight to 
fourteen days. In experimenting with this 
drug for other coughs, I have not seen the 
slightest improvement; its sphere of action, 
therefore, would seem wholly in the relief of 
pertussis. — Doctor Ingalls, in Medical 
Times. 



Cold Air for Consumptives. — There are now 
six sanitariums in Germany at which con- 
sumptives are treated by constant exposure 
to air at a low temperature. Currents of 
cold air are allowed to pass through the bed- 
room at night, and during the day as much 
of the time is spent in the open air as pos- 
sible. The pure cold air quiets cough, lessens 
temperature, arrests night sweats, improves 
appetite, and modifies or arrests the course 
of the disease. Observations made in these 
sanitariums have developed the interesting 
fact that it is exceedingly rare indeed that 
infection of healthy persons by contact with 
consumptive inmates is observed. — Kansas 
Medical Journal. 



Palliative Treatment of Hay Fever. — Dis- 
card the use of sprays, and apply to the 
nostrils, on a cotton pledget, an unguent 
composed of six parts cocaine muriate, ten 
of carbolic acid, twenty of menthol, 120 of 
oil of sweet almonds, 240 of zinc ointment. 

While in this preparation cocaine is not the 
dominant ingredient, for some unexplained 
reason it is more active than cocaine in other 
forms. It is rare to find a case in which this 
application does not give almost immediate 
relief; at the same time general constitutional 
treatment should not be neglected. — Doctor 
F. G. Smith, in Medical Record.

Htoxin in Diphtheria. — Welch, of Johns 
Hopkins, in a review of the antitoxin treat- 
ment of diphtheria, points out that to be of 
most benefit it should be used early — that it 
does not counteract secondary infections. 1 1 e 
considers its effects are due to its action on 
the living cells of the body. He says that 
clinical experience shows that cases of diph- 
theria inherently refractory to timely treat- 
ment with antitoxin are most exceptional, if 
indeed they occur at all. As to the sequela?, 
he says the weight of evidence is that nephri- 
tis is far less common in cases early treated 
with the serum, but that it is questionable 
whether albuminuria is. — Canadian Medical 
Review. 



Lactophenin. — This crystalline powder, 
slightly soluble in water and with a some- 
what bitter taste, produces a decided hyp- 
notic effect. Von Jaksch found that in 
typhoid fever it always rapidly reduced the 
temperature and exercised a calming effect 
over restlessness and delirium. He employed 
it in pneumonia, erysipelas, and influenza, 
with the result that it nearly always reduced 
temperature, and that too for considerable 
time, without any untoward action upon the 
heart or respiration. The great value of 
the drug appears to be its sedative and anti- 
pyretic effect. — Dujardin-Beaumktx, in An- 
nual of the Universal Medical Sciences. 



Measles. — Measles in young infants may 
be followed by troublesome pulmonary symp- 
toms and severe inflammation of the eyes. 
In a recent case with the above complica- 
tions, Doctor Wells found fluid extract of 
Eucalyptus, in five-drop doses, gave relief 
from distressing cough. For the eyes, solu- 
tion of mercuric chloride (r to 12000) was 
employed, a drop or two being instilled twice 
daily, followed by washing with solution of 
borax in warm water. — Philadelphia Poly- 
clinic.

operate, subcutaneoiisly, by passing a D&lt;

vein, and out at the point of entrance; the 
Catgut ligature is then tied, which oblii- 
the vein; or the vein may be cut down upon 
veral inches of its course, the upper and 
lower ends ligated, the intervenii ..

together. Strict aseptic surgery should be 
followed to avoid septic phlebitis. — John B. 
RTS, in Philadelphia Polyclinic, 



Fevers. — Nature's method of reducing fever 
is by evaporation from the skin — by perspira- 
tion, — by exhalation from the lungs, by urine, 
and by discharges from the bowels. Strict 
attention should be given all these functions, 
and assistance furnished by such remedies as 
will accomplish the desired result with the 
least departure from and interference with 
normal action. Antipyretics which are at the 
same time stimulants are most worthy of con- 
fidence. — Atlanta Clinic. 

[This class of antipyretics excludes the 
synthetics and " antis," which are one and 
all nerve-depressants. — Ed.] 



The Dangers of Thyroid Feeding. — It is 
coming to the notice of physicians, that thy- 
roid tablets are being used by the laity, espe- 
cially by women who are desirous of ridding 
themselves of superfluous fat. As a result 
dangerous symptoms have been observed, 
and Doctor Eulenberg reports a case in 
which the patient took six tablets a day with 
the result of severe nervousness and cardiac 
complications. 

There can be no doubt that the use of 
thyroid tablets is dangerous and should only 
be employed under careful supervision. — 
Medical Record. 



Absinthe in Epilepsy.— This beverage is a 
remedy that I have been using for over 
twenty years in various nervous affections, 
more especially in epilepsy. I have derived 
more benefit from Absinthe in mild and in 
severe attacks of this disease than from any 
other remedy. I was first induced to give it 
in such cases from various accounts 1 had 
met with in French journals of its effects when 
used as a common drink. — Doctor J AMES 
Kitchen. 



THE MEDICAL AGE. 






Bronchial Adenopathy. — Each morning, fast- 
ing, a wineglassful of sulphuretted water with 
a little warm milk; cod liver oil; one sixty- 
fourth to one thirty-second grain of sodium 
arseniate daily, at meal times, followed in 
fifteen days by phosphates, tar-water, or ter- 
pin. As calmatives, two to three drops of 
belladonna tincture, and the same quantity 
of alcoholic extract of aconite root, and 
syrup of codeine. Revulsion of the affected 
area with iodine or croton oil. If possible, 
a season at sulphur springs to complete the 
cure. — Jules Simon, in Bulletin General de 
Therapeutique. 



For Relief of Night Sweats. — Hydrastis 
canadensis produces excellent results. If a 
single dose of twenty to thirty drops of the 
fluid extract does not suffice, give twenty-five 
to thirty minims two or three times daily; in 
nearly every case the sweats will be over- 
come. One writer reports seventy out of 
seventy three cases of night sweats in tuber- 
culosis radically relieved by this measure. — 
National Medical Review. 



Cough of Phthisis. — This may often be re- 
lieved by a teaspoonf ul, taken in water before 
meals, of the following mixture: 

Perchloride of iron, 3 drachms. 

Creosote, ■£$ drachm. 

Alcohol, 1 ounce. 

Glycerin, 2 ounces. 

Compound tincture gentian, 2 drachms. 

Malaga wine, to make 8 ounces. 

— The Practitioner (London). 



Distilled Water. — There is a growing 
opinion among medical men that pure dis- 
tilled water is very much better than any- 
mineral water in the market, in Bright's dis- 
ease and other kidney affections, and the 
best among the mineral waters are those 
that have the least minerals in them, or, in 
other words, that come the nearest to pure 
water. — Doctor E. C. Price, in Southern 
Journal. 



Cannabis Sativa. — My greatest experience 
has been in the treatment of phthisis pul- 
monalis, and here I cannot speak of this drug 
too highly, for, while it most perceptibly 
relieves the cough, it aids the patient by 
its stimulating and exhilarating qualities, 
supplying a remedial agent in a manner 
which in my opinion no other drug can so 
beneficially do. — Doctor Lees, in Medical 
Record. 



Senile Heart. — Cardinal rules with regard 
to diet. — There must never be less than five 
hours between meals: No solid food ever to 
be taken between meals: All with weak 
hearts should have their principal meal in the 
middle of the day: They should have their 
meals as dry as possible. — Balfour. 



Earache. — In the majority of cases this is 
caused by beginning inflammation of the 
middle ear, and in a few instances by neu- 
ralgia from exposure. The pain is often 
readily relieved by filling the ear full of 
warm water and giving aconite internally, 
or aconite and Pulsatilla. — Exchange. 



Alstonia Constricta. — According to Doctor 
Deitz, this drug is very useful in "disorders 
peculiar to women, which frequently prove 
quite rebellious even under the most care- 
fully conducted treatment." Debility depen- 
dent on lack of digestive power, is its key- 
note. 



A Hint for Chloroform Anaesthesia. — Rosen - 
bury advises, before administering chloro- 
form, spraying the nose with cocaine solution. 
By this means the reflex action of the heart is 
prevented and anaesthesia more readily pro- 
duced. — Medical Times and Hospital Gazette. 



Strychnine Poisoning. — When strychnine has 
been taken by mistake, or purposely, its effects 
may be counteracted by teaspoonful doses of 
tincture of Cannabis Indica, given every five 
to ten minutes until six or eight doses have 
been taken. — Prescription. 



Croup. — Two drops of fluid extract Jabo- 
randi every hour will be found to afford 
material benefit. It is especially indicated in 
those susceptible to hoarse cough, suggestive 
of croup, on every change of the weather. — 
Medical Brief. 



Elephantiasis of the Extremities. — Doctor 
Neff suggests, and moreover claims excellent 
results from, the use of rubber bandages in 
connection with an ointment of mercury ni- 
trite (one drachm to the ounce) well rubbed 
in. 



Value of Cotto?i-root Bark. — In doses of 
twenty to thirty minims of the fluid extract, 
continued for several days, this drug is most 
valuable in metrorrhagia, haemoptysis, hema- 
turia, and epistaxis. — Exchange.

effected, the most remarkable was that of 
Hugh Rice, of Piper City, 111. 

The best known mad-stone now at the

Poison of the Ornithorhvnchus. — The 
Physiological Laboratory of the University 
of Sydney publishes the observations by Doc- 
tors C. J. Martin and F. C. Tidswell on the 
femoral gland of the ornithorhynchus, and its 
secretion, with an experimental inquiry con- 
cerning its supposed toxic action. The essay 
contains a good historical rhume' of informa- 
tion in regard to the spur of the ornithorhyn- 
chus and the gland attached to it, from the 
first notice of it in 1802 by Home (who 
thought the spur was a copulative organ), to 
Jamieson, who in 1 Si 7 discovered the gland 
connected with the spur, the duct of which 
traversed the spur, and the secretion of 
which he had observed to produce a poison- 
ous effect on a man who had been endeavor- 
ing to capture a specimen after it had been 
wounded. Bennett and Owen were disin- 
clined to admit that it was an organ of 
offense, while Anderson Stuart has no doubt 
that it is, and adduces cases of dogs which 
suffered severely from the action of the poi- 
son, and his opinion coincides with that of 
Doctors Martin and Tidswell. These observ- 
ers have carefully examined the anatomy of 
the organ in question, with the following 
results: 

" The glands are whitish, uniform, situated 
on each side of the spine over the acetabulum 
and the femur, and just outside the gluteus 
maximus, and rest on the rectus, iliacus, and 
glutei medius and minimus muscles. The 
duct emerges from the posterior half of the

outer border of the gland, runs down the 
back of the leg to the tarsus, where it dilates 
into a sac and is then continued along the 
spur. The spur is about half an inch long 
and is attached to a supernumerary tarsal 
ossicle. The gland is invested by a layer of 
smooth muscle and is of a compound race- 
mose type; the alveoli are buried by a single 
layer, or in one case by four layers, of epithe- 
lial cells, the contents of which are granular. 
The duct, though apparently single, contains 
two or three channels imbedded in white 
fibrous tissue, without any admixture of 
smooth muscular tissue. Neither in the liv- 
ing nor in the dead animal can the secretion 
be made to exude by pressure. Chemical 
examination of the secretion shows that it 
contains proteids, and that these consist 
chiefly of some form of albumin, with a little 
proteose, but no nucleo albumin. The re- 
sults of experiments on various animals 
showed that there was an analogy between 
the venom of Australian snakes and the 
poison of the platypus, since both owe their 
toxic properties to proteid constituents; that 
they both retard or prevent the coagulation 
of the blood when slowly introduced into 
the system in small doses; that they both 
cause intra-vascular clotting when injected 
into the veins in sufficient doses; that they 
both cause an almost instantaneous drop in 
the pressure of the blood; and that they 
both cause capillary haemorrhages and oedema 
when locally applied." 

There is reason to believe that the secre- 
tion of the platypus is chiefly venomous at 
some particular season of the year, especially 
about the month of June. — The Lancet (Lon-

a small nut to an adult head, and may weigh 
several pounds. As a rule they are well 
defined, and the mucous membrane covering 
them may be either healthy, inflamed, ulcerat- 
ed, or even partially calcined. In two instances 
the surface of the tumor became the seat of 
an epithelioma, and in one the ulcer pene- 
trated the scar of a hypogastric incision, pro- 
jecting outside in the form of an enormous 
gangrenous mass. Other alterations of the 
urinary apparatus are often seen, viz., chronic 
vesical inflammation with columnar hyper- 
trophy of its wall and an ascending inflamma- 
tion of ureters, etc. In two cases the tumor 
had compressed the terminations of the ure- 
ters, leading to a double hydro-nephrosis. 
Clinically the symptoms differ according as 
the myoma grows into the bladder or towards 
the peritoneum. In the latter instance there 
are no vesical symptoms except increased 
frequency and some difficulty of micturition, 
and here the diagnosis may be very difficult. 
Where myomata project into the vesical cavity, 
diagnosis is much easier, as the usual symp- 
toms of vesical growth are present, and their 
form and consistence closely resemble uterine 
fibromata; symptoms may, moreover, vary 
according to the posture of the patient. 
Hypogastric, vaginal, rectal, and bimanual 
examination, with a sound in the bladder, 
may give valuable information as to shape, 
volume, consistency, and- mobility. 

In myomata of the excentric variety, lap- 
arotomy only can afford relief; in the vesical 
form, hypogastric cystotomy is necessary. It 
is suggested that the wound left in vesical 
mucous membrane, after removal of the 
tumor, should be sewn up. — Quarterly Medi- 
cal Review. 



Myomata of the Bladder. — MM. Fer- 
rier and Hartmannn have collected clinical 
details of sixteen undoubted cases of vesical 
myomata in which histological examination 
was made; the patients varying in age from 
twelve to seventy-four years. True vesical 
myomata are comparable to uterine myomata, 
arise in the thickness of the muscular layer 
of the bladder, and tend to become encapsu- 
lated, but, owing to the thinness of the vesical 
wall, project on one or other surface of the 
organ — i. &lt;?., they project either into the blad- 
der or into the abdomen. In the sixteen 
cases, ten were of the first character, four of 
the second, one an infiltrating myoma, and 
one presented an example of both varieties. 
Myomata projecting into the abdomen have 
a tendency to become pediculated in the peri- 
toneal cavity, or to spread in the cellular tis- 
sue, and like uterine myoma vary in size from 



Hysteric Simulation. — Doctor Mikuliez 
recently communicated to the Breslau Medical 
Society an interesting case of hysteric simu- 
lation in a woman of fifty-one years. After 
a slight trauma, in 1891, she was seized with 
pain and vomiting of blood, and later with 
faecal vomiting. These ceased, but reap- 
peared during the summer of 1892 in a more 
violent manner. The attending physician 
diagnosed a stricture high up in the rectum, 
and applied gradual dilatation with bougies. 
After transient improvement, faecal vomiting 
again set in, and a trial explorative laparot- 
omy was done, but nothing abnormal was 
found. Later there developed an abscess in 
the vicinity of the sacrum, followed by a free 
interval of several months. In 1893 vomit- 
ing again appeared, when a preternatural 
anus was formed, and, though it functionated 
well, the vomiting did not cease. Later,

vomit were found scybaLx, such as would be

lecture, she vomited up some faecal lumps 
covered with mucus. A stomach-tube was 
immediately introduced, and the gastric con- 
tents found to consist of innocent, sour-

slightest trace of a faeculent odor, while that

Ex i ra-genital Syphilis.— In children the 
primary chancre is rarely found, and the 
method of infection is almost always the 
same: the father brings the syphilis into the 
family, gives it to the mother, who does not 
perceive it until the lesions are evident and 
when the child is already contaminated. 
Generally the door of entry is the mouth, 
and the sign which draws the attention of 
the mother is the inflammation of the sub- 
maxillary glands. The evolution of infantile 
extra-genital syphilis is variable; in general 
it is very favorable, and in this respect forms 
a striking contrast with hereditary syphilis. 
Extra genital syphilis in the adult appears 
generally in the form of a primary sore, and 
usually the lips are the point of origin. 

Kxtra-genital infection varies greatly ac- 
cording to the country. In Russia it some- 
times reaches from fifty to ninety per cent, of 
all syphilitic cases, especially in the country

.re of these organs, as well as the general 
bodily health, — employing pure wool under- 
wear, and avoiding wet clothing; if these 
maladies occur, they should be promptly at- 
tended to. 

So also if middle-ear disease is present, it 
should be attended to at once, thereby pre- 
venting involvement of the internal ear and 
saving time, trouble, and discomfort. Middle- 
ear disease in the early stage is nearly always 
curable, and if advanced can usually be in 
some measure relieved. Cases of deafness 
arising from affections of the external ear are 
curable; those arising from affections of the 
internal ear are the most serious form, and 
are fortunately very rare. — Doctor Lauten-

Syphilis in THE Army vs. LICENSED Pros- 
TITUTON. — In the French Army the largest 
proportion of venereal disease was found in 
1875 — 74 P er 1000. In the English Army 
the proportion was 139 per 1000. The high- 
est figure was reached two years later, 274 
per 1000; while in the French Army the 
figure stood as low as 52 per 1000. From 
the figures it may be concluded that venereal 
disease is much more frequent in countries 
where free prostitution exists than in those 
where it is licensed. It should not be in- 
ferred from these statistics that the English 
soldier is more immoral than his Gallic con- 
frere. The French soldier, if he has the 
means, can provide himself with a mistress, — 
an institution unknown, as a rule, to the 
English soldier. Clandestine prostitution is 
greatly on the increase in France, especially 
since restrictions have been in great measure 
removed from the opening of liquor shops.—

Malaria and Microbks. — The head of 
the well known East Indian Chloroform Com- 
missions, Doctor Edward Lawrie, of Hyder- 
abad, emphatically declares there are no 
specific microbes in the blood in malaria, and 
that those investigators who have made such 
a claim have mistaken the nuclei of the white 
corpuscles for microbes. — New York Sun.
